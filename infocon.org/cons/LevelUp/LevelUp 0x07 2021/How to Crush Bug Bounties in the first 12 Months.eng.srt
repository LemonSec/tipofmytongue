2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,360
and for the next talk i

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,280
want to introduce luke stevens also

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,800
known as hack luke he

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,520
is one of those people that um

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,199
phenomenal hacker but loves to talk

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,960
about the mental side of bug bounties

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,160
that's a that's a flip

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,599
um and just really dives into you know

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,039
what it takes to be successful beyond

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,560
just the technical and i think it's a

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,399
very important area to cover

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,320
and uh this talk he's going to cover you

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,440
know zero to heaven

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,280
zero to hero how to cross bounties in

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,879
your first 12 months you know what what

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:39,680
are the things you want to know if

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,120
you're just starting out

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,399
how can i go from where i am now with

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,239
zero points zero bugs and no bug bounty

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,120
experience

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,559
to a successful bug bounty hunter

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,760
in 12 months or less that's what i asked

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,839
myself when i started doing bug bounties

25
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:09,630
[Music]

26
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,920
to answer this firstly i needed to

27
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,640
define

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,920
exactly what successful meant in this

29
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,799
phrase

30
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,520
so successful is a word that gets thrown

31
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,159
around

32
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,439
around a lot and its exact meaning

33
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,000
is basically totally up to the person

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,840
who's saying it or hearing it it's

35
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,280
highly subjective so i decided that

36
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,600
being a successful bug bounty hunter to

37
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,320
me

38
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,720
meant that i would be paid enough to

39
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,360
replace

40
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,240
a full-time salary not necessarily my

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,280
full-time salary

42
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,280
just a full-time salary that would cover

43
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,720
my expenses

44
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,880
um and i would do that all while

45
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,799
maintaining a healthy balance

46
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,960
in my life so on my quest to

47
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,759
achieve this i learned loads and i made

48
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:04,960
a lot of mistakes

49
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,119
but in the end i feel that i succeeded

50
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,520
in my first 12 months of bug bounties

51
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,599
i earned a decent uh average australian

52
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,760
uh probably the same in the us and and

53
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,800
europe and

54
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,120
and most countries i earned a decent

55
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,160
salary

56
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,040
so the goal of this talk is to provide

57
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,920
guidance

58
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,360
on how you can go from total zero

59
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,720
to a successful in that sense bug bounty

60
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,360
hunter

61
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,080
in the shortest time possible while

62
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,920
avoiding the mistakes that i made along

63
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,560
the way

64
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,920
right now if you've recently started

65
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,760
your bug bounty journey or you're

66
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,120
thinking about starting

67
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,800
you will get a lot of value from this

68
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,480
talk i hope and

69
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,480
if you've been doing bug bounties for a

70
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,519
while now

71
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,360
but you're struggling to like push

72
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,040
yourself to that next level

73
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,560
i think that you'll also get a lot of

74
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,120
value from this talk

75
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,440
now before i get into the nitty-gritty

76
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,040
technical details

77
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,360
on how to be a more successful bug

78
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,400
bounty hunter

79
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,480
there's something way more important

80
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,920
that we need to cover

81
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,800
and that is how to overcome the fear of

82
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,440
actually

83
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,159
starting okay because that is really the

84
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:14,879
first step

85
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,720
to being successful is starting in the

86
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,319
first place and it's

87
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,319
interestingly the step that trips the

88
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,440
most people up it's

89
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,280
it's the step that stops people from

90
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,480
actually

91
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,599
doing it right so fear of starting or we

92
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,640
can call it foss

93
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,680
fos comes in many forms you might know

94
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,080
it as

95
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,239
procrastination that's a that's a fear

96
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,200
of starting

97
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,920
or distraction that's a fear of starting

98
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,680
you might know it as

99
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,400
a fear of judgment from your friends or

100
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,280
family

101
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,200
or you might know it as a feeling of

102
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,760
inadequacy when you compare yourself to

103
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,799
like some other pro bug bounty hackers

104
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,239
out there when you see tweets of them

105
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:52,879
earning

106
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,760
you know five figures in a day and you

107
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,519
might have said to yourself things like

108
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,760
bug bounties are too hard because all

109
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,360
the bugs have already been found

110
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,720
or um the pro bug bouncy hunters on this

111
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,400
program are so good there's no way i'll

112
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,000
ever find any bugs

113
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,439
um that's all fear of starting as well

114
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,120
you might also just be scared of

115
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,360
investing your precious time and time is

116
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,079
precious

117
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,519
you might be scared of investing that

118
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,839
into by grantees because you fear that

119
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,358
you won't find any bugs

120
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,880
and all of that time that you invested

121
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,440
will be wasted let me tell you this

122
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,040
first and foremost from a bike bounty

123
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,160
hunter perspective

124
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,240
but also now i've seen i work for bug

125
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,759
crowd so i've seen the other side of the

126
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,160
coin as a triager i've seen a lot of the

127
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,520
uh the queues and things i can say to

128
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,360
you without any reservations

129
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,400
that it is absolutely 100

130
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,960
feasible for anyone to start doing bug

131
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,600
bounties

132
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,000
today no matter what level what skill

133
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,120
level you're at

134
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,440
you can start today right now and

135
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,520
succeed in earning decent money

136
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,040
within a year right

137
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,600
so all of this fear that is holding you

138
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,360
back from starting

139
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,479
is all in your head um

140
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,720
now in the past if if you follow me on

141
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,800
on maybe tik tok or youtube or whatever

142
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,479
you you'll know that i've made

143
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,479
some content about starting in the past

144
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,759
because it's something that

145
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,840
i'm really passionate about right and

146
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,080
the content that i make basically says

147
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,240
forget all of those fears and just do it

148
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,000
overcome your fears and just do it

149
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,560
right but i'll admit that sometimes it's

150
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,400
not quite that simple

151
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,039
and the reason is that these types of

152
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:31,680
fears are

153
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,479
deeply rooted within us and simply

154
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,080
ignoring the fear

155
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,000
it's not that simple right it can be

156
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,520
extremely difficult

157
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,560
now it's important to remember that your

158
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,360
brain

159
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,560
your primary decision maker doesn't care

160
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,840
whether you're successful in bug

161
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,600
bounties at all

162
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,440
your brain is just the result of

163
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,520
millions of years of evolution

164
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,919
and its predominant purpose is to help

165
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:56,560
you

166
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,800
to survive and the best way that it

167
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,000
knows how to do that

168
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,840
is to keep you within your comfort zone

169
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,039
to keep you safe

170
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,199
that's why naturally humans enjoy the

171
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,319
feeling of safety

172
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,039
and comfort we enjoy waking up in the

173
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,720
same bed every morning

174
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,800
we enjoy spending every day with the

175
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,840
same people

176
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,120
we work the same job for years we um

177
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,440
we're on the same projects for for

178
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,639
months or years

179
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,600
and we keep the same hobbies right

180
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,960
unfortunately

181
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,600
this primal survival instinct to keep us

182
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,360
safe and in our comfort zone

183
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,919
may also hold us back from starting new

184
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:32,560
things

185
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,680
or taking risks and that's because

186
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,560
to our brain doing this feels like a

187
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,560
risk to our survival doing new things

188
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,000
that we're not certain about

189
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,479
feels like feels like risk to our brain

190
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,039
so

191
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,880
how do we overcome this this primal fear

192
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,759
i think that the first step is awareness

193
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,680
every time that an excuse slips into

194
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,880
your head or you find yourself

195
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,880
procrastinating or something

196
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,400
so basically you're stopping yourself

197
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,080
from starting something that will

198
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,520
clearly benefit your life

199
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,360
like learning something new or

200
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,360
exercising or whatever it is

201
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,680
recognize the excuse for what it is it's

202
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,720
an excuse

203
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,039
and it's bred out of fear and it's not

204
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,639
necessarily rational fear

205
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,199
right and then the second step is to

206
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,479
recognize that

207
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,720
by not starting that thing whether it's

208
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,319
bug bounties or something else

209
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,039
you're only cheating yourself nobody

210
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,360
else cares whether you start or not

211
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,199
nobody else cares whether you succeed or

212
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,280
not even most of the time right

213
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,199
but if you want to go on living how

214
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,479
you're living now

215
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,599
and not bring that thing into your life

216
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,199
whether it's bug bounties or something

217
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:37,759
else

218
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,919
go ahead don't bring it into your life

219
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,599
keep living how you're living now

220
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,120
nobody's going to stop you from what

221
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,599
you're already doing but if you want to

222
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,080
actually grow you're going to need to

223
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,840
pucker up the courage to start

224
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,319
and then dive right in you need to log

225
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,080
out of youtube and netflix

226
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,160
turn your phone off put yourself in a

227
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,599
space where you can focus

228
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,240
and eliminate all distractions right

229
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,960
because

230
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,240
otherwise you're going to have every

231
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,919
excuse under the sun to procrastinate

232
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,199
like your phone's going to beep or

233
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,879
you'll get a message on slack

234
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,639
or you know you've got this netflix

235
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,160
series that's that's really taking all

236
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,039
your attention

237
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,199
so turn all of that off and then take a

238
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,690
deep breath and then just start

239
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:18,730
[Music]

240
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,960
that's enough pep talking hopefully by

241
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,479
now you are convinced

242
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,520
to take action to actually start right

243
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,000
but what does that even mean what's the

244
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,440
first thing that we need to do

245
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,960
it's all very well to be fired up and

246
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,958
ready to start but what's the actual

247
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,039
first thing that you're going to do when

248
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,000
you sit down

249
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,039
in front of your computer now i would

250
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,760
recommend that you first focus on

251
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,240
education whether you're a total cyber

252
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,240
security newbie or you're a seasoned pen

253
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,800
tester

254
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,959
you will still need to spend some time

255
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,560
on bug bounty related

256
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,320
education because even if you're coming

257
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,320
from pentesting bug bounties are really

258
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,480
different make no mistake okay

259
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,000
in my opinion hands down the best guide

260
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,320
to starting bug bounties is the bug

261
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,320
bounty hunter methodology by jason

262
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,040
haddocks

263
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,680
he's just released version four there

264
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,959
are actually two

265
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,680
version four uh bug bouncy hunter

266
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,519
methodologies by jason haddix there's

267
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,959
there's the recon one

268
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,120
and the application hacking one so

269
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,800
definitely check out both of them

270
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,959
the recon one you can find on youtube

271
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,800
the application hacking one was

272
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,279
earlier today it was released before

273
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,080
this talk

274
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,680
i haven't seen it yet but i know that

275
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,200
it's absolutely amazing because

276
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,800
jason haddocks did it and everything

277
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,560
that guy does is amazing

278
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,560
but check out both of them they're both

279
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,000
going to be amazing primers

280
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,720
to how to actually find bugs and how to

281
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,080
kind of set up your workflow and

282
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,440
everything for bug bounties

283
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,959
to be successful now a couple of other

284
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,399
really great resources that i would

285
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,279
recommend

286
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,839
education wise the web application

287
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,040
hackers handbook

288
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,959
is basically the bible of web

289
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,240
application testing

290
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,720
but it comes with a caveat right

291
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,240
basically

292
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,279
it's a very long dry book about every

293
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,000
single

294
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
well not every but a lot of different

295
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,519
vulnerability types that you can find in

296
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,640
web applications

297
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,160
and if you try to pick it up and read it

298
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,399
from page one to page like 700 or

299
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,440
whatever it is

300
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,440
then you're gonna you're gonna get sick

301
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,560
of it and you're not gonna make it all

302
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,600
the way through the book because it's

303
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,320
quite dry

304
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,120
okay but the way that i think you should

305
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,640
be using the web application hackers

306
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,279
handbook

307
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,160
is as a reference so whenever you kind

308
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:24,399
of

309
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,160
hear about a new type of vulnerability

310
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
say you hear about sql injections

311
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,839
you can look it up in the web

312
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,519
application hacker's handbook and

313
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,120
it will have like a lot of information

314
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,480
there about that particular type of

315
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,120
vulnerability and how to discover it

316
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,000
for a more practical education like

317
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,480
really

318
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,200
hands-on hacking i would recommend pen

319
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,320
tester lab

320
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,120
so pentest lab um they have a lot of

321
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,839
free

322
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,760
stuff like free labs that you can

323
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,959
download and

324
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,720
uh there'll be a bunch of exercises

325
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,480
there that you can kind of

326
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,880
just like hack on in your own time which

327
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,000
will teach you

328
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,440
different types of vulnerabilities like

329
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,680
the obos top 10 but also

330
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,720
um really new cves like typically not

331
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,600
long after

332
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,480
a cve gets released in some popular

333
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,399
framework or something like that

334
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,720
sniff will have uploaded a lab to

335
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,680
pentester lab

336
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,240
but yeah there's free exercises that go

337
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,680
through the basic stuff which are really

338
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,160
good

339
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,079
and if you find that helpful then you

340
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,320
can pay for the pro version which is

341
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,720
for what it is it's really cheap for for

342
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,920
the for the amount of

343
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,360
training and the amount of knowledge you

344
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,200
can get from pentester lab it's a very

345
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,640
good return on investment so i'd

346
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,079
recommend paying for it by the way i'm

347
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,839
not getting sponsored by pentester lab

348
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,920
i just really like it and sniff's a good

349
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,440
guy

350
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,640
and the the last kind of

351
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,839
educational resource i'm going to

352
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,839
recommend there are so many educational

353
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,040
resources out there but i'm trying to

354
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,480
keep it down to a few

355
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,279
because i really i don't want to give

356
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,480
you too much information

357
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,399
i i would rather just give you the few

358
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,160
things and you can focus on all of these

359
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,760
because there's not too many here

360
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,519
and hopefully you won't feel overwhelmed

361
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,880
you can just you know which ones to

362
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,600
focus on

363
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,920
so yeah the last resource would be

364
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,360
following hackers

365
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,360
on all the platforms whether that's

366
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,959
twitter youtube

367
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,880
github twitch um and any other platform

368
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,480
that they might be on so

369
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,079
i'm pretty hesitant to list uh

370
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,240
to list actual hackers to follow because

371
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,680
there are so many great ones

372
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,160
and i cannot list them all or remember

373
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,880
them all

374
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,120
and i'll definitely be leaving a stack

375
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,160
of them out but

376
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,200
but a few that spring to mind are

377
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,480

goes on right you can see why i didn't

391
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,519
want to list them all but

392
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,760
i ended up listing quite a few just

393
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,680
anyone who is either

394
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,680
very successful at bounties or releasing

395
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,480
good content about bounties or both

396
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,480
if you're looking for a really great

397
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,920
list of people to follow

398
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,839
you can go to my twitter profile which

399
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,000
is twitter.comclick

400
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,440
um which you can see there and um you

401
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,959
can just like go to like who i'm

402
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,160
following and just go follow follow

403
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,880
follow

404
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,560
follow all of those people because

405
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,480
there's a bunch of great people there

406
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,600
um yeah so if you're following these

407
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,880
people you're literally

408
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,360
surrounding yourself with greatness

409
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,800
you're surrounding yourself with

410
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,040
the things that you want to achieve and

411
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,959
not only is this good motivation

412
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,240
it's also good in a very practical sense

413
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,880
because

414
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,399
every time they share something bug

415
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,880
bounty related you have the opportunity

416
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,600
to learn from it

417
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,839
so the next thing that will put you on

418
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,880
the right path

419
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,160
to bug bounty success is consistency

420
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,920
and habits and that's what then that's

421
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,199
the next thing that i want to talk about

422
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:07,760
so

423
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,680
just for a quick analogy because i love

424
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,040
a good analogy

425
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,360
let's say that there are two identical

426
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,079
twins

427
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,360
who are both extremely unfit

428
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,440
right and they both decide that they're

429
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,720
gonna get fit

430
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,240
so the first one decides that they're

431
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,240
going to do a hundred push-ups

432
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,639
every day and the second one decides

433
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,600
that they're going to do

434
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,399
10 push-ups a day five days a week the

435
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,600
question is

436
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,320
after five years who is more likely to

437
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,040
succeed

438
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,399
in getting fit now think about that

439
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,279
carefully

440
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,959
right it's gonna divide people i think

441
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,279
but i would be putting my money on the

442
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,399
guy who is doing

443
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,279
10 push-ups a day five days a week the

444
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,399
reason is that

445
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,639
i don't think that a hundred push-ups

446
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,440
per day

447
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,639
is a sustainable habit the second twin

448
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,639
chose a much more reasonable 10 push-ups

449
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,240
per day and only five days a

450
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,160
week and this is a habit that is

451
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,279
sustainable

452
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,720
over the extreme long term right

453
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,120
so let's say that the first twin despite

454
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,720
being extremely unfit

455
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,839
managed to do 100 push-ups on monday

456
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,920
on tuesday morning he's going to be

457
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,880
waking up

458
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,680
with a very sore chest and likely won't

459
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,519
do any push-ups on tuesday

460
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,519
by wednesday he might be feeling a bit

461
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,440
better and do another 100

462
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,240
but then the next two days he decides to

463
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,839
take off because his muscles are too

464
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:30,480
sore

465
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,880
and then saturday he does another 100

466
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,959
and then sunday he takes off so

467
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,759
in total the first twin has done 300

468
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:38,800
push-ups

469
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,759
in the first week but his fatal flaw is

470
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,079
that

471
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,639
he didn't build any habits because his

472
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,759
push-up schedule was

473
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,199
all over the place because his muscles

474
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,279
were too sore and because he didn't

475
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,320
build a habit

476
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,160
in the following weeks he kept

477
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,759
forgetting to do push-ups on various

478
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:54,320
days

479
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,920
and eventually gave up on the idea

480
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,720
altogether on the other hand

481
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,120
the second twin woke up every morning

482
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,720
and did 10 push-ups before doing

483
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,920
anything else

484
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,920
straight out of bed did 10 push-ups

485
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,199
after a week or two

486
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,000
doing these push-ups became a habit and

487
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,839
they became part of his lifestyle

488
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,680
so even though the first twin may have

489
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,279
appeared to be the one that would

490
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,240
succeed

491
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,240
and while he may have done more push-ups

492
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,279
in the short term

493
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,880
the second twin continued with his

494
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,800
schedule for five years

495
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,199
because it became part of his lifestyle

496
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,480
overall of course

497
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,279
the second twin did way more push-ups

498
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,320
than the first twin

499
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,160
in the long term right the difference

500
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,480
between the two was that the second twin

501
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,320
knows the power of small

502
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,399
incremental changes that are applied

503
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,519
consistently

504
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,360
so bringing this back to bug bounties

505
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,120
okay because we're getting too far into

506
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,120
the push-up thing

507
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,040
i get a lot of people messaging me

508
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,199
saying i'm gonna spend 10 hours a day

509
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,800
every day doing bug bounties and

510
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,959
learning to hack but what happens is

511
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,800
they don't stick to it and the whole

512
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,480
hustle culture thing is to blame for

513
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,360
this right

514
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,199
people you know like people are just

515
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,880
being like hustle hustle hustle grind

516
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,000
grind grind

517
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,839
and um you know to a point it's true but

518
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,319
you need to know the difference between

519
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,359
um i think like hustling like like

520
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,640
actually doing work and wearing yourself

521
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,520
into the ground

522
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,599
right someone who's who's decided

523
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,720
they're going to do

524
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,720
bug bounties for 10 hours a day or learn

525
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,079
bug bounties for 10 hours a day or

526
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:24,559
something

527
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,079
they crafted these goals when they were

528
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,160
feeling extremely motivated and i get it

529
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,840
because this happens to me as well when

530
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,440
i'm really motivated i set goals that

531
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,400
are too high

532
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,200
but when the grind sets in i realized

533
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:35,520
that

534
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,320
i was too ambitious and then you know

535
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,919
you can't help but feel like you've

536
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:40,640
failed

537
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,600
right and it sets off this whole like

538
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,679
negative spiral and you end up resenting

539
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:46,640
bug bounties

540
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,280
so just trust me it's better to set

541
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,480
sustainable

542
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,280
realistic habits that can be applied

543
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,039
over long stretches of time

544
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,960
and this is where the magic happens this

545
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,880
is where you really start to amass a

546
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,240
huge trove of knowledge

547
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,559
that you can apply to bounties so when

548
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,080
you're planning out your time

549
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,600
or you're planning out your schedule or

550
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,039
you're planning out like your learning

551
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,799
habits for bug bounties or

552
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,799
whatever you're doing just set a little

553
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,280
bit of time to do it every day don't set

554
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,880
10 hours per day as a goal maybe just

555
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,280
set

556
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,520
one hour or something that you feel that

557
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,120
you can comfortably do

558
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,000
consistently

559
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,640
the next thing that i wanted to talk

560
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,320
about is automation

561
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,400
now i think it's fair to say that there

562
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,200
are two streams of bug bounty hunters

563
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,200
one stream focuses more heavily on

564
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,799
automation and scanning

565
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,880
and the other stream focuses more on

566
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,000
deep diving

567
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,080
and if you look at the the leaderboards

568
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,400
on major bug bouncy platforms you'll see

569
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,240
both types of hackers there so you can

570
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,240
do well either way

571
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,440
but if you're starting now i recommend

572
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,520
that you first build out your automation

573
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,720
and there are a couple of reasons for

574
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,200
that

575
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,440
firstly even if you are more inclined to

576
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,799
be a deep diver

577
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,960
and in other words like you want to go

578
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,799
very deeply into one specific

579
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,880
application and find bugs in that

580
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,720
having excellent automation will allow

581
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,919
you to more quickly

582
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,000
and accurately determine where to focus

583
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,960
your efforts

584
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,360
so it's all very well focusing on the

585
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,559
main application

586
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,200
but maybe you could deep dive on some

587
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,640
other application

588
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,280
that your automation kind of found

589
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:19,919
through its

590
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,240
reconnaissance and you'll have a lot

591
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,080
more luck doing that

592
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,559
secondly a good automation system can

593
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,679
earn money for you

594
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,360
through bounties passively now as i said

595
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,039
at the start of this video we are

596
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,640
defining success

597
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,880
as being able to earn a full-time salary

598
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,960
without sacrificing our lifestyle

599
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,559
and the perfect way to do this is to

600
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,160
generate passive income

601
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,360
right now if all of your bugs are being

602
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,160
found by you

603
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,400
manually then you are essentially

604
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,440
trading time

605
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,039
for money similar to having a job right

606
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,200
which is fine as long as you enjoy what

607
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,880
you're doing but it does

608
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,799
limit your potential for growth and if

609
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,799
you want the income to be reliable

610
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,720
and consistent then you need to keep

611
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,559
working and keep grinding

612
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,720
every single day to earn those but and

613
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,919
those bounties that you're finding

614
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:08,960
manually

615
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,919
but if we develop um an automation

616
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,240
system that earns us money passively

617
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,919
then we can take a break whenever we

618
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,840
want and still be finding bugs

619
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,480
although it can take a while to create

620
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,240
an automation system that generates

621
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,440
passive income

622
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,039
once it's set up properly it will

623
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,039
continue to earn you money

624
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,039
for as long as you leave it scanning so

625
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,559
that's super exciting

626
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,280
just to really nail this point home i've

627
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,320
made a spreadsheet

628
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,480
okay and keep in mind that the numbers

629
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,520
on this spreadsheet

630
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,720
are kind of kind of a little bit guessy

631
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,520
like uh they're not necessarily accurate

632
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,559
to you

633
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,200
but uh they've just they're just numbers

634
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,880
that i've chosen to demonstrate the

635
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,360
point

636
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,520
okay so on the left hand column here you

637
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,480
can see

638
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,679
that i've got the month and this is from

639
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,960
january 2020

640
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,840
it goes all the way down to december

641
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,280
2039 this is the hours

642
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,600
spent the column b this is the hours

643
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,120
spent on bounties

644
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,760
every month so this is basically an

645
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,559
average because

646
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,080
every month's different length you have

647
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,840
to kind of average it out so in this

648
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,400
case

649
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,720
what i've done is i've done two hours

650
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,840
after work

651
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,039
so two hours five days a week 52 weeks a

652
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:21,440
year

653
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,919
okay and that rounds out to be 43 and a

654
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,520
third hours per week

655
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,880
a per month sorry and then in column c

656
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,799
we can see the amount earned now i've

657
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,400
been quite generous here i've said from

658
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,200
day one

659
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,640
from the first month you're going to

660
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,720
earn ten thousand dollars

661
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,200
a month okay been very very generous for

662
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,600
the manual hacking here

663
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,960
and if we go all the way down if we do

664
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,720
that for 20 years we don't take any

665
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,360
breaks

666
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,799
we own ten thousand dollars a month

667
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,120
every single month or on average

668
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,760
we end up earning 2.4 million dollars in

669
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,480
20 years

670
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,280
okay so how does that compare to what we

671
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,280
might earn doing automation

672
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,559
well let's let's find out so we take the

673
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,039
number of hours that we've spent and

674
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,720
let's just assume that

675
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,360
we can spend 10 hours coding something

676
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,520
and that will make us back on average

677
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,400
30 dollars per month so that's pretty

678
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,159
doable i think if you if you think about

679
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:16,880
it like this

680
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,480
you could spend 10 hours coding

681
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,480
something and then at some point in the

682
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,520
next 10 months

683
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,360
you're going to get a 300 bounty back

684
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,480
from that i think that's pretty

685
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,520
reasonable

686
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,280
so basically what we do um

687
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,960
we've got to figure out the formula so

688
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,799
we want to get

689
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,039
this number the hours spent in that week

690
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,600
and divided by 10. so now we've got

691
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,919
units of 10 hours and we times that by

692
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,360
30 because we're making

693
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,880
30 dollars for every 10 hours okay

694
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,600
so that means that we end up making 130

695
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,959
um per

696
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,080
month yes but when we're doing

697
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,200
automation

698
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,600
uh you have to remember that actually

699
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,520
it's not just 130

700
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,880
for this month that that 40 uh that

701
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,039
43 hours that we spent coding this

702
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,159
automation

703
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,039
will serve us every single month for the

704
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,159
next 20 years

705
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,679
all right so um we've already put in the

706
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:16,080
work

707
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,200
to earn this to earn this 130 this 130

708
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,760
every single month for the next 20 years

709
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,400
so the following month we can take the

710
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,840
previous month's

711
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,039
efforts and money that we've earned but

712
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,720
we spend the same amount of time coding

713
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,320
more automation which is going to earn

714
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,840
us the same amount of money it'll earn

715
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,159
us another 130 dollars this month

716
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,520
so this month we earn 260 and then

717
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,640
this time for the third month march 2020

718
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,679
we can take again the 260 which is the

719
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,440
previous two months work

720
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,760
and then we add on another 130 because

721
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,480
this month

722
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,880
we spent the same amount of time coding

723
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,840
okay

724
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,640
now as you can see these numbers when

725
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,080
you when you compare them

726
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,279
to the manual hunting are very bad

727
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,440
okay we're earning in the hundreds

728
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,279
instead of the

729
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,760
the thousands okay so earning even after

730
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,080
three months running 390 dollars

731
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,120
instead of 10 000 but the real magic

732
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,000
happens

733
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,200
when you start to pull this down over a

734
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,400
long stretch

735
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
so in this case we're doing it over 20

736
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,559
years in total right

737
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,760
scrolling down and there we go

738
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,960
so we end up with a total of 3.7

739
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,760
million dollars instead of 2.4 million

740
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,200
dollars

741
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,480
now it's also important to note that

742
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,039
the longer we spend on our automation

743
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:39,840
the

744
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,200
the more money that we're going to be

745
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,520
making every month regardless of whether

746
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,720
we work that month

747
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,520
or not so let's say after 20 years we're

748
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,080
like

749
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,640
okay i call it quits i'm sick of coding

750
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,440
automation

751
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,520
i'm sick of doing bug hunting i'm just

752
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,120
gonna coast from now on

753
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,919
well you're in luck because even if you

754
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,360
stop after 20 years

755
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,640
you're still going to be making 31 200

756
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,559
every single month from your automation

757
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,320
that you've spent 20 years

758
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,960
building okay but that goes for any

759
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,840
point at

760
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,159
absolutely any point let's say after a

761
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,120
year

762
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,080
uh so what is it december 2020 or let's

763
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,080
say january 2021 okay

764
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,000
so you've gone from january 2020 and

765
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,760
then it gets to january 2021

766
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,799
and you're like i'm going to have a

767
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,799
break here and i'm not going to do

768
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,159
anything for a few months

769
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,000
well during that time you're still

770
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,440
earning one thousand five hundred and

771
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,640
sixty dollars a month

772
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,120
okay when you're doing nothing whereas

773
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,480
if you do nothing

774
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,720
for a manual the manual hunting method

775
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,840
you're earning zero

776
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,520
because you'd have to just delete this

777
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,360
right and that

778
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,400
is the power of automation

779
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,960
now let me be very clear about those

780
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,080
figures once again

781
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,559
they are flawed in many ways i'll admit

782
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,679
okay for example

783
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,159
you won't get 30 per month for every 10

784
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,360
hours you spend coding

785
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,799
sometimes you might make more than that

786
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,320
though and sometimes you might might

787
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,840
make less so i tried to kind of average

788
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,720
it out

789
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,440
also you're you're unlikely to spend 20

790
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,159
years

791
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,919
on bug dante's okay a lot of things are

792
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,520
going to happen in your life

793
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,320
in 20 years also if you're earning 10 or

794
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,360
20 000

795
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,440
per month from bounties you'd probably

796
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,200
um up the amount of time that you're

797
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,240
spending on bounties

798
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,520
and down the amount of time you're

799
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,679
spending on like maybe your day job or

800
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:20,720
whatever so

801
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,080
you know the figures would kind of

802
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,080
adjust to spending depending on how

803
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,480
how many hours you're spending um doing

804
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,840
bounties as well

805
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,400
and uh also from the manual hacking side

806
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,400
you're very very unlikely to be earning

807
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,840
ten thousand dollars per month

808
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,840
from the first month okay but as you

809
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,960
gain more experience

810
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,360
it's actually possibly doable on average

811
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,880
to earn ten thousand dollars per month

812
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,000
there are a lot of people that are

813
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,919
actually doing that now

814
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,279
but the point i'm trying to make

815
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,000
basically from a financial standpoint

816
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,039
is that passive income is super super

817
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:51,760
powerful

818
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,320
and automation in bug bounties gives you

819
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,279
the ability

820
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,400
to bring passive income from bug

821
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,039
bounties

822
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,840
which is just amazing now just to hedge

823
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,720
your bets

824
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,039
and keep you motivated i would recommend

825
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,640
adopting an approach to bug bounties

826
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,440
where you do

827
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,919
both streams i'd recommend splitting

828
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:10,559
your time

829
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,640
roughly in half and then spending half

830
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,679
the time on

831
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,840
automation coding your bug bouncy

832
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,760
automation and then the other half

833
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,640
on manual hacking that will make you a

834
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,320
very well-rounded hacker

835
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,039
who's taking full advantage of the whole

836
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,320
bug bounty spectrum

837
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,879
and that is what i actually do myself

838
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,399
i hope that now you're convinced about

839
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,159
the power of automation and you

840
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:36,720
understand

841
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,200
why i spend a lot of time on it but the

842
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,640
next question that i'm sure is in your

843
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,360
head would be

844
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,679
what exactly do i automate so i wanted

845
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,200
to speak about that a bit

846
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,760
so firstly you need to think about data

847
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,399
storage

848
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,080
before you think about anything else

849
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,440
think about data storage

850
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,320
you need an organized scalable way to

851
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:54,799
store

852
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,480
all of the data that's captured by your

853
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,799
automation now i chose to do this in a

854
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,080
relational database

855
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,240
but some some people find that text

856
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,200
files work for them

857
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,440
right but you have to think about text

858
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,080
files there's no way to do relations or

859
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,960
no easy way

860
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,600
to do relationships so i like to be able

861
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,320
to relate

862
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,760
for example a platform to a program

863
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,200
to a root domain to a subdomain

864
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,120
and all that kind of thing so it doesn't

865
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,399
really matter honestly whether you

866
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:22,880
choose

867
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,039
uh like what kind of data storage you

868
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,159
that you uh

869
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,399
choose as long as it's organized and

870
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,360
scalable

871
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,399
and easily searchable so

872
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,320
another thing to consider here is what

873
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,760
what kind of data do you actually want

874
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,120
to store do you want to just store

875
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,960
subdomains or do you want to do ip

876
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,960
addresses dns records

877
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,720
http responses maybe or like the html

878
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,799
titles maybe just that or

879
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,919
status codes http

880
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,240
response status codes what about port

881
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,200
numbers

882
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,200
basically the more data that you capture

883
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,960
the more analysis you can do

884
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,880
but also the more storage that you'll

885
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,720
need so it's worth planning this out

886
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,159
before you start

887
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,080
and once you've planned out how to store

888
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,440
that data that you capture

889
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,679
and you've decided on what kind of data

890
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,200
you actually want to keep and what you

891
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,399
want to throw out

892
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,120
you need to think about alerting so how

893
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,399
do you want to be notified when your

894
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,320
automation discovers something

895
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,240
personally i've got my own slack

896
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,559
workspace and i just use the slack api

897
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,520
for alerting

898
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,200
but there are loads of other services

899
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,640
that you could use that might actually

900
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,000
work better for you

901
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,799
alternatively again you can just store

902
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,640
output in a text file and check it

903
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,159
regularly

904
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,399
now when it comes to alerting the other

905
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:35,440
thing to think about

906
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,880
is what you actually want to be notified

907
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,520
about

908
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,640
so when i first set up my automation

909
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,360
i generated a slack message for every

910
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,600
time a subdomain got discovered but

911
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,840
of course i ended up getting thousands

912
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,760
and thousands of slack messages

913
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,559
every day which leads to notification

914
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,679
fatigue right

915
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,240
and i would just end up ignoring all of

916
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,919
the notifications and and i couldn't be

917
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,200
bothered scrolling back through them to

918
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,360
find anything that was useful so

919
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,000
there are a few ways around this right

920
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,919
to solve this notification fatigue

921
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:08,480
problem

922
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,000
and the first way is to batch

923
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,080
notifications so for example

924
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,640
maybe once every 24 hours maybe in the

925
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,279
morning

926
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,960
your automation can send you a single

927
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,960
message containing a list of all of the

928
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,960
new subdomains that have been discovered

929
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,799
within that last 24 hours

930
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,200
that way if if on that day you want to

931
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,880
do some deep diving

932
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,880
some deeper hacking you can just do it

933
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,480
on those targets which are more likely

934
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,520
to be fresh

935
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,720
right the second way is to

936
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,159
heavily curate the notifications um

937
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,240
heavily curate what you're actually

938
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,200
notified about

939
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,440
so for example you might want to limit

940
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,120
your notifications to actual

941
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,320
vulnerabilities that have been

942
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,039
discovered

943
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,320
and not not any recon results

944
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,240
and then the last way is to separate

945
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,840
your notifications into different

946
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,799
channels so

947
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,279
if you're using slack you might send

948
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,600
recon results to a recon channel

949
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,399
which is muted probably and then send

950
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,320
your actual vulnerability discoveries

951
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,320
to a dedicated vulnerability channel

952
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
with its own notification settings

953
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,600
so you can get notified of

954
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,519
vulnerabilities and then if you want to

955
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,960
check the latest recon results you can

956
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,960
just go to that channel manually

957
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,240
now yeah that's what i do so now you've

958
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,919
sorted out your storage schema

959
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,440
you need to start thinking about

960
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,200
gathering your results

961
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,919
so i would recommend starting this

962
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:26,640
process by

963
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,039
automating your recon and there are a

964
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,480
few ways to do this

965
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,240
if if you're looking to get your recon

966
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,760
up up and running like

967
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,000
fairly quickly then i'd recommend just

968
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,960
writing wrappers

969
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,519
around existing tools for example you

970
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:40,399
might write a

971
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,600
python wrapper which simply calls the

972
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,120
amass binary

973
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,840
and then processes and stores the the

974
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,200
results okay

975
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,200
so you could then write a separate

976
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,399
python wrapper for

977
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,080
all the other sub domain enumeration

978
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,600
tools like subfinder

979
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,720
uh asset finder or maybe like calling

980
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,720
some api that produces

981
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,760
similar results and you can say you can

982
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,679
use the same concepts like this wrapper

983
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:06,320
concept

984
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,320
for gathering other data for example you

985
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,240
might write a wrapper around

986
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,360
tom nomnom's http probe in order to

987
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,960
determine which of your targets are web

988
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,559
servers right or

989
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,880
you might write a wrapper around nmap or

990
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,600
mass scan

991
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,880
to determine open ports now

992
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,360
writing wrappers in this way can be a

993
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,880
bit dodgy because

994
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,840
you have to process the actual text

995
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,519
that's returned from the tool

996
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,559
so if the tool is updated and the output

997
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,600
is like different in the update then

998
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,000
you might break your automation also

999
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,440
some of the tools that you write

1000
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,159
wrappers for

1001
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:44,480
might not be totally stable or they

1002
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,080
might have some kind of weird quirks

1003
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,600
that you don't notice until you start

1004
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,360
using them at scale

1005
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,320
also the tool might not exactly fit your

1006
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,039
purpose so

1007
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,200
perhaps the output is in a format that

1008
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,039
doesn't really suit your automation or

1009
00:32:59,039 --> 00:32:59,760
that

1010
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,760
or it's missing some key thing that you

1011
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,960
really need in the results

1012
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,799
something like that but i still think

1013
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,399
that writing wrappers in this way

1014
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,240
is a good way to get up and running

1015
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,159
quickly okay

1016
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,640
the alternative of course is to build

1017
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,519
out your own

1018
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,600
tools and and script all of your own

1019
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,360
stuff instead of writing a wrapper

1020
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:17,760
around

1021
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,000
a mass or subfinder or whatever you can

1022
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,440
simply code your own

1023
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,080
subdomain enumeration scripts now this

1024
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,640
can have

1025
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,279
a number of advantages firstly you've

1026
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,360
got full control over the tool

1027
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,600
uh secondly the code that you write can

1028
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,200
fit natively within

1029
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,440
your framework your automation framework

1030
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,200
instead of calling a system process

1031
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,360
right which is way more efficient and

1032
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,399
depending on

1033
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,720
the efficiency of your code this can

1034
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,679
have significant speed advantages too

1035
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,120
yeah also if your automation breaks

1036
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,200
this is a big one if your automation

1037
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,519
breaks you know exactly how to fix it

1038
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,120
and you won't be relying on the

1039
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,679
developer of some third-party tool

1040
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,440
to make changes in order to fix your

1041
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,519
automation right

1042
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,840
the disadvantage to uh writing your own

1043
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,880
stuff of course

1044
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,799
is that you would need to spend a

1045
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,560
significant amount of time

1046
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,520
building out these tools so it might

1047
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,079
just

1048
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,520
not be worth the extra effort for you

1049
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,719
so on to the next step once you've got

1050
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,679
your recon

1051
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,399
automation nailed the next step is and

1052
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:22,960
this is

1053
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,480
this is where a lot of people stop a lot

1054
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,399
of people just automate their recon okay

1055
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,440
but stopping here is in my opinion silly

1056
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,440
okay so once you've got your recon

1057
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,359
automation nailed the next step is to

1058
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:34,480
start automating

1059
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,599
your vulnerability scanning okay and the

1060
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,359
more creative you are in this phase

1061
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,199
the more bugs you will discover

1062
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,520
essentially black box vulnerability

1063
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,440
scanning the way that i think of it is

1064
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,599
basically like sending probes to a

1065
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:48,560
server

1066
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,679
and analyzing the response or responses

1067
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,879
for a specific thing now if that

1068
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,800
specific thing exists

1069
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,119
or um maybe you're looking for something

1070
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,240
that doesn't exist

1071
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,960
but whatever you're looking for you can

1072
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,640
determine from those responses whether

1073
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,400
the server is vulnerable

1074
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,720
and the best server that uh the best

1075
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,079
tool sorry that i've seen

1076
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,040
so far that does this is nuclei from

1077
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,480
project discovery

1078
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,400
i won't go into that in too much depth

1079
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,480
here but if you want to learn more about

1080
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,760
it you can just google

1081
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,800
nuclei project discovery yeah

1082
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,040
and you'll find it i'd i'd highly

1083
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,560
recommend checking this tool out along

1084
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,760
with

1085
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,720
the templates that are in the same

1086
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,640
github account so there's like a nuclei

1087
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,839
templates repository

1088
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,280
and then just a standard nuclear

1089
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,200
repository um

1090
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,960
but you should keep in mind that if

1091
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,640
you're only relying on

1092
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,040
nuclei templates that are in that in

1093
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,160
that repository

1094
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,720
then literally you are actually scanning

1095
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,920
for the same things

1096
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,599
that everyone else is scanning for who

1097
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,040
is using nuclei

1098
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,880
so vulnerability scanning really comes

1099
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,280
into its own when you scan for custom

1100
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:55,839
things

1101
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,640
that you designed yourself right and

1102
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,480
that's where your personal judgment

1103
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,960
and your creativity as a hacker comes

1104
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,720
into play

1105
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,920
now one of the biggest problems that i

1106
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,200
initially faced

1107
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,200
when i was um kind of building out my

1108
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,839
automation was being able to scale out

1109
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,839
to a massive attack surface and still

1110
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,839
scan everything within a reasonable

1111
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,079
amount of time in other words being able

1112
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,480
to scan the entire bugbounty space

1113
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,960
frequently so for example let's say that

1114
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,320
you need to scan

1115
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,119
three and a half million hosts right

1116
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,560
which is a situation that

1117
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,400
that i've been in right um

1118
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,040
so if you scan three and a half million

1119
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,320
hosts and

1120
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,160
let's say you're doing a check for a

1121
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,680
particular vulnerability and it takes

1122
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,240
about

1123
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,720
five seconds okay maybe you need to make

1124
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,640
two or three http requests so

1125
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,040
on average it will take five seconds to

1126
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,160
come back to you

1127
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,320
in this case if you're just using one

1128
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,400
scanner and it's single threaded

1129
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,400
it will take about 200 days yeah

1130
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,800
ideally we don't want it to take that

1131
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,520
long we

1132
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,040
we don't even really want it to take one

1133
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,200
day okay so what options do we have for

1134
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,720
speeding that up

1135
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,400
well firstly you can add threading

1136
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,480
which will dramatically improve your

1137
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,920
speed if you're lucky

1138
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,839
maybe you can run 20 threads at a time

1139
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,040
which might not

1140
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,280
that might knock the scan time down to

1141
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,599
about 10 or 15 days which is

1142
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,079
much much better but it's still not

1143
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,440
ideal

1144
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,839
so firstly that's just too long to wait

1145
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,960
but also it would require a system

1146
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,359
with more resources and eventually if

1147
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:36,880
you keep adding threads

1148
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,560
you're going to run out of resources and

1149
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,400
and it just gets too crazy so if you

1150
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,520
tried to do

1151
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,400
uh those tasks in one day even if you

1152
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,760
had quite a powerful

1153
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,320
vps setup or something like that chances

1154
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,680
are

1155
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,119
you're not going to be able to do it

1156
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,800
right so ultimately

1157
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,960
to progress further than this you're

1158
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,720
going to need to scale out using

1159
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,160
multiple systems

1160
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,000
and there are loads of options for for

1161
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,200
doing something like this

1162
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,160
honestly i haven't experimented with

1163
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,119
most of them

1164
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,880
um i have one that works for me but i

1165
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,400
haven't experimented with most of them

1166
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:08,800
so

1167
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,880
i won't go into this too much but some

1168
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,079
things that you can check out

1169
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,000
are kubernetes uh message brokers like

1170
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,119
redus and rabbit mq are really good but

1171
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,640
also uh there's one that's really up and

1172
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,839
coming at the moment

1173
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,040
and that is axiom by a

1174
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,160
great hacker called pryoc which is p r y

1175
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,599
0 c c so if you search axiom

1176
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,240
prioc github something like that you'll

1177
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,240
definitely find the tool and it's really

1178
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,359
coming into its own

1179
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,520
and um the stuff that products doing

1180
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,880
with that is crazy so i recommend

1181
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,560
checking that out

1182
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,480
anyway once you've got all this sorted

1183
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,760
you've got your recon

1184
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,520
you've got your vulnerability scanning

1185
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,359
you're scaling out with multiple systems

1186
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,359
and and you're able to scan like a very

1187
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,760
large amount of hosts in a single day

1188
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,440
then you're going to have some great

1189
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,200
automation set up and

1190
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,800
you can use that to generate passive

1191
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,760
bounty income and also to prioritize

1192
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,640
which targets

1193
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,280
that you want to deep dive okay so even

1194
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,960
if you're a deep diving hacker

1195
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,960
i'd recommend setting up your automation

1196
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,079
so you're able to

1197
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,839
prioritize the targets that you're deep

1198
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,240
diving

1199
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,280
now i wanted to talk about something

1200
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,040
that i am super passionate about and

1201
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,400
that is collaboration

1202
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,720
and community so bug bounties are at

1203
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,000
this incredible point

1204
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,119
now where there's a really awesome large

1205
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,599
supportive community of people who are

1206
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,040
willing to share information and

1207
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,480
collaborate with one another

1208
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,880
and i personally collaborated very

1209
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,839
heavily with

1210
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:43,359
codingo and prodigy sml or sml 555

1211
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,200
when i was starting out in fact we

1212
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,359
developed our automation out together

1213
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,200
and it was super beneficial for all of

1214
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,200
us we all learnt a lot of stuff

1215
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,359
and i would highly recommend

1216
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,520
collaboration it's worked very very well

1217
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,160
for me

1218
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,720
however there is a caveat you need to

1219
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,560
make sure that your collaboration

1220
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,280
is mutually beneficial and i did very

1221
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,720
well here luckily

1222
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,240
so i i think it's super important to

1223
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,440
agree on the terms of your collaboration

1224
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,760
before you start all parties that are

1225
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,200
involved with the collaboration

1226
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,119
need to be getting equal benefit from

1227
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,119
the collaboration and you need to decide

1228
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,119
what that looks like from the start

1229
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,599
otherwise it's just leeching right

1230
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:24,319
meaning that

1231
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:26,400
it won't be a successful collaboration

1232
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,040
and at least one person will feel used

1233
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,960
so when you collaborate with someone

1234
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,480
make sure that you're very

1235
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,680
upfront from the start about the terms

1236
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,119
of the collaboration

1237
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,440
what will the split be if you make money

1238
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,359
who's responsible for doing what

1239
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,040
how much information are you sharing

1240
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,880
with each other these are all

1241
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,520
important things to consider now i don't

1242
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,119
want to put a dampener on collaboration

1243
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:49,520
because

1244
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,200
it truly is something that's made me

1245
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,880
grow as a hacker immensely

1246
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,319
but i have been very lucky with the

1247
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,000
people that i've collaborated with

1248
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,680
and i've seen other people in

1249
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,000
collaborations where it's just fallen

1250
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,760
apart in a nasty way so

1251
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,920
i think it's best to mitigate the risk

1252
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,960
of that happening

1253
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,280
now as for community i'd recommend

1254
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,880
getting involved with a community

1255
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,440
as much as humanly possible right the

1256
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,040
advantages of doing this are super

1257
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:13,760
obvious

1258
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,319
and abundant so join the conversation on

1259
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:17,040
twitter

1260
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,920
join the bug bounty slack workspaces

1261
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,160
various slack workspaces and discords

1262
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,000
share your successes with people share

1263
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,440
your failures with people

1264
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,680
do write ups share tips and research

1265
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,720
that you're doing

1266
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,960
everything that you share and all of the

1267
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,720
positivity that you spread to others

1268
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,680
will come back to you tenfold i promise

1269
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,960
so the next thing that i wanted to talk

1270
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,800
about is kind of obvious but

1271
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,400
many of the people who message me on

1272
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,319
twitter are missing some fundamental

1273
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:46,880
knowledge

1274
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,560
and it's really holding them back so

1275
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,400
that's what i wanted to talk about

1276
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,720
time for another analogy so suppose your

1277
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,400
bug bouncy knowledge is a big

1278
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,040
tree okay and the larger and older that

1279
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,079
that tree becomes

1280
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,160
the more knowledge you have and each

1281
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,079
leaf on that tree is a piece of

1282
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:03,760
knowledge which grows on another piece

1283
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,440
of knowledge which is a twig

1284
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,680
and each twig grows on a another piece

1285
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,440
of knowledge which is a branch

1286
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,920
and then each branch grows on some core

1287
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,079
hacking knowledge right which is a trunk

1288
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,480
okay so you can't have leaves without

1289
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,119
twigs

1290
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,640
you can't have twigs without branches

1291
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,640
you can't have branches without a trunk

1292
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,440
but then the absolute fundamentals such

1293
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,960
as basic networking

1294
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,079
how http works basic back uc bash

1295
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,400
usage um and how web applications work

1296
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,160
so basically how the internet works

1297
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,800
and stuff like that would be the roots

1298
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,760
of the tree

1299
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,880
now without roots the tree's gonna have

1300
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,560
a lot of trouble growing leaves right

1301
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,160
can you see where i'm going with this

1302
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,160
from what i've seen there are too many

1303
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,680
bug bounty hunters out there that are

1304
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,359
trying to learn the leaves

1305
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,920
without knowing the roots so in order to

1306
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,880
give yourself the best chance of success

1307
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,880
you need to give yourself a grounding in

1308
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,000
the fundamentals

1309
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,839
of how the internet actually works

1310
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,079
before you start learning to hack

1311
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,119
don't try and learn the leaves without

1312
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,920
learning the roots

1313
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,359
so there is another general rule that i

1314
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,040
like to follow when i'm doing bounties

1315
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:11,359
and

1316
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,359
i think that this rule following this

1317
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:14,960
rule has allowed me to find

1318
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,240
way more bugs than i would have

1319
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,760
otherwise and this is the rule it's a

1320
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,800
basic one

1321
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,599
hack where there is less competition

1322
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,480
there are a few

1323
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,599
practical ways to do this okay

1324
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,520
firstly you can hack on programs as soon

1325
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,599
as they open so when a new program opens

1326
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:29,839
up

1327
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,200
jump on it straight away and be the

1328
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,200
first people to be one of the first

1329
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,480
people to hack on it

1330
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,640
this sometimes allow allows you to find

1331
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,680
really easy

1332
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,839
critical bugs if you're quick okay

1333
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:42,079
secondly you can use your automation to

1334
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,599
detect new targets

1335
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:46,400
as they pop up and then focus on them

1336
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,200
straight away

1337
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,240
so it's important to have good

1338
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,079
automation for this one using this

1339
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:51,920
method will ensure that you are the

1340
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,400
first or if not one of the first hackers

1341
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,920
to be looking at it which which is a

1342
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,359
huge advantage okay

1343
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:58,720
and think about this what's the

1344
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,240
likelihood that someone else has got

1345
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,040
automation

1346
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,200
which managed to discover this host uh

1347
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,319
before you did

1348
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,720
and then they've actually decided to act

1349
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,160
on that and jump on

1350
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,079
and start hacking on it straight away

1351
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,599
basically zero so there's a good chance

1352
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,040
that you'll be the first person if you

1353
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,480
use that method

1354
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,040
and thirdly you can detect changes in

1355
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,079
your existing

1356
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,400
targets using your automation so for

1357
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,119
example

1358
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,920
if a dns record changes on a subdomain

1359
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,800
check

1360
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,599
that out because it it might be pointing

1361
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,440
to a new website it might be a subdomain

1362
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,480
takeover

1363
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,880
or it might just like have some like new

1364
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,640
admin panel that's not supposed to be

1365
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,040
exposed externally something like that

1366
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,440
and if an application has a significant

1367
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,160
change for example if the http response

1368
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:42,880
size is

1369
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,640
significantly different to the last time

1370
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,119
you saw it or the html titles changed or

1371
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,000
something like that

1372
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,040
check it out fourthly you can run a web

1373
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:52,560
crawler such as burp

1374
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,800
or hack ruler against an application

1375
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,319
regularly with the same settings every

1376
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:56,960
time

1377
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,119
and then you'll be able to know if a new

1378
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:00,079
endpoint suddenly

1379
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,240
appears and if a new endpoint appears

1380
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,440
you've got to check that out right

1381
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,720
because you'll definitely be the first

1382
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,240
person checking that out there's there's

1383
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,839
basically no one doing that as far as i

1384
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:08,640
know

1385
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,720
of course there are loads of other ways

1386
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,319
that you can find targets with less

1387
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,119
competition

1388
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:14,960
but hopefully that gives you some ideas

1389
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,160
to start remember

1390
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,319
creativity is key if you can think of

1391
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:20,079
more ways implement those into your

1392
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:20,880
automation

1393
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,839
and start doing it

1394
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,400
and we are almost out of time but i

1395
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,560
saved the best thing for last okay so

1396
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,160
if you just take one thing from this

1397
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,319
whole talk i hope that it's this

1398
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:35,920
in order to be successful in bug

1399
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,839
bounties you need to be super switched

1400
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:38,240
on

1401
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,200
and creative which requires that you

1402
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,240
have a brain

1403
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,880
that is well nourished and awake and

1404
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,560
this means that it's going to be

1405
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,960
way way easier for you to succeed at bug

1406
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,280
bounties if you're eating good food

1407
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,680
and exercising regularly and sleeping

1408
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,960
enough just generally

1409
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,280
looking after yourself and i really want

1410
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,079
to encourage

1411
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,000
everyone to put their health before

1412
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
anything else and the best thing is

1413
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,280
this won't just make it easier to

1414
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,119
succeed at bounties it will just help

1415
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,960
you in general to live a more

1416
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,160
fulfilling life but staying inspired

1417
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,000
and excited about life and like being

1418
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,160
able to focus and discipline your time

1419
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:14,800
like with

1420
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,359
bug bounties it requires more than just

1421
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:18,240
being healthy

1422
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,480
okay healthy is a baseline you don't

1423
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,599
want to just be healthy

1424
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,520
you want to be at your peak and this

1425
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,839
requires constant personal growth

1426
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:28,800
now i attribute a lot of my success not

1427
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,920
just bounties but

1428
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,920
everything to the time and effort that i

1429
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,920
invest in improving myself by reading

1430
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,119
inspiring books

1431
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,119
meditating listening to podcasts and

1432
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:38,960
just generally being

1433
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,440
creative and inspired in disciplines

1434
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,839
outside of computers right

1435
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:45,680
personal growth is something that all

1436
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,079
humans i think naturally desire

1437
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,319
but it's also something that many of us

1438
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:51,520
never fully

1439
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,640
embrace or bring into our lives

1440
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,040
and since i have fully like embraced

1441
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,480
personal growth

1442
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,480
i feel like my life is just booming

1443
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,680
since then right

1444
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,520
so i want to encourage everyone to

1445
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,359
embrace self-growth and bring that into

1446
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:06,079
their lives

1447
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:08,160
i want to encourage all of you to be the

1448
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,160
best people that you can possibly

1449
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,680
be and on that note best of luck

1450
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,520
being the best human that you can be and

1451
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,280
also good luck with all of your bug

1452

best and thanks for watching my talk

1467
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:57,389
[Music]

1468
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,160
that was awesome yeah

1469
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,359
um love the uh love the talk there's

1470
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:07,680
just

1471
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,359
so many questions now that we have to

1472
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:11,680
work out where to start so i guess

1473
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,520
off the top one of the one of the key

1474
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,200
things to kind of cover here

1475
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,119
burnout how do you deal with it if

1476
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:19,119
you're going to be doing this

1477
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:22,000
daily as shown is the better way to kind

1478
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:22,800
of approach this

1479
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,800
how are you balancing that with burnout

1480
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,240
ah yeah so this question gets asked so

1481
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:30,640
much

1482
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,000
and um uh to to everyone i i think

1483
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,079
like if you watch like nam sex stream

1484
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,680
and things like that nonsense

1485
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,920
asks it to everyone that comes on the

1486
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:40,720
stream

1487
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,839
um for me it's not about uh

1488
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:45,599
recovering from burnout some people ask

1489
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:47,440
a question like this they say

1490
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,160
um how do i get over burnout and then

1491
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,040
other people say

1492
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,359
how do i avoid burnout so i think like

1493
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:55,200
90 of the struggle is avoiding it in the

1494
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,160
first place

1495
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,559
and um you can do that by not hacking

1496
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:00,079
too much like

1497
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,680
it's something that you love and it's

1498
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,119
easy to do a lot

1499
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,520
at the start but you need to make sure

1500
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,040
that you're approaching

1501
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,119
hacking and bug bounties from from a

1502
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,359
point where like you don't necessarily

1503
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:14,800
need that you don't need to do that

1504
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,520
to like survive or whatever so something

1505
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,200
that has happened to me in the past is

1506
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:19,920
is i've had

1507
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,960
people message me and say hey um you

1508
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,280
know

1509
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,520
i don't have a job and my family is

1510
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,720
relying on me being

1511
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,440
um successful in bug bounties or earning

1512
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,720
bounties this month

1513
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,640
to like um to pay for my family's

1514
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,440
living expenses or whatever and i'm like

1515
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,640
what

1516
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,720
like you can't you can't put yourself in

1517
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,480
that position unless you're 100

1518
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,480
sure that you're already going to be

1519
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,319
able to do that on your ear so like

1520
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,319
that's one thing is like trying trying

1521
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,160
to like position your life in a way

1522
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:50,960
where

1523
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,359
you are not relying on that income or

1524
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:54,000
you're not

1525
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,800
absolutely forced to be doing that 100

1526
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,240
of the time

1527
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,359
um so there's that but you know

1528
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:04,400
if if you are feeling burnt out or you

1529
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,200
kind of um you know you have overdone it

1530
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,800
which i definitely have in the past

1531
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,839
multiple times um you need to just step

1532
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:12,400
back

1533
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,880
um i find that you know some people say

1534
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,800
i play video games when i feel burnt out

1535
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,160
that doesn't work for me because i'm

1536
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,760
still sitting in front of a screen like

1537
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,720
physically

1538
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,240
i'm doing the same thing right i'm

1539
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,240
sitting in front of a screen um

1540
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,160
but things that work for me are just

1541
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,920
getting out of the house

1542
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,640
um just like not thinking about hacking

1543
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,559
for a while just resetting my brain to a

1544
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:33,440
point where

1545
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,440
i'm not constantly thinking about bug

1546
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,720
bounties or some like

1547
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,400
bug bounty puzzle that i'm solving or

1548
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,559
whatever but like getting outside

1549
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:41,760
getting in nature

1550
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,720
going to the beach going for a bush walk

1551
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,200
um

1552
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,800
you know spending time with my family

1553
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,040
obviously playing music

1554
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,839
uh things like that so that's that's

1555
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:52,640
basically

1556
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,359
how i deal with burnout but the other

1557
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,960
thing is is the one that i touched on in

1558
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:57,440
the talk

1559
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,559
and and that is like it's better to pace

1560
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:01,119
yourself

1561
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:04,000
and to do little and often than it is to

1562
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:04,559
um

1563
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:07,680
do big chunks so if you kind of

1564
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,000
if you commit to doing one hour a day

1565
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,359
five days a week

1566
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:14,400
you are going to probably end up doing

1567
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,160
more hours over a long stretch than

1568
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,440
someone who commits to doing

1569
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,760
10 hours a day every day right because

1570
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,200
if you're doing 10 hours a day every day

1571
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,680
how long can you realistically keep that

1572
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,240
up

1573
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,160
versus if you're doing one hour a day

1574
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,160
five days a week you've got two days off

1575
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,359
and you're only spending one hour a day

1576
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:30,559
the other five days so

1577
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,240
that's like quite an achievable

1578
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,920
sustainable thing that you can keep up

1579
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,880
for a long time

1580
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,000
and i'm about to start reading a book i

1581
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,359
haven't started reading it yet but i

1582
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:39,760
think

1583
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,200
that's what it's about and it's called

1584
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,839
atomic habits so i'll definitely let you

1585
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:44,880
know how

1586
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,240
that goes after i've read it

1587
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,800
so i guess uh follow up from that so one

1588
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,680
thing that i love

1589
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,880
like we've known each other for a few

1590
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,160
years and one thing that we've often

1591
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:54,960
done

1592
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,440
is liken bounties to other communities

1593
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,160
so

1594
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,160
um i used to play poker for a living so

1595
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,400
i'll refer the evolution to that and

1596
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,319
used to be a musician so you'll refer it

1597
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:06,319
to that and i think we can both agree

1598
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:07,920
that both of those communities have

1599
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:08,880
established

1600
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,760
you don't go doing this for a living

1601
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,319
until

1602
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:14,319
so for poker if you didn't have a year's

1603
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:16,079
worth of savings you were crazy to try

1604
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:17,760
and become a professional poker player

1605
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,280
you just wouldn't do it and music as

1606
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,040
well like you need established gigs and

1607
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,960
you don't just jump in and do it

1608
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,440
so in the bounty space what would you

1609
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,599
say is the definition that we don't

1610
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,760
have yet but how would you know when

1611
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,160
you're ready to go from being sort of

1612
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,359
your side hustle

1613
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,480
to a full-time bounty person

1614
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,400
well actually michael i remember having

1615
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,000
this conversation with you when we were

1616
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,520
thinking about it ourselves

1617
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,839
because there was a point yeah before

1618
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:45,760
before we worked for bug crowd where we

1619
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:46,000
were

1620
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,920
getting pretty successful in the bounty

1621
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,920
and we're collaborating a lot on that

1622
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,119
and um also with sajeeb shout out to

1623
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,520
sml555 he's not here right now but

1624
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,640
um shout out to him because we'll

1625
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,800
probably see it later but you know

1626
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,280
um i remember for me at the time i was

1627
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,480
like

1628
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,200
um i want to earn i won't say the amount

1629
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,359
but i want to earn this much money as my

1630
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:08,640
yearly salary

1631
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,040
and if i can earn an amount every month

1632
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,040
for six months running

1633
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,640
that that would make up that salary

1634
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,720
consistently over that whole six months

1635
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,000
then i'll quit my job

1636
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,480
and that was my goal and um you know

1637
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,599
what we

1638
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:26,160
i actually we did achieve that goal but

1639
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,119
by then we had

1640
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:28,559
uh we were working we were both working

1641
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:32,480
for pug crowds so now we're like

1642
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,079
we noticed you were doing that and

1643
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,559
started offering jobs and i think that's

1644
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:38,880
that's a testament to like there's

1645
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,640
multiple ways in security to be

1646
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,280
successful

1647
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,079
you know yeah there's there's you know

1648
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:45,280
we love what we do

1649
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,559
and it feels it feels like fun i mean

1650
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,800
we enjoy it and and you don't have to be

1651
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,319
full-time bounties for that i think

1652
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:54,079
that's a it's a super important like

1653
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:55,520
those there was two bits you know when

1654
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,200
you when you busted out the spreadsheet

1655
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,960
in that talk look it's like uh what's he

1656
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,480
doing but it's

1657
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,520
it's really key i think to

1658
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,920
you know do the fundamentals in terms of

1659
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,000
just understanding like what is what is

1660
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,400
your personal burn rate what is what's

1661
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,839
what does a budget look like for your

1662
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:13,520
household you know

1663
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,520
like actually approaching the whole

1664
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:16,880
thing rationally

1665
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,559
there's a lot of excitement there's like

1666
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,240
that game mechanic there's the dopamine

1667
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,000
hit of getting a bug and like how good

1668
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,319
that feels like all that sort of stuff

1669
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:26,240
and like those are all good things but

1670
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,319
if they if they cause you to act

1671
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:29,839
irrationally you can end up in a

1672
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:31,040
position where you're under a fair bit

1673
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,559
of duress

1674
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:33,680
which is not something that you want to

1675
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,359
you know you want to avoid that if you

1676
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:36,000
can

1677
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,079
and i will say like personal finances

1678
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,200
are super important

1679
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:42,000
and um this is something that like my

1680
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,160
wife is meticulous in in our budgeting

1681
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:44,880
like she

1682
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,200
she adds up uh everything we know

1683
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,640
exactly what we've got to spend in these

1684
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,319
different areas we're saving for our car

1685
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:51,680
insurance as soon as we pay it we're

1686
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,440
saving for the whole year month or month

1687
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,920
like little things like that so when we

1688
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,440
take risks

1689
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,839
um we know the risk that we're taking

1690
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,960
and when we spend money

1691
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,720
on something we know exactly what we're

1692
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,160
spending and we know that we can or

1693
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,200
can't afford it

1694
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,960
you know so i'm not saying that we still

1695
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,119
make we make good decisions but at least

1696
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:10,559
when we make bad decisions we know

1697
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,720
exactly how bad the decision is

1698
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,880
and and i think that's important and if

1699
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,160
you're thinking about quitting your job

1700
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,839
and saying bug bounces full time like

1701
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:18,319
you

1702
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:19,760
better know what you're doing you know

1703
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,440
what i mean you you

1704
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,920
want to be very sure that you can live

1705
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,440
off that salary and i and

1706
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,440
i don't want to discourage it because a

1707
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,640
lot of people have done it very

1708
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:29,839
successfully

1709
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:32,799
but um yeah you you've got to know

1710
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:33,839
you've got to know what you're doing

1711
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:36,319
basically

1712
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,599
yeah definitely i think it's you know

1713
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:41,280
that's the next phase of discussion in

1714
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,640
valley like i've watched you

1715
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,880
successfully predict a lot of the bounty

1716
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,480
space a couple years ago

1717
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,319
luke was like oh youtube's the next wave

1718
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:50,000
and he's like oh it'll be streaming and

1719
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,200
we're just hitting that phase

1720
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,520
and then automation we were all in quite

1721
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,520
a lot like that's the next phase

1722
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,040
and you know i think we're just hitting

1723
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,799
that phase now we're starting the mental

1724
00:55:58,799 --> 00:55:59,680
side of things

1725
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,240
being that active discussion and it's

1726
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:02,880
still not

1727
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,400
quite here yet a lot of people are

1728
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,799
taking risks that i think are

1729
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:08,960
probably too far on the on that you know

1730
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,480
just jump and hope for the best

1731
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,000
or as case would put it yet just go

1732
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,799
and it's good yeah like these talks are

1733
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:18,000
great because that that starts to

1734
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,440
establish that conversation that needs

1735
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:19,920
to be

1736
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,480
reinforced and happening well i think i

1737
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,520
mean i'll

1738
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,880
i'll just add to that before we go into

1739
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,480
another question as well just going off

1740
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,400
the uh the last talk like

1741
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,760
when um when i stepped out of working

1742
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,480
full-time

1743
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:33,839
into full-time entrepreneurship it

1744
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:35,760
wasn't just cut the whole thing off and

1745
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:36,400
jump in

1746
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,720
like i'd built up the ability to do

1747
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,079
consulting work

1748
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:43,040
to basically backfill my income as i

1749
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,799
started to work on the riskier stuff so

1750
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,480
it looks from the outside in as this

1751
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,599
like

1752
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:50,559
crazy heroic you know not very rational

1753
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:52,160
decision to jump into

1754
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,680
trying to do startups but there's a lot

1755
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,040
of there's a lot of planning and a lot

1756
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,640
of thought that went into it and i think

1757
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,880
that's part of why it's been successful

1758
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,040
um because the same thing applies to

1759
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,400
most people that do that type of thing

1760
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,280
including

1761
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,880
going into full-time bounty hunting it's

1762
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,880
not just like screw it let's just go

1763
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,040
and see what happens it's actually

1764
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,559
building it up and actually being in a

1765
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:11,680
position where

1766
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,280
you know you're not going to completely

1767
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,640
like you want to be uncomfortable enough

1768
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,079
for it to push you along but you don't

1769
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:17,280
want to be so uncomfortable that you're

1770
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:17,920
so stressed

1771
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,839
you just end up burning out like i think

1772
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:21,599
it's it's that kind of balancing act you

1773
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:22,000
want to

1774
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,359
want to be able to do the math on yeah

1775
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,440
so absolutely

1776
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,920
sorry uh so you've also released quite a

1777
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,520
number of tools recently for example

1778
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,799
hack crawler and

1779
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:34,799
uh there's quite a number that have that

1780
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:36,079
you've released how

1781
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:38,079
what sort of what sort of process would

1782
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:40,160
you use to maybe automate something like

1783
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,559
something like that and and how's the

1784
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:43,440
how is the

1785
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,559
the community actually um

1786
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,079
assisted with the development of those

1787
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:50,160
tools the community part of that

1788
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,359
i think is probably one of the more

1789
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,359
important things that we probably need

1790
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:55,839
to touch on as well

1791
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:59,280
yeah so um i feel like

1792
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,040
the infosec community ha sometimes has a

1793
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,200
reputation for being a bit harsh

1794
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,280
um but it's really weird it's like

1795
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,040
sometimes harsh and it's sometimes the

1796
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,960
most loving supportive amazing community

1797
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:11,599
ever

1798
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:13,680
so it just depends on who you run into i

1799
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:14,880
think and

1800
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:18,720
um you know when it comes to releasing

1801
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,920
tools

1802
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,400
i compared a lot to releasing music from

1803
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,599
when i was a musician you feel like

1804
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:24,640
you're really putting yourself

1805
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,280
out there and you feel like you are

1806
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,280
really putting yourself out there for

1807
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,160
judgment right so you release a tool and

1808
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:32,960
then

1809
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,559
you're just scared that like you're

1810
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:36,079
gonna get a bunch of negative feedback

1811
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,599
from that and destroy your reputation

1812
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:39,119
because you're like you know you coded

1813
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:40,400
something wrong or whatever

1814
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,880
but um it's all fair you know that

1815
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,160
that's just fear and

1816
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,400
i think um overcoming that and releasing

1817
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,760
tools um

1818
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,960
is super important and it helps the

1819
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,319
whole community to grow

1820
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:55,359
so i've kind of gotten into the habit of

1821
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:57,839
um well i realized that i'd written a

1822
00:58:57,839 --> 00:58:59,599
lot of stuff for myself

1823
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:01,680
that wasn't necessarily what i

1824
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,720
considered to be

1825
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:05,040
release quality and like from working as

1826
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,640
a developer previously

1827
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,880
and working in um you know application

1828
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,799
security at banks and stuff

1829
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:13,280
like i had this kind of um what's the

1830
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,160
word

1831
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:18,000
this idea of something being production

1832
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,839
ready and release quality as being like

1833
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:21,520
absolute perfection

1834
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,200
and um when we're talking about hacking

1835
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,799
tools like it's just not the case

1836
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,720
like you don't have a development team

1837
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,160
you don't have a qa team

1838
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,000
you don't have like a full-on devops

1839
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,200
life cycle unless you're

1840
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,920
unless you know crazy um just for your

1841
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,680
hacking tools so i think it's important

1842
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:36,799
to just like

1843
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:39,599
when you feel like you're kind of ready

1844
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:40,960
you know you have tools at like an

1845
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,359
okay level it's okay to release stuff

1846
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:44,480
and call it a beta

1847
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,400
and ask for community support because

1848
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,319
you're open sourcing your tools

1849
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:51,440
and you are giving to the community

1850
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,640
and um you know just own it and and

1851
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,240
if someone's like oh this tool sucks

1852
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,000
then then ignore them

1853
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,359
and um just um you know know that you're

1854
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:02,960
doing it for the community and and know

1855
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:03,440
that

1856
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,119
it's not just your responsibility like

1857
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:07,200
you're giving away something for free

1858
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,240
so if you're asking for people's um

1859
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,240
what's you know pull requests and and

1860
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,680
you know tool updates and things like

1861
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:14,240
that

1862
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,760
people to help you doing that that's

1863
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,240
fine like like absolutely do that

1864
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,559
and um you know releasing stuff on

1865
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:22,160
github is

1866
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,880
is amazing i i really enjoy doing it and

1867
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,480
i've got some public repositories up

1868
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,480
there that are so not production ready

1869
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,000
and even hack crawler when i release

1870
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,599
tack crawler it didn't really work very

1871
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:32,240
well

1872
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,680
and it's slowly getting more and more

1873
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,280
stable and and um

1874
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,799
you know i feel like it's kind of stable

1875
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,960
now it's but it's definitely more stable

1876
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,799
but um there are still some features in

1877
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:42,400
there that i want to implement that's

1878
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,760
still on there and i'm kind of hoping

1879
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,440
someone else will do it because i'm

1880
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,920
sure short on time but you know that's

1881
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:48,640
fine and

1882
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:51,119
um and a lot of people are using how

1883
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:53,440
cooler now and it's it's great you know

1884
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:57,440
so it's the same mentality as your talk

1885
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,119
right where you're saying just start

1886
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:01,680
it's just release and i'm i'm terrible

1887
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,839
at this i don't take my own advice but

1888
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:05,680
the main mistake people do is over

1889
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,359
polish and and worry too much about what

1890
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:08,559
the community thinks before putting it

1891
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:09,520
out there

1892
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:10,720
and once you release and you start

1893
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,880
collaborating yeah yeah

1894
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:16,160
yeah that's that's what

1895
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,599
i just said that that causes you to

1896
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:19,040
never release because you're waiting for

1897
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:19,680
that perfect

1898
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,240
yeah yeah fast fast dns that's where

1899
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,359
this is where this is where

1900
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:24,240
collaboration

1901
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,640
is is so i think it's so powerful as

1902
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:27,680
well because you can end up in a

1903
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:28,720
position where it's like okay i'm

1904
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:29,680
releasing this thing

1905
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:33,280
look you know it's alpha um

1906
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,960
that's being generous but here's some

1907
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,480
friends that i've been working

1908
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,680
with it on like you know on on it with

1909
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,920
um and all of a sudden you're getting

1910
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,680
like you're not misrepresenting it super

1911
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:44,960
polished you've got other people that

1912
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,319
understand what you're trying to achieve

1913
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:47,839
and know how to like support you and

1914
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:49,520
driving that whole thing forward so all

1915
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:50,559
of a sudden you're not

1916
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:52,000
kind of just sticking your neck out on

1917
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,119
your own i think that's a really

1918
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:55,119
important component to it

1919
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:58,640
i mean that's that's where sorry

1920
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,880
i like when you look at a lot of the

1921
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,000
major like

1922
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,599
really kind of popular hacking tools

1923
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:04,960
that have come out recently that

1924
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:05,599
actually

1925
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:06,960
groups that are releasing them and

1926
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,799
project discovery is one of those groups

1927
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:09,599
you know

1928
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:12,480
um you know really they they took sub

1929
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,440
finder which was

1930
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,440
already an existing tool um that

1931
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,960
actually kaninga was part of

1932
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,559
and they kind of revamped it and

1933
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:20,319
re-released it and it's the same with a

1934
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:21,599
lot of the tools that they're doing but

1935
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:22,559
it's a group

1936
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:23,920
so if you're working as a group i

1937
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,839
suppose you have less some fear about

1938
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:27,359
your own reputation and things like that

1939
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:29,440
it's more of a collaborative effort

1940
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,839
yeah and i think to click on there too i

1941
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:33,359
mean you don't have to be a security

1942
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:34,000
professional yet

1943
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,039
involved like subfinder originally was

1944
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:39,119
iceman and myself and then kent gruber

1945
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:40,000
joined the project

1946
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,920
and just brought this professionalism to

1947
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,319
it from his development background

1948
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:47,200
that really took it to that ex next

1949
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,079
height

1950
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:50,000
and i think that's often the case that

1951
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,440
you can put it out there with

1952
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,039
you know your intention behind it and

1953
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:54,960
someone will see a better way of

1954
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,319
approaching it and if you can work

1955
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:57,760
together it becomes a really powerful

1956
01:02:57,760 --> 01:02:58,480
thing

1957
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:01,200
yeah definitely definitely same thing

1958
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,480
happened with hack crawler when i

1959
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,359
released it

1960
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:04,559
there are like three or four pull

1961
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:06,480
requests that basically like

1962
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,160
revamped the whole tool put more

1963
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,480
features in um change the code up

1964
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,039
and you know people people message me

1965
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,160
sometimes and they're like thanks for

1966
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,039
hack crawler

1967
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:17,599
and i say don't just thank me there's

1968
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:18,160
like

1969
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,559
10 contributors you know that have gone

1970
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:22,000
into that say

1971
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,400
it's you know yeah agreed

1972
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:30,240
yeah uh someone asked

1973
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,119
is akamy subdomain takeover possible i

1974
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,960
don't think it is but

1975
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,880
it could be wrong subdomain takeovers

1976
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,559
are one of those things where like

1977
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:40,480
even that even that repository that

1978
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,799
that's up that's like uh

1979
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:45,119
um what's it called can i take over xyz

1980
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:47,039
together yeah

1981
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:50,480
i'll touch base on like i'm i'm one of

1982
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,559
the main contributors with that overflow

1983
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:54,880
the it's reached a stage where like i

1984
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,559
can't contribute anymore because i work

1985
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:58,240
in a triage team so it's the wrong thing

1986
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,280
for me to do

1987
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,280
and ed overflow has broader visions for

1988
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,880
the project that means that that one

1989
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,039
um doesn't move as much so i think

1990
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:06,480
there's an important lesson there that

1991
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,920
if you just use that

1992
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,680
as your reference point you're missing

1993
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,359
so much and one of the most valuable

1994
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:12,000
things that

1995
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,799
luke sajib and i did about a year ago is

1996
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:15,440
we flew

1997
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:17,839
sajeeb up we got into luke's apartment

1998
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:20,079
and we just mapped out every single

1999
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:21,520
service we could and then started

2000
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,680
testing in a spreadsheet and

2001
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,760
that kind of research is what leads you

2002
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,079
to new findings in new areas because if

2003
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:29,440
you're doing that and 90

2004
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,880
of people are using the can i take over

2005
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,799
list 90 of people are missing things

2006
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:33,839
that you're going to find

2007
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:35,359
or some of them are flat out wrong these

2008
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:37,039
days because the state has changed

2009
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:39,839
yeah so actually there's a tip there's a

2010
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:41,599
tip in that there's a hot hashtag bug

2011
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:42,799
bouncy tip in that

2012
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:45,119
so the way what we actually did was we

2013
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:47,280
got all of our recon data together

2014
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,640
and then we got the c names of every yes

2015
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,039
in every domain and then we checked all

2016
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:54,720
of those c names to find which ones were

2017
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,000
attached to services

2018
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,839
and then we got a stack of sub domain

2019
01:04:57,839 --> 01:04:59,359
takeovers on really

2020
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:01,920
really obscure services that that like

2021
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,760
we didn't know existed so

2022
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,160
um instead of starting from like okay

2023
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,960
what services exist we actually had that

2024
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,640
and then and then we tried to take over

2025
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,160
them from from there so

2026
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,160
yeah and to kind of touch it like this

2027
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,240
was some of these were

2028
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,640
spun into entire programming projects

2029
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,000
you don't just stop it

2030
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,920
oh yes no this move to the next one some

2031
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,200
of them we were like i think there's

2032
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,160
something there

2033
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,359
and there's a project that luke and

2034
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:27,119
sadie did off the back of that for a

2035
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:28,960
service that just took them

2036
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,640
way down a rabbit hole to finding

2037
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,240
something that just

2038
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,319
paid incredible dividends because no one

2039
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:36,240
was looking at it the right way

2040
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,240
um and that's you know that's there's so

2041
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,720
much of that in the bounty space that

2042
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,039
you see like even in in our own discord

2043
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:44,559
some people go oh i just don't feel like

2044
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:44,960
there's

2045
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,200
anything to be there to be found i mean

2046
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,200
we still see stuff popping up in public

2047
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,000
programs because

2048
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,520
the state changes all the knowledge

2049
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,359
changes what we know today we may not

2050
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:54,480
know tomorrow i mean

2051
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:55,599
there's a point where people didn't

2052
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:57,520
understand sql injection right there's a

2053
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,839
point where people didn't understand xss

2054
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:02,079
and there's going to be new stuff that

2055
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:03,280
comes out maybe not whole new

2056
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,200
vulnerabilities but new ways of thinking

2057
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,200
that allows you to find things that

2058
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,319
people haven't seen before

2059
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:14,079
absolutely yeah so i have i have a

2060
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:15,680
question for you luke

2061
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,839
how do you avoid forgetting to turn off

2062
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:20,240
your vpss and running up your digital

2063
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,400
ocean build to

2064
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,559
the point that it announced any earning

2065
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:26,240
that you've made from anything

2066
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:30,160
ever so there's two there's two things

2067
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:30,559
there

2068
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:32,559
um the first thing is my automation

2069
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:34,640
never sleeps so i never have any reason

2070
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,400
to turn a vps off

2071
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,440
um and uh

2072
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:42,640
that's uh so so earn more is your

2073
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:46,240
your solution to that problem nice okay

2074
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,799
you should be paying for your your uh

2075
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:51,039
vps and then some and if it's not then

2076
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:52,000
turn it off

2077
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,280
but um there's that and uh

2078
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,680
also check out axiom the project by

2079
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,200
pryoc where you can start

2080
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:03,359
up digitalocean vpss on a timer so they

2081
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:04,240
just kill themselves

2082
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:07,039
after however long you set so yeah

2083
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:07,680
there's that

2084
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:10,960
nice and also you can just spin them up

2085
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,319
and then at the end of the month when

2086
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:13,680
you get the bill you can remember that

2087
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,760
and then turn it off

2088
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,440
or you can get a whopping big cloud

2089
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,440
service because you forgot to turn stuff

2090
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,240
off

2091
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,799
being there situation's not so bad but

2092
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:24,319
sometimes with aws stuff

2093
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:26,720
i just like even even when i get the

2094
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:27,920
bill i'm like i don't even know what

2095
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:28,720
that is

2096
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:29,920
and then i have to like search through

2097
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,440
the console for an hour trying to find

2098
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,400
what i left on you know

2099
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,400
i think goggle's really good for digital

2100
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,240
ocean as well

2101
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,640
which i guess bug bounty tip if you can

2102
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,319
figure out if a server has been

2103
01:07:42,319 --> 01:07:43,839
a kami band and have an image in

2104
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:45,440
digitalocean you could spin up a new

2105
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:46,799
instance and doctor and get a new ip

2106
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:47,280
address

2107
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:49,520
so there's some some useful things

2108
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,359
around that that i think a lot of people

2109
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:52,960
aren't doing and their automation gets

2110
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:54,319
hampered because they're not

2111
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:57,359
seeing those pieces and uh a lot of that

2112
01:07:57,359 --> 01:07:59,119
still to be explored

2113
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:00,880
yeah you could you could automate around

2114
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,240
this um too

2115
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,160
like kind of like what you touched on

2116
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,599
like aws

2117
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:07,119
and digitalocean both have really

2118
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:08,960
comprehensive apis

2119
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,119
so if you did want to learn how if you

2120
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:12,400
did want to remember to turn something

2121
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,599
off you could literally

2122
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:15,039
code something up to send your message

2123
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:17,040
every day saying these are the instances

2124
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,799
you've got currently got running

2125
01:08:18,799 --> 01:08:21,679
yeah are you sure yeah yeah yeah that'd

2126
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:23,120
be cool you know i imagine i mean you

2127
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:23,359
know

2128
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:25,359
i keep on referring to uh to digital

2129
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:26,960
ocean here but it's the same for any

2130
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:29,439
any cloud provider it's the one that i

2131
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,040
use most often but yeah

2132
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,120
that whole idea of you know management

2133
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,439
of all these resources especially

2134
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:37,359
i've seen it i guess the reason i asked

2135
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:39,198
that question is that i've tripped over

2136
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:40,719
that particular problem you know more

2137
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:42,479
than once um

2138
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:44,640
in context to bug crowd and in context

2139
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,399
of just doing my own research on the

2140
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:47,198
side but

2141
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:48,719
i don't think i've met anyone who hasn't

2142
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:51,198
been accidentally alarmed by a build

2143
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:52,640
they've gotten from a cloud provider at

2144
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:53,600
some point

2145
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,600
so it's sort of like for the for the for

2146
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,238
the newest uh amongst this um

2147
01:08:58,238 --> 01:09:00,799
you know how to think ahead on that one

2148
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:02,000
yeah i think that's also

2149
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,399
when not enterprise like in an

2150
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:05,759
enterprise that's that stuff's planned

2151
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:06,158
for

2152
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:07,439
you know what you're doing from the

2153
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:09,759
outset bounty it's like

2154
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:13,679
vps go and then you realize the impact

2155
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:16,158
uh yeah i i just got i just wanted to

2156
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:18,238
touch on this thing because ah quite or

2157
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:21,520
um andy just recently uh

2158
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:23,279
just put this in the discord and he said

2159
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:24,880
um i'll read it directly

2160
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,238
i want to poke that question answer

2161
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:27,759
around bounty earnings and automation

2162
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:29,359
and being able to turn them off

2163
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:30,880
i think there's an element of economic

2164
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,000
privilege there that we need to

2165
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,520
acknowledge where someone who's short on

2166
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:34,000
resources

2167
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,279
and just starting out can't have that

2168
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:37,439
power and i totally agree

2169
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:40,960
i totally agree um when i

2170
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:44,560
started bug bounties i was not saving

2171
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:45,120
any money

2172
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,040
and i didn't spend any money on bug

2173
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,120
bounties so the only money that i've

2174
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,799
ever spent on bug bounties

2175
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:52,640
has been money that i have earned from

2176
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,560
bug bounties so initially

2177
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,080
my automation was running on my home

2178
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,080
internet with um on my

2179
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,760
on my laptop and i just had to like

2180
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,440
leave it on and change my power settings

2181
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,280
to like stay on overnight

2182
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,120
and then you know i got a few bounties

2183
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,440
and i kind of reinvested that into

2184
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:10,159
um you know digital ocean and everything

2185
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:10,560
um

2186
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,719
and then as you kind of start being more

2187
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:14,320
successful finding more bugs you can

2188
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,320
keep reinvesting reinvesting

2189
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:17,600
treatment i mean i kind of treat

2190
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,600
automation like an investment right

2191
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,960
and the day that my automation starts

2192
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,960
stops earning as much as i'm paying for

2193
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,040
it i would downscale that automation

2194
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,360
or just stop it entirely and i totally

2195
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:30,880
totally acknowledge that

2196
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,640
um you know economic privilege is

2197
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,320
definitely a thing so i don't mean to

2198
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,360
come across that way

2199
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,000
but yeah it's it's worth calling out

2200
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,600
that digitalocean has the 100

2201
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,560
100 voucher for your first month i think

2202
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:43,920
i can't remember exactly what it is but

2203
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,120
there's definitely a free proof point

2204
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,640
there to start out as well

2205
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,719
um you can google that and find

2206
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:50,480
affiliate codes everywhere

2207
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,440
um essentially they'll give you a

2208
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,640
month's worth of credit

2209
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,320
you can go nuts on that and use that as

2210
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:58,480
your earning point if you're starting to

2211
01:10:58,480 --> 01:10:59,280
to build out

2212
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,679
so yeah and andrew mohawk on discord

2213
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:03,520
just pointed out to you that um

2214
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:06,159
aws has a free tier so you can you can

2215
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:06,800
definitely

2216
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,560
yeah yeah that's a good point

2217
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,840
and azure and gcp i think as well i

2218
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,120
think they've all got some sort of

2219
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,880
some sort of entry level tier that that

2220
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,239
most people can get a bit of a basic

2221
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:19,199
start on

2222
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:21,600
um just don't go don't go crazy on on

2223
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:22,800
some of those because then you will end

2224
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,520
up with a bill pretty quickly

2225
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,560
yeah yeah um so what how

2226
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,880
what sort of so obviously it's your talk

2227
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,400
touched on automation and you need to

2228
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,159
know some sort of coding

2229
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:37,199
skill to to to start that what what sort

2230
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:38,880
of things should people look at starting

2231
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,080
with is it would you

2232
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:41,760
would you think bash is good enough or

2233
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,760
maybe go for python or

2234
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:46,880
what's your thoughts around that bash's

2235
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:50,560
is like super powerful for doing

2236
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,480
hacky things like that that's basically

2237
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,320
how i kind of look at bash

2238
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,679
but if you want to build something

2239
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:57,840
that's more scalable um

2240
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,040
and you want to build something that's

2241
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:02,000
going to kind of um how do i put it

2242
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,440
i know be more

2243
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:06,880
stand the test of time and more

2244
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,480
resilient that's what i was looking for

2245
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,000
you want something more resilient and

2246
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:10,960
more scalable

2247
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,040
you're probably going to want to look at

2248
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:14,080
something else

2249
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,760
other than bash bash makes it really

2250
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:18,719
hard to interact with

2251
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:21,760
databases and things like that and and

2252
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:22,640
personally

2253
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:25,679
i put time into learning a framework

2254
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:28,400
um and it's it's a web frame oh it's

2255
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,239
django right so it's a python web

2256
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:31,199
framework

2257
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:33,760
and um the reason that i i kind of

2258
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:34,320
learned that

2259
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,640
is because it's got a great orm which is

2260
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:37,920
uh the way that

2261
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,920
the framework interacts with the

2262
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,040
database

2263
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,280
so um i was able to do that also it's in

2264
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,159
python and i

2265
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:47,360
i knew like a bit of python already um

2266
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,679
and like that's that's the way that i

2267
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:50,880
did it but

2268
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,080
i didn't want to say that in the talk

2269
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,520
because there are just like a billion

2270
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,120
different ways to do automation and

2271
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,880
every single person that has automation

2272
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,400
is going to do it differently

2273
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,880
um you know doing it in django and

2274
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:03,120
python had some serious disadvantages

2275
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,120
but it had a lot of advantages too

2276
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,960
and i think no matter what way you do it

2277
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,719
it's gonna have disadvantages like for

2278
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:10,320
example donut the other day

2279
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,159
you probably saw his tweet he put up a

2280
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:14,080
tweet that said i actually regret

2281
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,679
writing all my stuff in rust because no

2282
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:17,040
one ever collaborates because no one

2283
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,880
knows rust and i'm like

2284
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:21,280
that's a good point like rust is amazing

2285
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,120
and it's super fast and like the guys

2286
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,880
really switched on and can code anything

2287
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:27,280
in rust but he'll never get any uh

2288
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:30,159
well he'll never get a huge amount of

2289
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:31,679
collaborative support from the community

2290
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:32,000
because

2291
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,440
it's not a language that's used very

2292
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:34,880
much so you might want to look at stuff

2293
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:35,600
like that to

2294
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:38,640
support and everything um but i think i

2295
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,000
know where you're going with this vortex

2296
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:40,800
and that is like

2297
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,120
the the classic do i need to code to do

2298
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:43,920
bug bounties

2299
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,360
and do it and what language should i

2300
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:47,520
learn that's right yeah essentially that

2301
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:48,719
was the that was the root of the

2302
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:49,199
question

2303
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:52,560
yeah yeah so do you need to code no um

2304
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,840
and you know the and the question

2305
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,280
do i need to be able to code to do bug

2306
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:59,440
bounties is a binary answer

2307
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,440
and you only need one person who can do

2308
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,040
bug bounties without coding

2309
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,960
uh and then the answer is no so you

2310
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,480
don't need to because there are some top

2311
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,840
hackers who

2312
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:11,040
at least say that they can't code um but

2313
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,880
is it gonna help you hell yeah it's

2314
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,320
gonna help you you

2315
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:17,440
you know every time every time you find

2316
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:18,560
a zero day

2317
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:21,920
or or um you find some kind some type of

2318
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:22,560
bug

2319
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,480
um if you can't code and you don't have

2320
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,159
your automation set up or whatever then

2321
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:29,440
you're gonna find it once if you find a

2322
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:29,840
bug

2323
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,159
and it's in some software like like a

2324
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:34,320
wordpress plugin or whatever

2325
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,640
and um yeah you find that bug you can

2326
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,800
now test that out on all of your hosts

2327
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,040
very easily by writing a script right

2328
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:42,239
and if you've already got your

2329
01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:43,520
automation set up you can probably get

2330
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,840
that scanning in like an hour or two

2331
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,960
so i think you know that's how i use

2332
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,600
my coding skill and i think it's super

2333
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:52,239
um

2334
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:54,800
super beneficial super helpful but it's

2335
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:55,360
not

2336
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,920
a prerequisite to being able to do bad

2337
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:58,640
bounties

2338
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:00,800
it's just um for me it's been very

2339
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:01,840
helpful

2340
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:05,440
so yeah i completely agree so

2341
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,920
we know uh kodingo's recently not not so

2342
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,360
recently but it's got a got the tool

2343
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:11,679
called interlace which is a really great

2344
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:13,840
tool for for scaling out sideways with a

2345
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:15,280
well you might have a single script but

2346
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:16,159
you can

2347
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:17,920
scale it out with that and run it a lot

2348
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,239
faster

2349
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,560
yeah so that um i guess if you don't

2350
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:24,480
know how to code but you know what tools

2351
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,239
you want to use the goal of that is that

2352
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:28,719
you can build run files so you can say

2353
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:31,360
run nmap then run this then run this and

2354
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,800
build out a target list so

2355
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,800
um sajeeb lehani and i did that when we

2356
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:35,920
were pen testers

2357
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,080
because as a pen tester you land on a

2358
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:39,440
network you'll write a script you want

2359
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:40,239
to run it everywhere

2360
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:42,880
but same applies for um the bounty space

2361
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,640
you just in a more external facing

2362
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:46,159
capacity

2363
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:50,000
much more scale needed too yeah so

2364
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,800
basically what what i use interlace for

2365
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:53,280
is

2366
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:56,400
like if i if i want to quick if i want

2367
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,000
to quickly do something at scale

2368
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,560
and i just put together like a crappy

2369
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,719
script that just like checks one host

2370
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:04,159
i don't want to have to spend hours and

2371
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:06,719
hours like refining my script to take in

2372
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:09,280
multiple hosts and do multi-threading

2373
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:12,159
and um you know work over cidr ranges

2374
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:13,600
and things like that so

2375
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,840
um basically what interlaced allows me

2376
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:17,840
to do is write a crappy script

2377
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:21,199
to do a poc and then um interlace allows

2378
01:16:21,199 --> 01:16:22,000
me to scale

2379
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
quickly with and and you can do that if

2380
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,679
you don't have like a proper autumn like

2381
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:27,520
a full-on automation system set up you

2382
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:28,640
can just use interlace

2383
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:31,120
and it will probably do the same thing

2384
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:31,920
you know what i mean

2385
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,520
so it's super powerful for that kind of

2386
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,840
thing

2387
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:40,719
but i guess um

2388
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:42,719
automation we've kind of covered the

2389
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:44,239
mindset where you begin

2390
01:16:44,239 --> 01:16:46,239
um and in terms of language stack and

2391
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:47,520
things like that but

2392
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:50,480
bounties in general you start today

2393
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:51,679
what's your

2394
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:53,199
what's your first action what's the

2395
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:54,719
first thing you would do you sign up and

2396
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:55,840
you want to start

2397
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,520
and beyond the just start what's the

2398
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,120
first thing that you're doing

2399
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,840
so education is number one uh the

2400
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:04,000
resources i mentioned in the talk so

2401
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,080
jason haddick's stuff anything from json

2402
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:07,199
addicts um

2403
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:08,800
following a lot of people on twitter

2404
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:10,320
getting involved in the community

2405
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,400
um pen tester lab web application

2406
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,920
hackers handbook they're like the few

2407
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,600
ones that i recommend constantly

2408
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,360
i feel like if you start with those then

2409
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:18,800
after that you'll be able to find your

2410
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,080
own resources and you'll know the

2411
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,440
difference between a good one and a bad

2412
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:22,000
one

2413
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,080
um so that's like a that's like

2414
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,760
fundamentals for me

2415
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,920
um but yeah if if you're coming from a

2416
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,679
space where you already know how to hack

2417
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:30,320
um

2418
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:31,600
the next thing would be educating

2419
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:34,159
yourself on how bug bounties work

2420
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:36,960
so you know uh no matter which platform

2421
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:37,760
you're hacking on

2422
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:41,120
there'll be documentation on like the

2423
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,440
how many points you get for what um what

2424
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,360
you can expect to be paid out on the on

2425
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,040
the bouncy profiles what's in scope

2426
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:48,480
what's out of scope what kind of

2427
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,800
vulnerabilities we um accept and what

2428
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,159
kind of vulnerabilities we don't accept

2429
01:17:52,159 --> 01:17:54,080
so that's the side of education as well

2430
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:54,400
so

2431
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:55,920
at the point i'm trying to make is even

2432
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,199
if you're a pentester and you start

2433
01:17:57,199 --> 01:17:58,640
doing bug bounties you've still got some

2434
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,000
education to do

2435
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,320
um although nowhere near as much and

2436
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:03,520
then um

2437
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:06,800
once you're educated i'd be focusing on

2438
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:10,239
um bug bounties on sorry on automation

2439
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:13,280
and and um also

2440
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:15,840
i would be but not just automation like

2441
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,360
i said in the talk i'd be focusing half

2442
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,560
my time on automation

2443
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,960
half my time on manual hacking the ideas

2444
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,719
that you get from manual hacking you can

2445
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:24,000
apply to automation

2446
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,440
and the ideas that you might get while

2447
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,040
you're coding on automation you can also

2448
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,480
apply to manual hacking so

2449
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,800
i think it's important to have both um i

2450
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:31,760
know i pushed the

2451
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:34,239
the automation thing a lot in in my talk

2452
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:35,440
um in terms of like

2453
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:38,800
generating passive income but you really

2454
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,040
you really do need to do both i think

2455
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:41,840
and um

2456
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,920
you know those big those big bucks those

2457
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,520
big bounty payouts

2458
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:48,800
usually uh don't

2459
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:50,880
uh come from automation right so for

2460
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:52,880
automation you tend to be scanning for

2461
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:53,520
things that

2462
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,360
are lower risk and there tend to be a

2463
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,600
lot of people scanning for them so

2464
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,080
it just depends um but i do want to make

2465
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,440
another point there too

2466
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:04,880
and that is um that

2467
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,640
when we're scanning for stuff at using

2468
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:09,120
automation it's easy to just be like

2469
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,280
i want to find vulnerabilities and i

2470
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,120
send this probe and i receive this

2471
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,120
and is it a vulnerability yes or no like

2472
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:16,719
we're looking for binary stuff

2473
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:20,080
but i think um you know i think a trend

2474
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,199
that's happening

2475
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:22,640
at the moment is that people are

2476
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,400
realizing that a lot of stuff can't be

2477
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:25,199
automated

2478
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:28,239
but there are ways to hint at things

2479
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:28,640
that

2480
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:30,640
might be vulnerable that you can scan

2481
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:33,120
for in an automated way so

2482
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:36,239
for example um one thing

2483
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:39,120
that i've done in the past is pulled cve

2484
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:40,320
results from showdown

2485
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:44,880
right and each cv has has a um

2486
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:47,360
a cvss score and if you just add those

2487
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:49,120
cvss scores up you can get a

2488
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,600
you can get like a decent idea of how

2489
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,199
vulnerable that machine might be or how

2490
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:54,560
old it is because it's running old

2491
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:55,920
versions of apache or whatever so you

2492
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:57,920
can kind of prioritize which host to

2493
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:59,120
hack on in that way

2494
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:01,280
so you know automation is not just about

2495
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:03,120
flat out finding vulnerabilities

2496
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:06,639
it's also about being able to

2497
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:10,159
um prioritize the host that you do your

2498
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:11,280
manual hacking with

2499
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:14,800
and it's about being able to um

2500
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,679
you know find hints at vulnerabilities

2501
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:18,320
so

2502
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:19,280
i don't know how to put it more

2503
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:21,199
succinctly than that but you there are

2504
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:22,400
not there are not a whole lot of

2505
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,760
vulnerabilities that you can just scan

2506
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,440
for and get definite results for

2507
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,280
so sometimes you need to be looking for

2508
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:29,199
for hints and prioritizing targets to

2509
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:32,560
manually hack on if that makes sense

2510
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:35,840
yeah 100 that is i i

2511
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,199
didn't think to put that trick out i'm

2512
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:38,880
kind of sad it's out now but that is

2513
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:42,159
one of the key tricks that uh luke and i

2514
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:43,679
use for identifying where to look

2515
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:45,679
and the other thing since we've given

2516
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:47,760
that up and i'm going to start

2517
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,280
the best part of luke's talk i think

2518
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:50,800
there was um

2519
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,080
it's not just about monitoring

2520
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,360
vulnerabilities it's about monitoring

2521
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:54,960
points of change we put

2522
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:57,360
a lot of time into working out how do

2523
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:58,880
you identify that an asset

2524
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,560
has changed so you can look again

2525
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:02,719
because others a lot of people do state

2526
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:03,679
in time recon

2527
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:05,440
they pick up a mass they pick up sub

2528
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:07,920
finder they run all of their recon

2529
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,520
and then they come back to it later and

2530
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:11,360
amass

2531
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,120
with jeff foley today they've just added

2532
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:15,199
change tracking that's really key but

2533
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:17,040
doing it at a finer level than just new

2534
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,960
domains appearing and disappearing

2535
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,800
allows you to go test an asset that's

2536
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,800
changed and that

2537
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,400
you know such an underrated piece of

2538
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,080
your talk that i really wanted to kind

2539
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:26,960
of put a

2540
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,960
a bit of a bold around because i think

2541
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,000
it's really key to

2542
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,360
finding things that others are missing

2543
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:33,199
because if you continuously monitor it

2544
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:34,560
and others aren't and they come along

2545
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:35,840
and they just start monitoring it

2546
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:36,800
they're not going to look in the same

2547
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:37,920
place you are

2548
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,840
yeah and and here's something here's

2549
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,600
here's a tip this is something that i've

2550
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,040
been wanting to do for a while but i

2551
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,480
just haven't gotten around to it so now

2552
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,159
someone's gonna beat me to it but anyway

2553
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:49,679
that's okay so one of the things that i

2554
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:52,320
recommend doing is endpoints on targets

2555
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,679
right so if you're

2556
01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:55,440
if you've got automation set up that

2557
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,679
crawls the target and finds endpoints so

2558
01:21:57,679 --> 01:21:59,360
for example if you've got hack crawler

2559
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:00,800
running on on all of your different

2560
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,000
subdomains or

2561
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
some other crawler whatever you'll get a

2562
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,440
bunch of endpoints back and

2563
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,520
and when those endpoints change it's a

2564
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:10,159
good time to look at that target and and

2565
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:12,080
have a look at the new endpoints right

2566
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:13,520
because if you're finding new endpoints

2567
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,719
then

2568
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:16,480
that's new functionality that that you

2569
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:18,480
can explore and and not many people are

2570
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:19,120
monitoring

2571
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:22,080
endpoints at the moment so that means

2572
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,280
that you're going to be

2573
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,719
one of the few people that's going to

2574
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:26,560
see that change and you're going to be

2575
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,400
probably the only person that actually

2576
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:29,840
checks it out right even though there

2577
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:31,199
are loads of bug bounty hunters

2578
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:32,560
these are the kind of niches that you've

2579
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:33,760
got to be looking for when you're bug

2580
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:35,280
bouncing hunting right

2581
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:37,440
and then another thing that hack crawler

2582
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,920
does is it dumps javascript files

2583
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,159
now if you can get the urls of all

2584
01:22:42,159 --> 01:22:43,679
javascript files that are in use for a

2585
01:22:43,679 --> 01:22:45,199
particular application

2586
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:46,800
and then you can constantly monitor

2587
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,400
those javascript files for

2588
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:51,199
um just changes like particularly like

2589
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:53,040
if if that javascript file changes

2590
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:56,719
size then you're basically

2591
01:22:56,719 --> 01:22:59,679
getting back like functionality change

2592
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:01,600
in that application and javascript files

2593
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:02,480
are such a

2594
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:05,360
treasure trove of like money basically

2595
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:06,159
you know they're

2596
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:08,080
they're a treasure trove of information

2597
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:09,520
about that application

2598
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,679
that you can use to exploit it so if

2599
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:13,040
you're one of the first people to see

2600
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:15,040
that javascript file after it changes

2601
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,639
there's a good chance that if there's a

2602
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:17,760
vulnerability there you're going to be

2603
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,360
the first one to report it so

2604
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:21,199
it's little niches like that like that's

2605
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:22,639
just one example and

2606
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:24,159
i'm i'm fine about giving this stuff

2607
01:23:24,159 --> 01:23:25,760
away because there are just like a

2608
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:28,159
billion other niches that that you can

2609
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:29,679
that you can target and they need that

2610
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:31,440
you can look at it and that's never

2611
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:32,800
going to stop there's always going to be

2612
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,159
more things to look at and more things

2613
01:23:34,159 --> 01:23:35,520
that people aren't doing even if they've

2614
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,120
thought of it like implementing it as a

2615
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,880
whole other thing right so

2616
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,159
so yeah i find that the

2617
01:23:42,159 --> 01:23:44,159
the times that i've made money like just

2618
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:46,800
trying to kind of generalize

2619
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:49,600
um the whole process and and the times

2620
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:52,000
that i've been successful

2621
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
it's been when i've found a niche and

2622
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,120
i've i've found

2623
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:57,280
this like one thing that i'm the only

2624
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,400
one that's doing that

2625
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,719
so so i'm the first one that sees that

2626
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:02,480
i'm the first one that's that's

2627
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:04,320
able to like check it out and that's not

2628
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,239
necessarily like a type of vulnerability

2629
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:07,520
or a zero day or whatever

2630
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,360
it's like finding a particular way to

2631
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:10,800
look at hosts or a particular way to

2632
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:11,920
scan hosts

2633
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:14,800
that nobody else is doing so um this is

2634
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:15,120
like

2635
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:17,040
this is this is like when people say

2636
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,800
like um

2637
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:21,120
you know the hacker mentality or they

2638
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,320
say um

2639
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,080
the hacker mindset things like that that

2640
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:25,679
this is what they're referring to

2641
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:27,199
you're you're finding little different

2642
01:24:27,199 --> 01:24:28,719
ways of doing things that that people

2643
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:30,400
haven't thought of and you're looking at

2644
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:31,120
like

2645
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:34,880
um abusing functionality in ways that

2646
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:35,600
other people

2647
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,520
wouldn't have thought to do or whatever

2648
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:39,199
and yeah anyway

2649
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:40,639
that's that's that's kind of something

2650
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:42,880
that i wanted to get across

2651
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,639
no that's that's that's real that's

2652
01:24:44,639 --> 01:24:46,560
really powerful and super underrated too

2653
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,000
because i think there's

2654
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,440
yeah there's hunters that that go wide

2655
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:51,760
like

2656
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,840
almost every hunter starts going wide

2657
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,440
across stuff and just looking everywhere

2658
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:56,719
for things because part of what they're

2659
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:57,199
doing is

2660
01:24:57,199 --> 01:24:59,360
learning in the process as well but then

2661
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,040
as they do that there's like

2662
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:02,719
the particular techniques that allow

2663
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:05,440
depth to plug into their skill set or

2664
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:06,639
their interest and that's

2665
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:08,719
this continuously iterative thing

2666
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:11,120
because you know eventually

2667
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:12,880
you get bored of a particular technique

2668
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,320
or a particular kill chain or whatever

2669
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,239
else or you get new input from going

2670
01:25:16,239 --> 01:25:17,120
wide

2671
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,280
um in in such a way that it makes you

2672
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:20,639
you know kind of diversify your skill

2673
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:22,080
set at that point in time like that

2674
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:23,040
whole

2675
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:25,840
kind of relationship between this very

2676
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:26,480
broad

2677
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:28,000
like i just want to hoover up

2678
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
information and learn stuff

2679
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,639
and then you know as we go along it

2680
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:34,400
connects into this new part of interest

2681
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:36,239
i can then engage and be effective with

2682
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:38,159
that's a that's a really important

2683
01:25:38,159 --> 01:25:40,159
aspect of personal growth that i think

2684
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:43,040
um doesn't get talked about a lot

2685
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,040
it's also we're early in the phase of

2686
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,400
recon we're still at the point where

2687
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,239
everyone talks about it as if

2688
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:51,520
recon finds stop like we look at github

2689
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:51,920
right

2690
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,520
everyone's searching for credentials on

2691
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,679
github when one of the key things you

2692
01:25:55,679 --> 01:25:57,120
can be doing is actually looking for

2693
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,040
endpoints that no one else is touching

2694
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:01,199
and those credentials most of the time

2695
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:02,400
lack and impact and

2696
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,080
don't end up being a valid finding but

2697
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:06,000
if you find endpoints you can go and

2698
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,280
find things that others have never

2699
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:08,719
actually tested on

2700
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:10,960
and it's it's funny to me particularly

2701
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:12,880
jumping into triage seeing

2702
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:14,320
all of these people doing a lot of work

2703
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:16,159
in github and they're going oh i've

2704
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:17,440
found these credentials they

2705
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:18,800
either have tested and found they're not

2706
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:19,920
valid or they haven't tested and they're

2707
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:20,719
not valid

2708
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:22,320
but not actually going to the point of

2709
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:25,280
looking for domains new assets or

2710
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,960
how does that you know credential that i

2711
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:29,360
found tie into a bit broader impact

2712
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:30,560
and that's where the real money is

2713
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:32,080
that's where the most successful people

2714
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:33,600
are putting their effort is to

2715
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,080
use recon as a tool a wide coverage tool

2716
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,600
but then to go really deep on what

2717
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,159
they're finding

2718
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:44,400
yeah absolutely absolutely and like this

2719
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:45,600
this concept i think

2720
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:50,320
applies i mean i'm sure cj you could

2721
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:51,920
you could probably attest to this more

2722
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,600
than than i could but i think it works

2723
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:54,560
in business too

2724
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,719
like you speak you hear about the niche

2725
01:26:56,719 --> 01:26:58,560
niche everybody's gotta find the niche

2726
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,760
like when you're talking about like you

2727
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:02,080
know drop shipping bros or like

2728
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:05,040
big or like you know finding the next uh

2729
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:06,320
what is that crypto

2730
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,560
currency or whatever that's gonna boom i

2731
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:09,840
think like um

2732
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:11,120
like this is what everyone's trying to

2733
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,880
do everyone's trying to find that little

2734
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:14,320
thing that no one else has thought of

2735
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:14,960
yet and

2736
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:17,040
and bug bounties are no different it's

2737
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:18,080
it's really interesting

2738
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:19,840
because bug bounces you're working

2739
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:21,679
across a huge

2740
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:24,239
range of targets the people working on

2741
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:26,080
it are from all different cultures

2742
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:27,600
all different backgrounds all different

2743
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:29,920
educations they've had different mentors

2744
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:31,440
some people are coming at it from binary

2745
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:33,679
or mobile or wherever whatever and like

2746
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:34,880
you've still got to find something

2747
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:35,920
that's unique

2748
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:39,199
it's like it's like it's like hard but

2749
01:27:39,199 --> 01:27:42,800
that's that's in my opinion that's where

2750
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:45,440
um that's where like bug bounties that's

2751
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:47,360
where you become successful

2752
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:50,320
being creative and i can i completely

2753
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:51,600
agree like i

2754
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,719
i draw so when i talk to entrepreneurs a

2755
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:55,600
lot as

2756
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:58,080
a founder um i draw parallels between

2757
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:00,239
defensive security and and building a

2758
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:01,040
business

2759
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,480
all the time because it's like

2760
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:04,719
fundamentally the same thing you start

2761
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:06,239
you start from point a you want to get

2762
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:08,159
to point b you've got

2763
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:09,520
you know a limited set of tools

2764
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:11,120
available at your disposal and a whole

2765
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:12,480
bunch of stuff trying to stop you

2766
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:14,159
and your job is to create a path which

2767
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:15,520
is no different

2768
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:17,360
to hacking a system at the end of the

2769
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:18,639
day in terms of

2770
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:20,400
you know what your brain's doing to kind

2771
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,840
of execute all that

2772
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:24,159
um obviously what you're playing with

2773
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:25,679
and all those different things and and

2774
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:26,800
like the

2775
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,199
there's a lot of difference to it but

2776
01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:31,040
like the fundamentals i think are

2777
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:33,760
very much the same so i think that's

2778
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:34,400
it's

2779
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,880
a very transferable skill set really

2780
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:38,000
when you think about it when you can get

2781
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,480
into this idea of like okay i'm gonna

2782
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:43,600
you know be like relentlessly focused on

2783
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,520
the path but approach it as continuous

2784
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,520
learning i think the other bit that's

2785
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:49,440
that's um you know important and just

2786
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:51,199
kind of logical to call out is that like

2787
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:53,600
for someone who's building a system

2788
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:55,600
they're not they're not thinking about

2789
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,199
xss or

2790
01:28:57,199 --> 01:28:59,600
or you know injection or whatever else

2791
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,120
they're thinking about making the system

2792
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,400
works with whatever

2793
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,000
has gone into that like you think about

2794
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,880
a connected car now you've got

2795
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:10,480
you know cunix running on an arm chip

2796
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:11,040
talking

2797
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:13,520
out the tire through a radio sensor to a

2798
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:14,880
thing that you've just driven past

2799
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:16,880
that's got an api with a

2800
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:18,560
mobile app blah blah blah there's all

2801
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:20,960
this convergent attack surface that goes

2802
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:22,400
into these systems

2803
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,000
and that's ultimately what we're here to

2804
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,080
try to you know find vulnerabilities in

2805
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:27,440
so they can be de-risked

2806
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:29,600
so like there's this incredible breadth

2807
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,920
of stuff that you can end up

2808
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:34,480
focusing in on the only way you can you

2809
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,239
know pursue new things is if you've got

2810
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:38,159
at least some sort of eye on

2811
01:29:38,159 --> 01:29:41,040
how broad that that spectrum actually is

2812
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,560
so it's good depth and breadth i think

2813
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:42,880
is

2814
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:44,480
you know the the two have a really tight

2815
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:46,560
relationship and i think being able to

2816
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:47,920
navigate being able to

2817
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:50,480
improve both at the same time if you can

2818
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:53,520
pull that off then then you're winning

2819
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:55,280
i just want to give an example i want to

2820
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:56,880
give an example of that from

2821
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:59,600
my music day so using that that hacker

2822
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:00,239
mindset

2823
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:03,120
um you know basically when streaming

2824
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:04,800
came out when streaming became a thing

2825
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:06,000
when spotify became

2826
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,159
a thing a lot of musicians were super

2827
01:30:08,159 --> 01:30:10,159
angry because you get paid like

2828
01:30:10,159 --> 01:30:13,280
point zero two percent uh cents per

2829
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:15,520
stream or like some ridiculously

2830
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:18,320
tiny amount of money and um musicians

2831
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,239
were used to only earning money from cd

2832
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:21,440
sales at the time right

2833
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:24,400
which is like you get at least like 15

2834
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:25,120
20 bucks

2835
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:28,320
for selling an album so um a lot of

2836
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:29,840
people were super angry about that so

2837
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,360
there were the people that got angry

2838
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:31,840
about it

2839
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:33,520
and are still angry about it and still

2840
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:34,960
post about it on facebook all the time

2841
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:36,320
because a lot of my friends musicians i

2842
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:37,520
still see a lot of it

2843
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:39,120
and then there are the people who were

2844
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:40,639
like okay

2845
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:42,560
the games changed time it's a new

2846
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,920
opportunity for me

2847
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:45,840
to figure out the system and figure out

2848
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:46,960
how it works okay

2849
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:49,679
and i saw two great hacks you could call

2850
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:50,560
them hacks

2851
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:52,639
for this one band was like we need to

2852
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:54,080
raise money for a tour

2853
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,840
so what we're going to do is release an

2854
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,239
album it had like 10 tracks on it and

2855
01:30:58,239 --> 01:31:00,159
the tracks went for three minutes each

2856
01:31:00,159 --> 01:31:03,199
and they were just dead silent no music

2857
01:31:03,199 --> 01:31:03,679
at all

2858
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:05,679
and they called the album sleepify and

2859
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:07,360
they were like hey if you want us to

2860
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:08,159
come on tour

2861
01:31:08,159 --> 01:31:09,600
everyone's got to play this album while

2862
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:12,159
they sleep on repeat so they made it

2863
01:31:12,159 --> 01:31:14,800
money because they got so many streams

2864
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:15,280
because

2865
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:16,800
everyone was just playing this album on

2866
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,480
repeat even though there was no sound

2867
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:20,639
at all so they made a stack of royalties

2868
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:21,920
off that and then they used that to go

2869
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:22,800
on tour

2870
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:25,840
and then the other way that i saw this

2871
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,520
guy who was like

2872
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:30,719
a average musician just bought a baby

2873
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:32,400
name book and was like all right

2874
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:34,800
i'm going to record happy birthday in

2875
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,080
every single name

2876
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:37,520
so it'll be like happy birthday to you

2877
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:39,679
birthday to you happy birthday

2878
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:41,600
clarisse uh happy birthday to you i've

2879
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,760
been out there do you have an idea

2880
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,520
daniel happy birthday to you like

2881
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:46,400
whatever it was

2882
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,159
and he just he just released that for

2883
01:31:48,159 --> 01:31:50,080
every single every single name

2884
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:51,760
and the guy's a millionaire now right

2885
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:54,639
just from the toilet hey

2886
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:58,000
did he automate that

2887
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:05,520
[Laughter]

2888
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:08,560
um yes like you know even though you

2889
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:09,440
know i'll keep the

2890
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:11,199
the ethical argument of streaming out of

2891
01:32:11,199 --> 01:32:13,280
it out of this conversation entirely but

2892
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:15,440
when i but the game changed right

2893
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:18,159
the game changed and some people some

2894
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:19,679
people winched about it and failed

2895
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:21,679
and then some people saw the new system

2896
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:22,880
as an opportunity

2897
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:25,920
to grow and they smashed it so like it's

2898
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:27,360
the same thing with it's the same thing

2899
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:28,560
with bug bounties

2900
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:30,719
um you know you've got to treat it like

2901
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:31,760
a game and

2902
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:34,639
you've got to be like how can i best uh

2903
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:36,480
even though it's very high competition

2904
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:39,120
how can i still find bugs and like

2905
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:40,320
that's how to do it you need to be

2906
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,639
creative

2907
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:44,880
so one one thing that was probably uh

2908
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:45,920
probably important to

2909
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:49,760
to mention with regards to success is

2910
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:51,760
success in bug bounties is not

2911
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:53,199
necessarily about the amount of

2912
01:32:53,199 --> 01:32:54,480
submissions you make

2913
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:58,560
or the money you earn it's about impact

2914
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:01,360
so yeah impact to the to the customers

2915
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:02,239
you know we've

2916
01:33:02,239 --> 01:33:04,400
you might find a you might find an rce

2917
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:07,040
or something on a free program

2918
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:10,639
that's a good impact you know

2919
01:33:10,639 --> 01:33:13,280
totally we've there's been examples of

2920
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:14,400
that some we've

2921
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:15,840
some of the recent zero days that have

2922
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:16,800
been out there have actually been

2923
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:18,239
reported through our platform before

2924
01:33:18,239 --> 01:33:19,120
they were even

2925
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:22,159
released many many times yeah sometimes

2926
01:33:22,159 --> 01:33:23,199
months before right

2927
01:33:23,199 --> 01:33:26,400
yeah a hundred percent yeah there's a

2928
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:26,639
key

2929
01:33:26,639 --> 01:33:28,000
thing they're almost they're almost

2930
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,159
never sorry go ahead michael

2931
01:33:30,159 --> 01:33:31,360
there's a key thing here one thing

2932
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:33,199
that's a bit of a

2933
01:33:33,199 --> 01:33:35,679
people make this mistake there's bug

2934
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:36,719
bounty tips as a

2935
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:38,639
as a tweet has become a way of people

2936
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:40,320
promoting themselves and it's less about

2937
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:42,800
good bugs these days so let's say dmacc

2938
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:43,679
for example

2939
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:46,320
if you're reporting dmarc on a non-email

2940
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,400
based domain the company doesn't use it

2941
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:50,159
what's the impact to them what is that

2942
01:33:50,159 --> 01:33:51,840
what is a hacker going to do

2943
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:55,040
it's not like it's not o day and like

2944
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:56,800
they just it's it's one of those things

2945
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,000
where it's like

2946
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,679
that statement that i mentioned earlier

2947
01:33:59,679 --> 01:34:01,280
as an attacker i can

2948
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:03,360
it's as an attacker i can send email on

2949
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:05,199
a domain the company's never sent email

2950
01:34:05,199 --> 01:34:06,560
from before and it's got

2951
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:08,159
a subdomain in front of it and it's got

2952
01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:10,159
no value right the company

2953
01:34:10,159 --> 01:34:11,199
the customer is just not going to

2954
01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:13,280
resonate with that and versus you know

2955
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:14,719
looking for things that have

2956
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:18,400
customer impact that's it don't report a

2957
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:19,600
mark

2958
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:22,080
it's a joke

2959
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:26,400
it's probably a dude

2960
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:30,239
next that's our next t-shirt i think

2961
01:34:30,239 --> 01:34:32,000
the lesson is if you really are

2962
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,600
concerned and you don't want to dupe and

2963
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:34,880
you really want to do things

2964
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:37,040
go to pen test lab sign up do the

2965
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:38,080
essentials badge

2966
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:41,440
learn how to go deep and then use your

2967
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:43,360
really acquired recon skills from like

2968
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:44,800
this talk and bug bounty hunters

2969
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:45,600
methodology

2970
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:47,840
to find somewhere to go deep don't use

2971
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:49,520
it to find something to

2972
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:51,440
run over you know those those categories

2973
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:52,880
that won't impact

2974
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:55,360
or have some sort of tie back use it to

2975
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:58,000
look for xss or to look for

2976
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,080
you know csrf in an app that maybe no

2977
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:01,280
one's touched before

2978
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:03,360
there you go all right well look i think

2979
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,280
we're gonna would button up on time here

2980
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:05,679

2981
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:08,560
thank you so much luke that was that was

2982
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:09,840
baller and um

2983
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:11,679
you know i mean michael mentioned it in

2984
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:13,280
the intro it's something that i've

2985
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,280
really enjoyed about having you in the

2986
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:16,800
scene but uh having you as part of bug

2987
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:18,000
crowd as well as just the way that you

2988
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,600
unpack the the mentality

2989
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,760
and really focus on that and but then

2990
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:23,440
connect that to the technology as well

2991
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:24,639
so it's not just all about the

2992
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:26,400
psychology it's not just all about the

2993
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:27,920
tooling it's about how those things plug

2994
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:28,639
together

2995
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:31,679
that was a fantastic talk um i think a

2996
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:32,880
lot of people are going to get value out

2997
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:35,600
of it for a long time so appreciate it

2998
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:40,320

01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:42,040
