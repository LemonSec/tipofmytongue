[Music]

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,559
all right well

3
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,079
up next we have um two people from

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,920
skype and uh it's a you might be

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,119
hearing it and then spelling it

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,240
differently in your head so i'm gonna

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,439
spell it out s

8
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,760
c y t h e and um i've kind of been

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,000
um well i mean i've heard of them before

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,439
the understanding that i have is that

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,040
they've built out a platform that

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,760
basically

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,640
simulates cyber attacks which is a super

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,000
helpful thing for

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,239
um organizations obviously because they

16
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,040
are able to

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,600
simulate cyber attacks check how their

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,160
um

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,680
their blue team kind of reacts and

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,600
things like that but i'm not i'm not

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,719
fully okay with

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,920
all of the details so i'm definitely

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,559
gonna um be hoping that they explain all

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:53,920
that but the two people that are coming

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,120
on are there

26
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,160
cto and the founder of sky

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,680
so this the founder is bryson bought um

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,519
he is um amazing and then the

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,479
theater is jorge ochiles i hope i'm

30
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,159
pronouncing that correctly but i think

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,000
it's actually george

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,159
it's george is that oh no

33
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,840
yeah i i can vouch the tool is amazing

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,000
like genuinely it's really really good

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,680
yeah yeah it looks really cool just

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,200
going off what i'm saying so

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,640
the talk name is it's not a

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,479
vulnerability it's a feature and i'm

39
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,280
just going to read the

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,880
abstract flat out because it's a really

41
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,119
good abstract how many times have you

42
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:33,600
heard

43
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,159
it's not a vulnerability it's a feature

44
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,079
after finding some functionality that

45
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:38,560
you

46
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,040
are sure can be used maliciously it

47
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,399
happens quite frequently

48
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,799
there is an entire project called living

49
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,720
off the land binaries and scripts

50
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,960
lol bass and actually that's a really

51
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,399
really cool repository you should check

52
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,439
it out

53
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,360
um that features microsoft signed

54
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,960
binaries and scripts that allow

55
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,399
attackers to leverage the built-in

56
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,920
features for their own good

57
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,320
this happens a lot and it's why we want

58
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,040
to talk about

59
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,479
how the offensive security uh

60
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,240
industry has evolved and matured from

61
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,199
cves to ttps

62
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,360
while finding bugs and vulnerabilities

63
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,239
pays

64
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,400
how can one benefit from when it is a

65
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,280
feature

66
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,680
by creating sharing and selling ttps we

67
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,760
can all benefit from the work that was

68
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,640
already done

69
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,720
but vendors don't want to pay for so

70
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,680
this is going to be

71
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,400
super helpful just going off the thing

72
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,440
it's going to be super

73
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,040
super super helpful for um you know

74
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,720
blue teams it's going to be super

75
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,360
helpful for red teamers who are doing

76
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,120
kind of internal networks and stuff like

77
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,680
that

78
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,160
if you can um if you can basically hack

79
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,840
networks without using any

80
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,440
exploits or vulnerabilities but you're

81
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,440
just using microsoft signed

82
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,599
binaries and you're literally using them

83
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,879
how they are intended

84
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,920
to um to you know get domain and admin

85
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,280
or whatever you're trying to do

86
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,280
then um you're going to do a whole whole

87
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,319
lot better and

88
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,400
um you're going to spring off a whole

89
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,360
lot less

90
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,840
alerts to the blue team so definitely a

91
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,800
cool skill

92
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,920
um but yeah sky are doing a lot of work

93
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,000
in that space so i'm super

94
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:19,840
excited to see what they talk about

95
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,680
all right i think that means we're alive

96
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,400
george

97
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,599
i i think we're live it's not that

98
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,080
you're live

99
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,280
it's a feature is there anybody out

100
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,200
there

101
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,720
all right well how are you doing

102

trip

104
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,440
yeah i took a i took a day off unplugged

105
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,879
dropped all electronics

106
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,680
went off the grid i highly recommend it

107
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,560
nice

108
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,080
so can you see the slides i i can

109
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,760
i thought i was sharing oh you're

110
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,599
sharing yeah

111
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,519
okay i'll stop sharing then oh you man

112

oh there we go all right cool yes it'll

113
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,360
just be easier because i have the live

114
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,000
demo

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,159
so hi everyone um thanks for being here

116
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,519
and thank you to everyone at bug crowd

117
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,399
and all the organizers in the community

118
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,160
awesome awesome event i

119
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,400
had the uh the pleasure of catching a

120
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,600
few of the talks uh

121
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,280
this last panel was gray also the

122
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,960
hardware hacking stuff was pretty cool

123
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,520
so

124
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,560
um been in uh security for

125
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,560
some time and actually had the pleasure

126
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,080
of building a bug bounty

127
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,680
program at a large financial

128
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,440
organization that

129
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,440
at first did not think that this was a

130
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,720
good idea so

131
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,639
uh we did build it out with bug crowd

132
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,840
i'm happy that

133
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,600
that finally got there and you know like

134
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,680
large financials that's way longer than

135
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,000
would be expected but it's up so i have

136
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,639
a a lot of experience on that side and

137
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,360
really how we've gotten to this part is

138
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,000
that

139
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,280
i spent a lot of time finding

140
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,759
vulnerabilities and reporting those

141
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,960
vulnerabilities to

142
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,000
vendors and a lot of the times we would

143
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,479
hear

144
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,000
oh that's not a bug it's a feature and

145
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,600
working out financial we didn't really

146
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,120
get paid for any of it but

147
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,840
it was still annoying to hear that it's

148
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,520
not vulnerability it's a feature we're

149
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,400
not fixing that

150
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,960
and um it's kind of where where the talk

151
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,080
came from

152
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,280
so um just quick intro on that i am

153
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,759
george ortiz and thank you for

154
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,360
pronouncing the name right it's

155
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,919
it's it's always tough but uh but that's

156
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:30,400
me

157
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
uh we're both on twitter you can see it

158
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,160
down there at george or chia's and

159
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,639
at bryson board um the chief technology

160
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,240
officer here at scythe

161
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,919
and um been here three months now

162
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,160
before that was at city as i mentioned

163
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,600
uh built out

164
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,120
a number of things there including the

165
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,919
red team and some of the other functions

166
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,680
as far as giving back to the community

167
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,840
co-creator with bryson and adam

168
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,759
uh of the c2 matrix the command and

169
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,199
control matrix

170
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,880
there's 54 command controls there now so

171
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,080
definitely check that out

172
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,479
uh most of them are free and you can uh

173
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,360
play with them

174
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,080
also uh we published a purple team

175
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,560
exercise framework a couple weeks ago

176
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,039
uh and we have some cool news coming

177
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,560
about that but pretty much how to run

178
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,240
purple team engagements which are

179
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,199
more efficient than uh just doing a

180
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,240
yearly red team

181
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,400
uh really gets to operationalizing

182
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,360
things i teach for sans

183
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,319
i have a two day red team course i am

184
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,039
part of the cvss working group uh

185
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,440
we did version 3 and 3.1 i'm no longer a

186
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,280
voting member there because i left

187
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,880
my previous employer but we're working

188
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,919
on something else that's pretty cool

189
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,919
it's called the exploitability

190
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,880
uh predictability scoring system where

191
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,680
we're trying to

192
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,840
predict what vulnerabilities are going

193
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,880
to be exploited

194
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,440
as a prioritization thing so still doing

195
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,479
fun stuff there

196
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,880
um and ran some other stuff other

197
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,599
frameworks

198
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,160
uh fellow of issa and nsi

199
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,199
and that is bryson

200
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,280
yeah so for those of you who don't

201
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,360
recognize me uh this is what i looked

202
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:05,680
like

203
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,639
before i started to try out for the part

204
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,440
of

205
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,520
um the late great robin williams and

206
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,080
jumanji

207
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,000
um but uh i uh i founded uh grim

208
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,720
eight years ago um grimm is a

209
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,120
consultancy aka just a

210
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,039
best team of hackers doing a bunch of

211
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,639
hacking things i co-founded the

212
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,560
non-profit the ics village so we do

213
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,080
critical infrastructure education

214
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,720
and awareness i am a senior fellow at

215
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,400
the r street and national security

216
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,120
institute

217
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,319
in national security and cyber security

218
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,360
and i founded scythe

219
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,039
which was actually an idea that we came

220
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,360
across while we uh were

221
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,560
contracted by a large client at grimm

222
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,960
and most of you probably know me from

223
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,719
all of my unicorn shenanigans

224
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,960
all right so what i didn't cover in my

225
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,479
background there is i used to be an army

226
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,039
officer

227
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,199
and as an army officer everything has to

228
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,440
be really simple for me

229
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,599
and so whenever i think of the world i

230
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,360
split it up into

231
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,720
oh hey

232
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,280
get on there george sorry i'll tab uh

233
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,879
doesn't work too well so

234
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,840
there you go the world is split into

235
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,319
three

236
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,240
three people or three kinds of people or

237
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,919
three phases

238
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,840
red gray blue red

239
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,319
are the attackers in this case they're

240
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,680
the bad people but they can also be the

241
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,519
good hackers uh usually when i give this

242
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,719
up talking to

243
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,440
to enterprises gray is the internet this

244
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,880
is the whole intermediary

245
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,279
of how do i get from where i am to where

246
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,799
you are and what i want

247
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,240
and then blue that's us that's good

248
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,920
people these are the folks that are the

249
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,199
white hats and we're trying to defend

250
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,880
likewise i'm going to split down you've

251
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,880
heard of mitre attack and you've heard

252
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,320
of lockheed's kill chain

253
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,600
and who knows just like there are 54 c2

254
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,959
frameworks that we've documented in the

255
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,080
c2 matrix

256
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,920
at some point there will probably be 54

257
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,959
different ways that we're going to

258
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:05,839
describe

259
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,000
the attack path fundamentally i think

260
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,360
it's very simple

261
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,519
recon i'm gathering intelligence to

262
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,200
target access

263
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,080
i gain access to your enterprise and

264
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,360
then post access

265
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,279
what happens after i get in

266
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,320
okay now here has been

267
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,440
what you've been doing with bug bounties

268
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,320
and hunting

269
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,720
we're primarily looking at the access

270
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,600
question

271
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,279
this looks at system hardening this

272
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,800
looks at perimeter defense

273
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,760
this is all a question of how do i make

274
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,839
something harder to get into

275
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,680
and there are two axes into that tech

276
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,040
vulnerabilities bugs people and this is

277
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,880
the often overlooked part is the fact

278
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,440
that

279
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,800
people are the i call it the infinite

280
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,160
calculus of people

281
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,080
all of those variables on all of those

282
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,320
different days and the fact that sue did

283
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,519
this and bob did that

284
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,120
leads to that compromise and

285
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,440
that is i think an infinite space there

286
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,279
are an infinite number of ways to gain

287
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,480
access between

288
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,959
either tech or people or sometimes a

289
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:19,760
mixture of both

290
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,200
yeah and so you know getting in

291
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
is is obviously important right and

292
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,560
that's why

293
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,240
bug bounties have become so so widely

294
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,279
used right and

295
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,120
it's it's great it's an awesome

296
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,720
ecosystem

297
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,600
but as we look at things right and you

298
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,880
know miter obviously

299
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,480
is the one that has a common

300
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,720
vulnerability exposure cdes

301
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,720
but then they also have miter attack and

302
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,040
obviously we have the mandatory

303
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,519
slide that you have to have in every

304
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,200
single presentation aren't we legally

305
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,640
required to have this slide

306
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,519
yeah we are sued every time we do a talk

307
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:55,760
and

308
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,720
don't show this slide um so instead of

309
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,120
just

310
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,800
you know showing the slide i actually

311
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,440
did a search there's a total of 184

312
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,000
techniques this is as of the july update

313
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,839
which added sub techniques of course so

314
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:08,320
i'm not

315
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,600
covering sub techniques i'm covering

316
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,839
the techniques and there's 184 of them

317
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,680
and if you just use google and do a

318
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,480
control

319
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,839
find there and look for exploits there's

320
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:20,399
only

321
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,240
six of these 184 that cover exploitation

322
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,399
and only one under initial access right

323
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,000
the exploiting of public

324
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,240
facing applications um there's some

325
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,600
other exploits right for

326
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,680
client execution uh that's your

327
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,200
client-side vulnerabilities

328
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,720
and then you have some exploitation for

329
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,480
privilege escalation defensive agent

330
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,720
credential access and remote services

331
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,720
um which are all important right but

332
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,839
what about all this

333
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,360
other stuff right so if you're in bug

334
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,200
bounty space you're kind of

335
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,720
limited to this initial access type

336
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,320
vulnerabilities and those are great

337
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,839
especially because you get paid

338
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,920
that's awesome um you find those

339
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,519
vulnerabilities you report it to a

340
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,519
vendor the vendor fixes it you are

341
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,440
improving security for everyone

342
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,639
because now everyone has that patch and

343
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,079
and it does it feels awesome right but

344
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,720
if we heard what bryson said we can all

345
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,440
agree that

346
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,160
this is not going to change anytime soon

347
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,920
there is going to be

348
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,560
many many many many ways of view to get

349
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,000
in there's going to be many ways of

350
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,600
finding these vulnerabilities you're

351
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,519
going to find a lot of them obviously as

352
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,880
you all know right

353
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,240
uh but what happens after that right and

354
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,360
if we look at mitre there's initial

355
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,160
access

356
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,120
is one of the tactics out of a number of

357
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,000
tactics

358
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,320
and it only really covers nine

359
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,279
techniques

360
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,839
there's 184 total techniques and that

361
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,760
again not including sub techniques

362
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,800
so what happens after the fact

363
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,279
right and that's where we see that there

364
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,079
is more

365
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,279
of a bound of what you can do and here's

366
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,240
where you're going to find

367
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,760
all of those features right because

368
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,680
if you're not finding a vulnerability

369
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,959
that's exploitable

370
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,959
or these nine that are six that are

371
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,079
there

372
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,360
then they're features right like bits

373
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,920
jobs which is under defensive agent that

374
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,760
is a feature of the windows operating

375
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,720
system right

376
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,920
um and there's a whole bunch more so

377
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,160
this kind of like progresses the

378
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,880
discussion of what a lavas do which was

379
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,160
find vulnerabilities and kind of

380
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,760
prioritize those vulnerabilities and

381
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,279
just make sure we patch them

382
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,839
to the fact that we know at some point

383
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:28,480
someone

384
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,200
bad is going to have an exploit or

385
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,560
someone's going to get phished and

386
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,399
they're going to get inside the network

387
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,120
so what do we do then and i think that's

388
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,920
kind of where

389
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,600
where we're going with this uh

390
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,120
philosophy and

391
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,800
as an industry as a whole so what first

392
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,199
challenge from this presentation miter

393
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,199
attack is not a complete

394
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,680
list it is the most exhaustive

395
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,920
encyclopedia that we have to catalog

396
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,639
a common vernacular for us to talk to

397
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,920
but particularly with

398
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,000
so many wonderful hackers out there

399
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,639
participating in bug crowds

400
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,680
bug bounty programs you have a lot of

401
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,120
opportunities to find

402
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,880
additional techniques that have not been

403
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,720
discovered before and documented

404
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,399
um and so that was what i would say the

405
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,760
first challenge is

406
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,519
um i think it's really cool to see all

407
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,680
of the folks that are going out there

408
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,079
and um finding bounties improving

409
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:20,800
defenses

410
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,760
and making money to do it um personal

411
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,800
challenge here

412
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,440
um i will i am impressed for anybody

413
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,240
that also can

414
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,000
add to this compendium of knowledge that

415
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,600
we all use

416
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,639
so post access this is our world

417
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,000
um bug bounty is around

418
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,920
the access problem but then once you

419
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,000
gain access once you cross

420
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,920
and i deliberately chose a red line

421
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,120
because of my national security

422
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,800
background

423
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,399
once you cross that red line in

424
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,360
the first question every attacker has

425
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,560
this part's animated you're going to

426
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,519
have to slowly click

427
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,000
is where am i attackers don't always get

428
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,160
to choose where they start

429
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,519
this is this is i think one of those

430
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,880
things where everybody sort of has this

431
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,760
view of

432
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,320
of complex operators and like oh i got

433
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,839
exactly where i began

434
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,760
nope most of the time it's you get a

435
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,440
call back and you're like huh

436
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,440
ah that's the computer from that target

437
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,120
i've been working on for two years

438
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,880
if you are doing the real thing or if

439
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880
you're a red team operator it's

440
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,279
probably a little bit more narrowed in

441
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,000
and so you're like

442
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,199
okay where am i based on where i am

443
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,719
where do i want to go

444
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,320
so you start trying to move laterally

445
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,240
you start trying to figure out

446
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,839
where i can go

447
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,560
nope george you knew i was going to show

448
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,440
elon musk's smoking pot again

449
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,199
of course this is a wonderful meme

450
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,360
this represents the disgruntled employee

451
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,759
who's too smart

452
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,160
you don't appreciate me enough i can't

453
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,079
do his accent so i don't i don't try

454
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,240
that's got to be the worst malicious

455
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,199
insider you can

456
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,480
ever have is elon musk and then you try

457
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,279
to pivot from that

458
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,560
yep occasionally you're going to hit a

459
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,959
dead end and then you try to pivot from

460
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,880
that

461
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,120
oh well looks like we found somebody

462
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,639
else that's also operating in here

463
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,199
which by the way does happen and all of

464
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,079
this is

465
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,120
eventually to get to

466
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,880
what's valuable right

467
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,759
so where you start is an unknown but the

468
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:36,000
point

469
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,519
of all this is we're looking for

470
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,279
business context

471
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,279
there are what i call the cga the crown

472
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,480
jewel assets the

473
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,759
most valuable parts of a business i want

474
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,839
to get to those elements

475
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,240
that might be customer information that

476
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,839
might be financial information that

477
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:52,880
might be

478
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,800
services that might be passwords

479
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,480
whatever that is there are

480
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,360
varying values of assets and employees

481
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,880
and i have to figure out once i get

482
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,759
access

483
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,839
how do i get to them

484
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,319
and that is really the focus right when

485
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,799
we do offensive work right it's always

486
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,959
about bringing business value so

487
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,240
uh you know finding those

488
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,599
vulnerabilities obviously that's

489
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,400
important

490
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,319
getting them patched is really where the

491
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,240
business value is right the business

492
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,760
value isn't finding the vulnerability

493
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,480
per se

494
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,880
but actually remediating it and and

495
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,039
stopping what what could possibly

496
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,559
um happen next and so there's two axes

497
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,240
in this post access world

498
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,880
communications i have to be able to talk

499
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,720
over the wires that are there to get to

500
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,760
what i want

501
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,919
um i need to do that internally i need

502
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,600
to do that externally because i have to

503
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,480
drive

504
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,679
the control of the implant campaign

505
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,640
and then capabilities my software my

506
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,240
malware my implant

507
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,640
my payload needs to be able to do

508
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,919
certain things

509
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,039
um maybe i need to for example

510
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,280
first question where am i let's look

511
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,320
locally

512
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,120
let's be active or passive with

513
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,960
reconning the network to understand

514
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,360
what's around me start mapping out that

515
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,760
network

516
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,880
then how do i get to those places do i

517
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,480
need to masquerade do i need to steal

518
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,400
credentials what other applications are

519
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:18,960
running

520
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,559
what are the things that i need to do to

521
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,400
be able to leapfrog to where i want to

522
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:22,880
get

523
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,160
and so you're going to do that across

524
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,240
these two axes i need to be able to talk

525
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,360
and then i'm going to have certain

526
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,959
abilities to accomplish certain things

527
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,840
now this is tying it back into what's

528
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,440
called the cyber defense matrix

529
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,799
uh which it was uh created by sunil yu

530
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,960
and let's say he debuted that at rsa in

531
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,600
2017

532
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,120
um and he broke the

533
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,640
the way to look at everything into five

534
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,559
categories the three that are relevant

535
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,120
to us

536
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,360
is that most bug bounties are primarily

537
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,840
looking at protection

538
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,720
how do i keep access out how do i make

539
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,080
this system

540
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,720
as impenetrable as i can because as we

541
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,600
all know

542
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,280
this is where the money's made nothing

543
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,120
is unhackable

544
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,919
but the post access world actually is

545
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:12,640
three

546
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,720
levels not only do i have to look at

547
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,720
protection in depth because each one of

548
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,440
those systems

549
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,000
needs to be protected and while we all

550
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,240
know that the perimeter defense concept

551
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,000
is invalid you still find a lot of

552
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,720
hard walls with a lot of easy insides

553
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,840
once you get inside

554
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,559
because users are trusted and all i have

555
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,960
to do is look like a user as an attacker

556
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,799
but then the primary two components that

557
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,559
are new are the detection and the

558
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,760
response

559
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,240
so the one place an attacker can't hide

560
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,320
is on the wire

561
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,160
on the wire i have to go to ones and

562
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,600
zeros like everybody else

563
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,520
i can't beat the laws of physics i have

564
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,520
to use your communication protocols

565
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,360
because otherwise i stick out like a

566
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,000
sore thumb any junior soccer analyst

567
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,600
will be able to find me

568
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,320
so i put on the sheep's cloak the

569
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,520
sheep's clothing

570
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,799
and i hide but i can't

571
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,600
be invisible on a host i can be

572
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,480
invisible

573
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,640
on a host i know where you're looking

574
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,640
for me and what you're looking for

575
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,400
that's just a part of my test matrix

576
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,480
before i deploy my malware

577
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,960
so part of this is how do we refine

578
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,480
those detections because

579
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,679
if you're thinking about it from a stock

580
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,520
analyst perspective they've got all of

581
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,440
these great bug bounty programs from

582
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,320
bug crowd that's keeping as much out as

583
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,120
possible

584
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,679
but when it gets in how do i make sure

585
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,679
that i'm looking at the minimal amount

586
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:34,720
of traffic

587
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,280
so that i can quickly identify anomalous

588
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,080
behavior

589
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,400
and then now we're measuring response

590
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,080
what's the ability of the tools

591
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,840
and that staff to be able to find that

592
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:49,840
behavior as quickly as possible

593
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,200
yeah and that's you know the

594
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,360
communication is so important because

595
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,200
if you look at it from an adversary

596
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,520
perspective if you don't have

597
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,039
the communication channel and that's

598
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,840
kind of the focus of the command control

599
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,200
matrix right the c2 matrix is you have

600
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,320
to write a worm

601
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,240
and a worm is going to act based on

602
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,080
whatever it finds and yes you can

603
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,280
automate all of that we're actually

604
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,280
pretty good at doing some of that stuff

605
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,400
but that communication back really

606
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,320
really is important like very rarely

607
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,840
will you go in blind

608
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,799
um and and try to move laterally and do

609
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,400
all this work without knowing and of

610
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,520
course we've seen

611
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,600
many worms what has happened with them

612
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,360
right and obviously sucks and it's

613
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,000
probably the

614
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,240
the one that comes to mind first as you

615
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,080
know it was a worm it had to be a worm

616
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,720
because it was

617
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,880
air gap network but eventually that got

618
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,919
out and

619
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,840
it just really goes to show the the

620
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,080
importance of communication

621
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,520
uh for your malware so one of the things

622
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,640
we want to cover

623
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,840
is lowbass right and that's living off

624
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,559
the land binaries and scripts and

625
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,880
really to to define this it's a project

626
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,960
and i'll live demo it for you in in a

627
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,320
second and

628
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,679
these are your original

629
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,360
it's not a bug it's a feature

630
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,640
uh item right so to be a low bass

631
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,039
um these are windows focus by the way

632
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,159
they are

633
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,880
um they have to be microsoft signed and

634
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,159
what does that mean that means that

635
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,480
microsoft has to actually sign the code

636
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,039
which is great because your operating

637
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,960
system will run it without any problems

638
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,240
even if you put you know application uh

639
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,320
allow listing or application controls

640
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,520
and things like that because they're

641
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,960
part of the operating system they're

642
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,120
required to run

643
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,880
and then the other option is that they

644
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,240
need to be either native to the

645
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,840
operating system so they come

646
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,880
with your operating system or they can

647
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,120
be downloaded by microsoft such as the

648
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,280
windows internals project which i know

649
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,480
many of you use

650
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,520
like sysmon or processmod or

651
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,840
psx right there's a ton of these and

652
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,640
that was uh

653
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,960
originally created by mark rosonovic and

654
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,440
then purchased by microsoft and he's now

655
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,880
um i believe he's cto for azure

656
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,120
um and really the thing here is that

657
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,159
they need to have

658
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,840
an extra unexpected functionality right

659
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,120
that's the feature

660
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,520
stuff um and this is great because it

661
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,960
does let you get around these

662
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,000
application

663
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,080
uh controls and i apologize i used the

664
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,120
word application

665
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,679
listing there which i uh we have

666
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:24,559
modified we

667
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,360
call it application control application

668
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,960
allow listing so

669
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,240
my bad on that typo um and they also

670
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,919
need to have some sort of functionality

671
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,120
that would be useful for

672
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,919
an adversary or a red team and currently

673
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,720
we have

674
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,559
119 of these documented so i'm going to

675
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,000
show you this in a second but

676
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,840
the first one of the very simple

677
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,320
examples here is run

678
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,480
dll32 right this comes with the windows

679
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,799
operating system it's required

680
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,360
it's used by windows to execute dlls

681
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,799
where dlls dynamic

682
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,320
link libraries this is shared code

683
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,080
pretty much like you don't want to have

684
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,799
to rewrite things that maybe microsoft

685
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,640
already wrote for their operating system

686
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,520
the function

687
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,640
so instead you load dlls

688
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,360
and the way to do that is with uh run

689
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,080
dll

690
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,240
so uh shout out to all the folks that

691
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,400
found this uh casey smith you will find

692
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,200
on a lum

693
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,400
number of these low bins um casey's with

694
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,360
uh red canary and they do some awesome

695
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,159
stuff there like

696
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,159
atomic red team and things like that um

697
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,360
but other uh

698
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,200
contributors there shout out to all of

699
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,760
you and the work that you've done here

700
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,520
and on the right side again these are

701
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,440
just screenshots from

702
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,559
the actual uh entry and

703
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,320
you can execute this in a number of ways

704
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,720
for example you can create a dll

705
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,480
in the first example up here you created

706
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,720
a deal called all the things

707
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,200
x64 and you just run dll32.exe again

708
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,960
it's assigned binary it's part of the

709
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,640
operating system and you have to be able

710
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,440
to run this

711
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,360
there is no protection at this point

712
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,600
because it's just a feature

713
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,120
and then you give it the entry point of

714
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,360
your dll so um we'll we'll do a live

715
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,880
demo here in a bit and

716
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,320
show you exactly how to do that i'm

717
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,720
gonna i've already created the dll just

718
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,159
in the interest of time but i'm gonna

719
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:12,799
show you how

720
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,320
simple it is uh to do that um

721
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,120
so let me let's get to a live demo

722
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,799
because i know you all like live demos

723
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,000
so low bass

724
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,799
dash project.github.io i'm going to

725
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,720
paste it over here in the discord so you

726
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,600
all see it

727
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,559
and um here you can see search among 119

728
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,640
binaries by name

729
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,600
or you can look here so 80 this is the

730
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,080
old

731
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,039
school's uh scheduled uh task scheduler

732
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:39,840
in windows

733
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,679
um you can see the functions is to

734
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,919
execute and it's a binary

735
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,000
we can click on it and here's where you

736
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,760
kind of see what we just saw you see the

737
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,559
path there

738
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,200
um you can just execute it with a t and

739
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,799
down here it tells you exactly how to

740
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:53,919
create in this case you're going to

741
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,600
create a

742
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,679
scheduled task and tell it what you want

743
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,840
it to execute right so

744
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,919
doing this isn't really malicious it's

745
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,000
just part of how the operating system

746
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,760
works and this is kind of where

747
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,679
bryson mentioned the whole detection

748
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,039
part and that's where we have to get

749
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,240
good at we

750
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,600
aren't going to be able to stop this

751
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,360
right maybe you can stop the schedule

752
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,400
task service

753
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,480
but someone might be able to start it

754
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,320
and then they can create a task

755
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,480
nowadays we have a bunch of tasks

756
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,840
running especially if you're on windows

757
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,480
10 so

758
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,200
what can you do to detect this well it's

759
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,799
going to depend on what your business

760
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:27,279
does

761
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,240
and how they do schedule tests like if

762
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:30,880
they use

763
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,400
that then you're going to have to

764
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,159
monitor and make sure that new scheduled

765
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,440
tasks might not be created

766
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,919
or if it is why and it was it created

767
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:38,720
remotely

768
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,520
is it running interactively and i don't

769
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,640
know those answers

770
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,640
i can show you how and right here we

771
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,320
have this detection part where it tells

772
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:46,559
you

773
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,400
what you can do it tells you what event

774
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,320
log to look at but this is where we have

775
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,520
to test because

776
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,120
once you find that vulnerability you're

777
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,720
going to exploit it you're going to

778
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,679
execute code

779
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,600
and then what do you do afterwards well

780
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,520
scheduled tasks we know is one of the

781
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,760
miter uh attack techniques right and

782
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,520
there's a whole bunch of these right we

783
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,600
got bash.exe now thanks to

784
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,000
windows there's bits admin which is its

785
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,200
own technique as well

786
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,480
you can see over here on the right

787
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,960
there's multitude of different functions

788
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,840
uh and whatnot and yeah i forgot to turn

789
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,840
off my discord notifications so

790
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,760
there's someone talking there um but you

791
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,279
can see a number of these and of course

792
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,679
we're we're going to talk about run dll

793
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:24,960
there's a screenshot i showed you but

794
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,880
look at how many ways you can use run

795
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,840
dll

796
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,880
really a great great uh

797
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,200
tool to use but at the end of the day

798
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,919
this only covers

799
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,760
execution right we looked at miter

800
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,640
attack

801
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,919
and the whole thing like execution is

802
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,440
only 10 techniques

803
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,760
right we could probably fit this under a

804
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,440
defensive asian as well you have the

805
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,960
bits job there that i mentioned that's

806
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,240
what bits admin

807
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,279
um but again we're still only focused on

808
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,919
a couple of things right like what about

809
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,919
persistence privilege escalation

810
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,240
credential access discovery

811
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,240
lateral movement command and control

812
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,679
like that's really

813
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,080
where you want to make sure that that

814
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,200
you're testing and

815
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,399
and getting things uh going so um i'll

816
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:11,120
get to the

817
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,520
the demo shortly i want to uh just do a

818
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,960
quick intro here for

819
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,159
site and um bryson we definitely need to

820
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,000
make like a little marketing video of

821
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,840
all the different ways of pronouncing

822
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,039
our company name

823
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,960
because i've noticed that as we talk to

824
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,320
people from different countries

825
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,279
everyone has a different um different

826
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,159
way of pronouncing

827
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,080
it which is great i mean it's completely

828
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,919
fine at least you know what the product

829
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,200
is and what it does

830
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,919
um and it is an awesome product and i'm

831
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,520
not just saying that because i'm the cto

832
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,159
here now

833
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,120
but we did actually use this before i

834
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,159
came over and

835
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,159
and saw and really what it is is an

836
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,240
enterprise grade platform for

837
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,039
adversary emulation so we did the c2

838
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,600
matrix we we have 54 command and control

839
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,480
frameworks right

840
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,399
but only five of those are commercial

841
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,960
and be hesitant to running a number of

842
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,399
those in production

843
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,440
because they're open source and do you

844
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,120
really trust the code you see on the

845
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,000
internet

846
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,840
maybe you do maybe you don't that's your

847
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,080
decision to make but in this case

848
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,399
we are a organization that is giving you

849
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,240
an enterprise grade platform

850
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,960
and it runs in production we really

851
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,240
believe in testing the stuff in

852
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,360
production right so

853
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,559
a lot of people are going to say oh we

854
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,240
should test this in non-production

855
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,000
that's great to train people

856
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,640
but your security controls are in

857
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,440
production

858
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,520
so that's where we want to test and we

859
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,919
want to test the post exploitation stuff

860
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:32,240
so

861
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,919
you might have heard the term assume

862
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,640
breach that is what we believe in right

863
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,520
like

864
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,760
bug bounty and all you folks on here

865
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,039
that are awesome at finding these

866
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,799
vulnerabilities you're not going to stop

867
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:43,919
finding vulnerabilities

868
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,440
you're going to find them all the time

869
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,120
right so

870
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,240
let you focus on that well we focus

871
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,880
on giving you a platform and a framework

872
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,360
to do

873
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,000
everything after that initial access and

874
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,880
that's really

875
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,360
what we're here and what we want to uh

876
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,320
propose

877
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,799
uh for you i'm not sure bryce if you had

878
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:03,360
any

879
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,960
any comments or you like my marketing

880
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,279
idea of the video

881
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,240
um i i look forward to uh the scythe

882
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,320
platform reflecting even more george

883
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,520
and uh we always wear the props so uh

884
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,799
there you go so you can actually

885
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,520
see what a scythe is because it's a real

886
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,440
word we didn't make it up

887
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,240
that is right it is a real world so one

888
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,520
of the things that

889
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,919
um when scythe was created and really

890
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:30,640
what

891
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,640
what it is it's modular right it's a

892
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,760
framework

893
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,559
where you can build on top of and

894
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,480
building on top of that is really where

895
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,480
all of you come in and where the

896
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,720
community and the call to action comes

897
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,440
right so

898
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,679
as an industry i think we've we've

899
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,159
covered the fact that you want to

900
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,880
evolve from only focusing on

901
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,320
vulnerabilities and patching it right

902
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,120
i'm not saying

903
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,600
don't do that that's extremely important

904
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,960
we will continue to do that

905
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,200
but then what happens next right what

906
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,799
happens after that well

907
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,279
we release sites for version 3.1 at

908
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,960
blackhand defcon hopefully you caught

909
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,480
some of the talks

910
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,320
and we have a number of differentiators

911
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,159
here i saw one of

912
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,559
on the ctf walkthrough lots of python

913
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:13,440
was covered

914
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,799
so when you deploy i'm going to show you

915
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:17,600
how to deploy

916
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,760
scythe with run dll32 one of the low

917
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,720
passes

918
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,840
you have a python in memory runtime that

919
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,640
means

920
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,360
you execute any way that you want and

921
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,480
then in memory

922
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,960
you can bring in this runtime which

923
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,880
means that anything you write in python

924
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,360
can also be executed on the systems you

925
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:35,919
have

926
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,640
confirmed uh you've compromised uh we

927
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,640
also have a virtual file system so

928
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,080
um it's a red team tool and you know

929
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,559
half the word is team so we kind of need

930
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,399
teams to work together so a virtual file

931
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,080
system will allow you to share files

932
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,799
together

933
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,880
and really this is good for red teaming

934
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,640
and purple team exercises

935
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,320
and then we have the threat automation

936
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,679
language and this is where i mentioned

937
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:58,159
we can

938
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,399
emulate and really put things together

939
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:01,519
in an attack chain

940
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,039
where you're not just getting access to

941
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,559
a system but then

942
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,640
it can run a command and based on that

943
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,159
command can do other actions so for

944
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,919
example you land on the system

945
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,600
you want to see if you're on a domain if

946
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,120
you are on the domain then you want to

947
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,080
pull all the users

948
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,840
on the domain but if you're not on the

949
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,000
domain why would you try to execute

950
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,720
something

951
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,559
that pulls all the users in the domain

952
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,640
when that doesn't actually

953
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,240
exist right so our architecture

954
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,480
um really and what we want to focus on

955
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,600
is on the left side here it's a

956
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,279
marketplace in the community where

957
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,679
we're releasing an sdk it's released

958
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:34,960
right now you can download it i'll cover

959
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,840
that in a second

960
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,240
and you can create your own capabilities

961
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:38,880
so

962
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,120
you're doing your bug bounty you find

963
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,159
some vulnerability

964
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,440
they tell you no that's actually a

965
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,440
feature of the product you say okay

966
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,440
since you're not going to pay me let me

967
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,480
create this

968
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,360
as a module for post exploitation and

969
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,120
you can do that through a marketplace

970
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,640
that we're launching and launched last

971
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,360
week so

972
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,440
you're you're one of the first hearing

973
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,279
and then from there anyone that uses

974
00:32:59,279 --> 00:32:59,919
site

975
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,039
can create a attack chain

976
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,760
emulating whichever attacker um they

977
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,880
would like to emulate

978
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,200
they create the campaign they deploy it

979
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,000
and it runs

980
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,760
through automation and then you do all

981
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,200
the other checks right you

982
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,000
do real time analysis with the sock you

983
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,279
can see analytics

984
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,159
um it does integrations with splunk and

985
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:20,559
with

986
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,240
um phantom with a really anything that

987
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,000
has syslog and things like that

988
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,320
so really where where we want to focus

989
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,360
on here is on this

990
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,440
left side where where you as a

991
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,080
marketplace and community can create

992
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,200
these um this ecosystem so this

993
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,799
ecosystem so what we did is

994
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,720
we created a marketplace and that

995
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,360
marketplace is a secure ecosystem so you

996
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,559
do have to register

997
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,720
in it um and think of it like an app

998
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,880
store like the google play store right

999
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,440
anyone can create apps for it anyone

1000
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,080
could purchase

1001
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,240
an app some apps are free some are not

1002
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,760
and there's an sdk

1003
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,919
exactly what happens here we have all of

1004
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,679
those we've created the backend

1005
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,760
infrastructure which is this marketplace

1006
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,559
and then you as a developer you can

1007
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,960
create these modules and that allows

1008
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,879
really for the timing to be a lot

1009
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,079
quicker because now

1010
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,280
customers don't have to wait for the

1011
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,280
next version of site to come out to be

1012
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,719
able to test something they can actually

1013
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,679
create it or

1014
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,800
read some new thread intel emulate it

1015
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,760
and create this module and then you can

1016
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,679
share it and it's going to be bug bounty

1017
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,879
friendly and we actually

1018
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,960
have some bounties today that we're

1019
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,918
going to announce

1020
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,239
uh in a little bit so how do you do this

1021
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,599
there's an sdk

1022
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,760
and anyone could build modules you don't

1023
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,280
need psych to build a module

1024
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,839
you download the sdk from github uh the

1025
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,679
link is right there

1026
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,000
um we'll we'll post it uh here on the on

1027
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,040
the discord

1028
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,760
and whether you know python or you know

1029
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,119
native code we have

1030
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,199
mac linux and windows so you can create

1031
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,918
um code there natively or with python

1032
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,000
and then you use this gui called module

1033
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,440
buster which is pretty cool

1034
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,000
you create these apps uh these modules

1035
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,480
and

1036
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,320
then you can share those you can share

1037
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,520
through the app store or

1038
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,240
you can post the code online there is

1039
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,240
absolutely no gatekeeping here

1040
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,079
you can do what you want with your code

1041
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,000
you can sell it in the app store and

1042
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,960
in our marketplace and you can sell it

1043
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,680
outside

1044
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,599
you can sideload it you don't have to

1045
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:18,800
jailbreak anything

1046
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,760
uh for that to work so um here's a

1047
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,160
snapshot of it marketplace.site.io

1048
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,200
is up and ready so for example

1049
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,880
chromecracker chromecracker is a

1050
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,040
module that once you get access to a

1051
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,720
system and again user level privilege

1052
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,480
you don't need to be system or ru or

1053
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,280
anything like that

1054
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,359
you can actually steal passwords that

1055
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,040
have been saved with google chrome right

1056
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,720
i know none of you do that

1057
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,880
but a lot of people save passwords in

1058
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,800
chrome and you can pull those out it

1059
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,960
extracts them it cracks them for you it

1060
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,119
it extracts a key and shows you the

1061
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,960
password uh you can also do that with

1062
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,680
cookies

1063
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,520
there's error scan which goes through a

1064
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,760
system and finds yara rules jar is a

1065
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,320
method

1066
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,680
of identifying and detecting various

1067
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,960
things

1068
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,320
and we also have let me out which is a

1069
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,280
method to

1070
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,800
test egress uh control so for example

1071
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,160
you want to see if this particular

1072
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,960
organization blocks ssh outbound or ftp

1073
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,040
outbound you can test that and that one

1074
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,320
shout out to mubix

1075
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,240
uh rob fuller from black hills

1076
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,440
information security

1077
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,280
let us use that code and port it over

1078
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,119
because it was a python script

1079
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,079
and now you can bring any python here to

1080
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,680
to the marketplace so

1081
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,839
why does this all matter well the whole

1082
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:34,000
it's not vulnerability is a feature

1083
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,599
right i'm sure you've all heard this

1084
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,880
before so next time you do hear that

1085
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,240
you don't actually have to just say oh

1086
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,720
this all this work was for nothing you

1087
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,480
can actually create a module

1088
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,400
and then share the module i mean you

1089
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,839
already did the work so you can share

1090
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:50,640
for free

1091
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,119
or you can sell it now how much is it

1092
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,079
going to go for we have

1093
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,240
no idea this is like the beginning of

1094
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,119
bug bounty

1095
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,359
when we did not know how much bugs would

1096
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,839
go for this is exactly what we're doing

1097
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:02,480
again

1098
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,440
but for tcps and at the end of the day

1099
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,520
these ttps aren't going to be prevented

1100
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,079
because they're features so really we

1101
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,680
want to put this in the hands of

1102
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,200
organizations so they can test

1103
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,240
themselves

1104
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,400
and then see what they can do if they

1105
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,079
can detect that in any way

1106
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,920
another reason is community right we're

1107
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,599
building something new you've already

1108
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,359
built an amazing community

1109
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:26,240
uh with bug crowd right it's fantastic

1110
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,280
uh

1111
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,599
where this has gone right from the early

1112
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:30,480
days when

1113
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,760
we were uh pretty much uh you know

1114
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,640
getting bullied online for for releasing

1115
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,920
information about

1116
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,160
vulnerabilities in in systems but it was

1117
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,079
because no one was listening to us right

1118
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,520
all the way through to where we are

1119
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,520
today where companies are actively

1120
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,240
asking us

1121
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,000
to find vulnerabilities on their systems

1122
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,640
i think we will be able to do the same

1123
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,320
in ttps right where we are evolving

1124
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:59,520
from cves uh to ttps

1125
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,480
so uh let's uh

1126
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,640
should we do a demo or you want to cover

1127
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,240
bounties first no let's let's jump into

1128
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,040
the demo while

1129
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,880
you're quick pulling that up um so we

1130
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,079
talked about setting up community i

1131
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,440
think it was really neat

1132
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,760
and completely coincidental that we were

1133
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,240
after the previous panel that was

1134
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,640
talking about diversity because

1135
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,160
securities strength comes from diversity

1136
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,440
and diversity is more than just

1137
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,760
race or gender or socioeconomic

1138
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,640
background i mean

1139
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,359
all of those different factors that make

1140
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:34,000
somebody

1141
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,079
individually um who they are

1142
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,200
gives them a unique vantage point and

1143
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,040
all too often in security it is our

1144
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,040
assumptions that kill us

1145
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,079
and the more different voice that you

1146
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:48,640
can have

1147
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,119
in that room to look and think about

1148
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:51,839
something

1149
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,760
the more likely it is that we are going

1150
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,720
to build a stronger and safer system

1151
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,880
and ecosystem and so that's all we're

1152
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,079
trying to do with the community

1153
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,359
in the post access world

1154
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,079
exactly so um so yeah kind of going back

1155
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,599
to run dll

1156
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:11,119
um and how that is this is scythe um

1157
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,960
if you haven't seen it before like i

1158
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,400
said it's an enterprise

1159
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,000
uh c2 we get to create and

1160
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
multiple people can log into here and

1161
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,359
you have campaigns

1162
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,480
so creating a campaign is so easy

1163
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,200
like literally we'll call this level up

1164
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,000
and you can create

1165
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,680
a campaign here your communication

1166
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,920
channels like dns google sheets

1167
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,359
http https smb for lateral movement

1168
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:36,000
stego

1169
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,920
twitter and you like literally just

1170
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,280
click through this and can

1171
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,079
do things like steal from the clipboard

1172
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:42,800
just by

1173
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,800
clicking it's literally legos and of

1174
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,800
course you have miter attack mapping

1175
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,760
there

1176
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,760
you also have miter attack techniques

1177
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,040
here that you can choose

1178
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,520
from the actual matrix itself and and

1179
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,880
choose different things but

1180
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,119
um the point here is is none of that

1181
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,000
it's here i've uh i've already created

1182
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,079
a a listener this is http to a domain

1183
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,000
this doesn't do anything this just

1184
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,480
connects and establishes that connection

1185
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,040
um and what i did in this case is i

1186
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,960
created a dll right because that's a

1187
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,240
little bit

1188
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,680
so um to create a dll we uh

1189
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,839
we just download it it's it's this

1190
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,560
simple you go here download 64 bit dll

1191
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,400
and there it tells you the entry point

1192
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,680
because if you recall

1193
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,599
a dll you actually have to tell it where

1194
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:28,880
in the dll to

1195
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,960
to run so i have another system over

1196
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,000
here uh

1197
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,280
it's poor windows 10 victim that's

1198
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,920
constantly getting hacked oh my gosh

1199
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,359
what happened did it just

1200
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,680
get updated yes it got updated so

1201
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,480
awesome

1202
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,599
um we will do a live demo and

1203
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,200
hopefully windows defender doesn't catch

1204
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,640
anything because

1205
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,280
it just got updated so um i've already

1206
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,079
downloaded

1207
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,599
uh this file here https domain

1208
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,520
see i downloaded it just a little bit

1209
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,839
before here so print to the demo guides

1210
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:03,680
run dll32.exe

1211
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,440
right just a standard command prompt i'm

1212
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,720
a standard user

1213
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,400
i'm going to tell it to run this and

1214
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,040
then um i'm going to grab

1215
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,240
that initial um

1216
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,400
the initial entry point function name

1217
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,000
and i mean we can

1218
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,680
see this here in the law best right like

1219
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,920
it's exactly how this works

1220
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,920
um and again map to miter attack t1085

1221
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,440
so we paste that in there we hit enter

1222
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,920
and then it should just go out and

1223
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,520
communicate nothing pops up

1224
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,280
nothing occurs here but when we go

1225
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,480
over to our our site system here we see

1226
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,760
windows 1001

1227
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,160
we now have an active shell it has its

1228
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,640
own process id for 376. and as i

1229
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,079
mentioned this doesn't really do

1230
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,920
anything it it does give you a shell

1231
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,319
though um so we can see here

1232
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,800
um what we can do with this particular

1233
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,079
shell just like you would

1234
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,160
any other post exploitation tool right

1235
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,200
but at this point

1236
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,359
we're pretty much just establishing that

1237
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,280
connection so we did execution with a

1238
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,240
low bass

1239
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,200
um windows just got updated and and it

1240
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,800
did not catch this

1241
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,800
this particular system so that's that's

1242
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,400
always nice to see

1243
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,800
um but yeah this is this is how simple

1244
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,560
it is right so it's a zoom breach

1245
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,319
we already have access to a particular

1246
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,640
system we can execute whatever we want

1247
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,839
here

1248
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,440
and um and and we execute it just like

1249
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,680
it told us run dll32 and then the name

1250
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,720
of the dll

1251
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,880
and the starting point and bam iran's

1252
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,119
and we can run it multiple times right

1253
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,599
um we can then close this down if we

1254
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,280
look over here in task manager for

1255
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,000
instance

1256
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,040
like there is no run dll32 there

1257
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,079
there's a run dll32 this is what uh what

1258
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,079
we have executed and you see it's a very

1259
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:46,640
small

1260
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,079
footprint uh very low power usage and

1261
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:53,119
it's there and it's active here we go

1262
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,000
back wheel

1263
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,760
we'll see up there are the two active

1264
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,760
connections and and we now have a

1265
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,480
command and control uh channel

1266
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,440
established so

1267
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,520
this is this is just one example of

1268
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,480
execution

1269
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,800
really what we want to focus on is after

1270
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,160
the fact right and

1271
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,720
what do you do next after you you create

1272
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,359
this so

1273
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,040
um there's a number of things and i

1274
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,040
mentioned you can create a lot of

1275
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,480
different automation so

1276
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,720
for example i was looking at bot trap

1277
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,480
the other day ball trap is a russian

1278
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,520
threat actor

1279
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,760
and they do a lot of collection so i

1280
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,880
created this particular uh

1281
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,359
thread and what it does is it key logs

1282
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:30,720
it takes a screenshot

1283
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,119
it steals from the clipboard right so

1284
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,200
every time you copy and paste it can

1285
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,359
steal from there it gets this info runs

1286
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:38,400
who am i

1287
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,319
and uh dumps the key logger and things

1288
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:41,839
like that and each week

1289
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:44,560
um we do these things called threat

1290
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,920
thursdays

1291
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,160
but we really bring all this together um

1292
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,920
the last one i did was evil corp

1293
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,480
so many of you heard of the garmin hack

1294
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,200
right

1295
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,440
if you've used garmin before you

1296
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,640
probably saw that

1297
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,599
they were down for a week um everything

1298
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:00,800
was down as you can see on the

1299
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,560
screenshot here

1300
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,640
and what i did is i looked at some

1301
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,480
thread intel ncc group but

1302
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,160
shout out to them i think someone

1303
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,680
mentioned that they work there so

1304
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,119
uh excellent excellent uh cti there

1305
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:15,440
so i pretty much reviewed this entire

1306
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,760
post and they did not map this

1307
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,560
to mitre attack so um i did the manual

1308
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,280
mapping

1309
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,079
kind of high level what it did and then

1310
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,440
we emulated it

1311
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,000
uh here and actually created a navigator

1312
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,160
layer just for this particular thread

1313
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:30,720
actor

1314
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,720
that you can see here everything that it

1315
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,960
did everything that's in red

1316
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,079
and then of course we create the actual

1317
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,200
um threat um doing all of these

1318
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,640
particular techniques

1319
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,800
uh here's this one in particular which

1320
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,079
um you can do

1321
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,400
and emulate ransomware uh this was my

1322
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,720
defcon talk this year on on how to do

1323
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,440
that without

1324
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,480
uh getting sued or uh

1325
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,319
or really bringing down a system right

1326
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,240
and actually doing illegal things

1327
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,119
so um so yeah we we do this every um

1328
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:02,839
every week again just giving back to the

1329
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:04,160
community um

1330
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,800
all of this is done through github and

1331
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,359
you know

1332
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,920
it's not just about testing but also

1333
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,520
about creating these modules

1334
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,920
that can now do other things and that's

1335
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,880
kind of where we were

1336
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,839
leading up to now um for this next part

1337
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:20,640
of the presentation

1338
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,000
yeah so in terms of uh helping build

1339
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:24,880
community

1340
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,319
we already have some bounties out there

1341
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,960
we are putting up bounties for uh

1342
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,880
communication modules

1343
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,119
so if you think about all modules as

1344
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:36,000
legos

1345
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,599
on how you can be an apt

1346
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,920
we have four communication modules that

1347
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,200
we are looking for

1348
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,480
and then we already have a an offer from

1349
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,920
grim that they're going to

1350
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,160
commit five thousand dollars into this

1351
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,839
and then we actually have another one

1352
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:53,680
which we can't announce now for

1353
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,000
um even more and we're expecting more

1354
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,520
coming and then keep in mind that these

1355
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,800
are just the bounties

1356
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,240
uh we also have multiple enterprise

1357
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,119
customers

1358
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,640
who are looking in this space for

1359
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,560
all sorts of different things so if they

1360
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,240
see something um

1361
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,280
they're also going to be jumping on it

1362
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,960
yeah we got an awesome question here

1363
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,480
from uh codingo

1364
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,079
shout out to you great question how do

1365
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,240
you manage the bounties if more than one

1366
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,000
person works on an item well

1367
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,400
again this is an ecosystem so there

1368
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,400
should be competition just like

1369
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,079
you know again we're just putting the

1370
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:29,680
infrastructure out there

1371
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,119
you're all going to determine what this

1372
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,480
is and our enterprise customers are

1373
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,000
going to determine the price around it

1374
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,400
this is our just ballpark figure of what

1375
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,240
we think that this will cost

1376
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,440
um so pretty much for these bounties

1377
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,160
um the ones that come in and work we

1378
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:44,800
will pay

1379
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,280
on a first come first serve but for

1380
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:47,839
others

1381
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:50,000
it's going to be an app store so if you

1382
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,560
create this particular module you can

1383
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,520
sell it on the store and multiple people

1384
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,319
can have

1385
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:57,760
a module that does exactly the same

1386
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,680
thing right like if you think of various

1387
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,800
different apps on

1388
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,680
on the apple store or the google play

1389
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,640
store right like

1390
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,240
there's multiple apps that do exactly

1391
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,920
the same thing it'll just be based on

1392
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,720
which one

1393
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,040
people use there will be a rating system

1394
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,440
there will also be a bounty system where

1395
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,920
uh someone can go in there and ask for

1396
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,680
something in particular

1397
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,000
and then based on on your submission but

1398
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,839
uh for now pretty much what we've done

1399
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:22,319
is

1400
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,319
a lot of friends and people in the

1401
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:25,839
industry um

1402
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:27,920
from you know major consulting companies

1403
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,040
i'm sure you've heard of

1404
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,720
um have kind of just been working with

1405
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,559
me telling me hey we're working on this

1406
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:33,599
and we're working on this

1407
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:36,400
i've kind of just figured out what

1408
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,920
people are working on and make sure that

1409
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,680
there's no overlap

1410
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,319
but eventually we we want to be hands

1411
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:42,960
off and

1412
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,960
again this is all community we are

1413
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,440
making absolutely nothing out of this

1414
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,119
uh whatever you sell your module for

1415
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,520
i think we charged like five percent

1416
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,160
which

1417
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,559
is just to cover the back end

1418
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:57,599
infrastructure like

1419
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,319
everything is yours this is not uh like

1420
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,480
apple or anything like that taking 30

1421
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,760
or anything like that we want to make

1422
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,160
this

1423
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:09,599
open right and and we are not apple

1424
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,079
we will not apple you i think that was

1425
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:12,640
the uh

1426
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,400
one of the best quotes for unicorn last

1427
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,680
week um

1428
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,680
so yeah so this is out there this is

1429
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,119
awesome news you're hearing about it

1430
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:20,000
first we'll

1431
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,240
obviously go out and uh let others know

1432
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,400
but uh we figured that you are the

1433
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,800
target audience for this because

1434
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,960
uh you know about all of this and you've

1435
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,559
already found some cool

1436
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:33,359
stuff out there so um the bounties are

1437
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,599
for communication channels

1438
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,440
you can create both communication and

1439
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,760
capabilities as uh bryson mentioned

1440
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,359
earlier and we're looking for these in

1441
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:43,520
particular so modbus communication

1442
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,119
channel as you can imagine industrial

1443
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,079
control systems

1444
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,079
and bryson who is the founder of the

1445
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:50,000
industrial control system village

1446
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,200
um has co-founder co-founder co-founder

1447
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,319
um has uh you know various reasons

1448
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,839
why that would be a great idea to have

1449
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:03,040
uh dns over https is being enabled by

1450
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,880
all of your browsers whether you know or

1451
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,119
not same with http 2

1452
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,760
and things that probably you're not

1453
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,440
looking at right and your organizations

1454
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,359
aren't looking at dns over http because

1455
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:14,640
it's a new protocol

1456
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,760
um and then the last one's office 365 as

1457
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,480
everyone moves here um we've seen a

1458
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,280
couple of

1459
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,280
decent proof of concepts but not

1460
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,280
anything concrete on that

1461
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,440
as we mentioned we have uh google sheets

1462
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,960
for command and control which was used

1463
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:29,280
by

1464
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,160
carbonac one of the fin groups i think

1465
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,440
they're fin seven

1466
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,280
we haven't agreed as the industry if

1467
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,480
they're the same thing but

1468
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,839
um now we want office 365. so um

1469
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,079
those are available here you heard it

1470
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:42,960
first

1471
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,440
uh in this debut and this presentation

1472
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,119
was the first time we do it so

1473
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:50,559
um if you're interested um check out the

1474
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:51,359
marketplace

1475
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,680
and really how to get started um it's

1476
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,680
very simple you download the sdk which i

1477
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:56,960
posted there it's free

1478
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,880
you set up your dev environment um

1479
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,960
currently it's windows environment

1480
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,960
and then you write uh your module

1481
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,200
there's a number of posts out there with

1482
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:05,520
uh

1483
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,839
examples of it uh we just had unicon

1484
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,599
where we had a number of folks talking

1485
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:10,000
about

1486
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,680
the porting of various different things

1487
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,920
like tim medine talked about creating a

1488
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,520
kerberosi module and

1489
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,319
uh tillery talked about vmware detection

1490
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:20,079
or vm detection and things like that so

1491
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:21,440
we have a lot of examples

1492
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,160
um develop your module any questions you

1493
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,000
have let us know we're here to help or

1494
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,280
also on discord and um once

1495
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,119
you have that you submit your model

1496
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,880
module we review it you can actually

1497
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,119
validate your module straight in the sdk

1498
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:37,359
module has buster has its own validation

1499
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:39,359
so really hands off but of course we'll

1500
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:40,880
help you through all this and

1501
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,480
um i think we're we're building

1502
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,720
something pretty cool here and we'd love

1503
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,520
for you to be

1504
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,160
a part of it

1505
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,240
so uh final piece um

1506
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,599
tradecraft and technique plus tooling

1507
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:58,240
is the post access space and so we have

1508
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,839
a choose your own adventure that we

1509
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:02,480
created it's a quick little arcade game

1510
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,280
um that we uh we worked with uh tim

1511
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,640
malcolmbetter

1512
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,839
um and here's the link

1513
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:12,400
it'll go right into it it's uh it's a

1514
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,559
lot of fun to play it's really easy

1515
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,319
um and it starts to get you into the

1516
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,000
mindset of what it's like to be a red

1517
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,119
team operator

1518
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:21,280
because now instead of just looking at

1519
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,280
hey i need to be technically clever

1520
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,559
now i'm starting to look at the

1521
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:26,319
tradecraft what do i need to do

1522
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:27,760
when i'm looking at detection and

1523
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,520
response on top of protection

1524
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,240
and it's just a lot of fun if you

1525
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,839
remember the choose your own adventure

1526
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:36,720
games

1527
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:40,640
uh or books uh yeah we miss those

1528
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,559
and that's it i think we're right on

1529
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:45,119
time do we do this again with like

1530
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:47,119

1531
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:48,880

1532
