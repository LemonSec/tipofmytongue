1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,040
all right I first talk is from buses can

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,020
fly thank you so much man for kicking us

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,000
off on the Saturday morning I really

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,840
appreciate it

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,270
this first talk is a hardware hacking

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:21,200
for the masses and you buy buses can fly

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,050
so take it away man hey thanks everyone

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,120
for coming really excited to give this

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,070
talk yeah my talk is hardware hacking

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,628
for the masses and you first boring

11
00:00:32,628 --> 00:00:34,640
disclaimer you know all the general

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,600
stuff not a lawyer

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,410
don't crime be responsible have fun

14
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,710
don't be dumb cite your sources so I am

15
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,870
buses can fly you can find me on twitter

16
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,210
at at buses can fly and really around

17
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,460
the internet with that handle I'm just a

18
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,829
new exploring when I find for fun it's

19
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:54,559
it's a hobby for me I love embedded and

20
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,100
automotive hacking car hacking all sorts

21
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,559
of hardware I'm a student I love rock

22
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,839
climbing quadcopter flying and just

23
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:03,649
generally messing around with

24
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:06,860
electronics so first off a little

25
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,540
overview of hardware hacking you know

26
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,000
what is it and that kind of raises the

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,450
question of what's regular hacking it's

28
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,189
making stuff what it's not supposed to

29
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:21,170
do finding out secrets it's there's no

30
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:26,299
exact definition it can be there's some

31
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:28,520
overlying topics between hardware

32
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,049
hacking and general hacking but overall

33
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:33,110
it's all just trying to do whatever you

34
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,509
want to do it's you can touch it

35
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:36,890
make you do stuff it's not supposed to

36
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:42,049
do and it's fun your hardware hacking so

37
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:43,430
some really common questions I get is

38
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:48,140
isn't hardware hacking hard which no yes

39
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,969
it depends depending on the level you're

40
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:54,380
looking at what you want to do there's

41
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,350
there's something for everyone but can

42
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:01,009
you hack hardware absolutely what do you

43
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:02,719
need to get started well that's what

44
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,299
this presentations for and then isn't

45
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:08,060
hardware hacking expensive it depends

46
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,820
there's some extremely expensive tools

47
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,560
out there there's a lot you can get for

48
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,210
really cheap or for basically free

49
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,340
actually the way I got started with

50
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,220
hardware hacking was out of a dumpster I

51
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:19,910
was

52
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,070
at a local conference and they had a

53
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,920
Destruction village for the kids and

54
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,480
there were a bunch of old routers in

55
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,700
there so I took two out that were the

56
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,320
same model column together into one

57
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,280
bought a $3 serial cable and that's that

58
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,770
was my first time hardware hacking

59
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,120
there's this big misconception I hear a

60
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,670
lot at conferences there's brilliant

61
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,800
people doing web stuff and crazy cool

62
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,320
you know exploit development but they go

63
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,990
like hardware no man that's who that's

64
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,640
the scary stuff that's hard stuff and I

65
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,890
disagree with that I think just like

66
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,170
anything else it can be you can

67
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,380
definitely get started in it for not not

68
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,150
too much money and not too much

69
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:03,500
difficulty so how do you learn the way I

70
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,120
started was doing a lot of electronics

71
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,250
projects I love little single board

72
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,710
computers or answer a pies banana pies

73
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,900
orange fries though the whole single

74
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,310
board Linux computers are great and they

75
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,740
have these GPIO pins similar to the

76
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,240
Arduinos which are also on this slide

77
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,910
and then general electronics projects I

78
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,500
think they're super helpful

79
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,400
actually it's see over here actually is

80
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,750
one of the first electronic projects

81
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,600
I've ever did which is kind of a very

82
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,910
simple one it's a 555 timer which is a

83
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,520
type of integrated circuit and with that

84
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,600
you can do a lot of stuff you can make a

85
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,280
little circuit to change how fast it

86
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,290
pulses something out but there's this

87
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,150
great project on magazine where you can

88
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,160
make your own rapid-fire Mouse using

89
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,890
this timer and entirely just hardware

90
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,510
you can make it you know rapid-fire for

91
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,950
whatever you want to do video games or

92
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,860
whatnot but you know be responsible but

93
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,360
there's a lot of really good resources

94
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,640
between projects there's a lot of good

95
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,080
books and at the end of the slide I

96
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,930
dumped a lot of resources links to

97
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,270
things things to watch things to read

98
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,910
the whole list up there web greece's as

99
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,250
always Google is your best friend

100
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,930
there's a few good great YouTube

101
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,340
channels right here and some more at the

102
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,260
end and then forums that I'll add more

103
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,790
also at the end of the slides but

104
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,410
there's a ton of really accessible and

105
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:18,380
easy to understand resources but I

106
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,810
highly recommend just going out googling

107
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,070
stuff finding a project that looks

108
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,480
really cool to you and just doing it

109
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,490
don't worry if about if it seems too

110
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,560
hard or if it seems like you don't

111
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,750
understand it just have at it and

112
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,830
eventually you'll get it and you'll

113
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,110
learn a ton on the way and just do a lot

114
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,580
of random

115
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,500
so some really quick things to know in

116
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,680
basics that are pretty important the

117
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,889
first idea is baud rate so that's the

118
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:45,060
formal definition you can see up there

119
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,360
but basically just you know you how fast

120
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,210
you can transfer information this is a

121
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,210
graph over here here's a graph of that

122
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,479
just you know ones and zeros a lot of

123
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:59,820
hardware you have a thing called a clock

124
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,410
speed which I'll talk more about some

125
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,710
hardware terms later but it's how fast

126
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,840
and how often these bits are transferred

127
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,660
on a network which as you can see it

128
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,150
gets pretty simple but there's a few

129
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,070
common baud rates we'll talk about it

130
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,660
later about how to interface with a lot

131
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,960
of hardware simply but a few thing you

132
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,060
need to know is that communication speed

133
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,410
because if you're hooking up to some

134
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,000
piece of hardware and you're trying to

135
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,470
talk at a different speed that it then

136
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,120
it's listening or you're listening at a

137
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,320
different speed is talking to you only

138
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,389
give you a gibberish out so there's a

139
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:32,669
few really common baud rates as you can

140
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:34,169
see right here but the really main ones

141
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:39,060
are 9600 and this 115 200 that's the

142
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,810
number of bits per second and the most

143
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:45,720
common there's a Python tool I linked

144
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,840
somewhere in this presentation also at

145
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,150
the end of the slides that's really

146
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,039
great you just run it and it tries all

147
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,300
the different baud rates and you can see

148
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,889
where the sensible information comes out

149
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,780
so you can figure that out but generally

150
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,039
whenever I'm doing something I just try

151
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,440
this and then this one so yeah that's

152
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,789
important to know just the speed of

153
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:07,620
communication what's going on then some

154
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,900
really common electronics terms I'm sure

155
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,190
most of you if not all of you are

156
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,930
familiar with really basic circuit stuff

157
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,759
which is basically there's a positive

158
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:17,039
and there's a negative and each circuit

159
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,509
has to complete in a circle

160
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:21,120
obviously PCBs printed circuit boards

161
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,699
and a lot of hardware it's a lot more

162
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:25,500
complicated than just a loop well all

163
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,729
the terms are still the same you have

164
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:29,099
VCC which basically is just you know

165
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:31,949
voltage there is voltage ground is the

166
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:34,169
negative connection you have R X which

167
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:36,240
means receive and T X which is

168
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,460
transmitted and this will come later so

169
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,800
you are as a communication protocol you

170
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,539
usually have your power and your ground

171
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:44,700
somewhere on the AC IC and then you have

172
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,380
a transmit connect to some the other

173
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,580
things

174
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,590
receive and one things transmitted

175
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,180
connected Taylor when receive so these

176
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,530
do can talk back and forth to each other

177
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,870
but we'll get more into you are not

178
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:59,129
there stuff later on yeah and then how

179
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:01,259
to find information about hardware this

180
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:04,229
is really underrated with everything

181
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:06,300
recon is a huge thing beforehand and you

182
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,680
can figure out basically everything you

183
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,270
need to know without actually touching

184
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,669
the hardware so there's a ton of

185
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:13,830
information online data sheets are a

186
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,710
goldmine data sheets and schematics can

187
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:21,240
contain that you would ever need it's a

188
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,069
ton of information but it's all super

189
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:25,169
useful so information about the ICS and

190
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:27,900
the board of processors normally I don't

191
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,909
know it's the best picture you see down

192
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:31,229
here there's usually words on these

193
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:34,199
chips and a lot of other stuff if you

194
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,449
just type that right into Google you

195
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:37,740
don't you don't even need to know what

196
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,449
it means just look it up like Texas

197
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:41,279
Instruments something or nxp or whatever

198
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,090
just Google at-at meg chips you'll find

199
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,610
like 20 page PDFs with data sheets and

200
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,050
they'll tell you whatever you need or if

201
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,639
you don't understand everything whatever

202
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,080
you can find there is gonna be super

203
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,169
useful then a hugely underrated resource

204
00:07:55,169 --> 00:07:59,310
is FCC documents online so any device I

205
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,889
believe sold in the US has to have that

206
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:04,020
that communicates over some sort of

207
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,569
radio frequency has to have an FCC ID I

208
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,250
put some example stickers here I just

209
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,990
found online like right here there's an

210
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:14,310
FCC ID here that's the MAC address

211
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,069
there's someone whatever it's somewhere

212
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:20,669
on this one but like right here and

213
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:22,800
right here examples of FCC IDs there's

214
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,810
usually it has to be a specific sticker

215
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,810
for this and that number there's a way

216
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,039
to do that so you see his official

217
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,889
website but this as you see that i/o

218
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:33,360
site is amazing

219
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,339
it'll forward everything you'll get the

220
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:37,229
documents there it's great and these

221
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:39,539
documents generally contain a lot of

222
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,010
information about what it's doing so

223
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,839
which frequencies it's communicating on

224
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,880
sometimes you get well usually you get

225
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,740
internal pictures of the hardware which

226
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,640
is amazing

227
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,019
we'll talk later in this presentation

228
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:51,089
about finding debug pins and what to

229
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:53,130
look for in the circuit boards but a lot

230
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,600
of the time before ever getting piece of

231
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,600
hardware I go to these FCC documents

232
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,250
look at internal pictures you can try

233
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,020
identify stuff just from the pictures

234
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,860
they provide

235
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,000
and different specifications about the

236
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,860
hardware and this can vary sometimes the

237
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:10,079
company can request to to suppress some

238
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:12,240
information and file that but usually it

239
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,740
still doesn't cover internal pictures

240
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,000
and you still know what frequency

241
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,680
everything's operating on and even if

242
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,300
you don't know the frequency there's a

243
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,560
lot of ways you could figure that out

244
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,120
and we'll talk more about that later too

245
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,800
and another way to get information

246
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,380
obviously is the firmware sometimes

247
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,959
that's just online you can just go to

248
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,640
the manufacturers website performing the

249
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,380
hardware download the firmware and

250
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,519
reverse-engineer it from there

251
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,250
if not you can dump it off the hardware

252
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,170
itself but we'll talk about that also a

253
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,839
little later so then getting into the

254
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,800
hardware what do you look for you know

255
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,720
so now you've got you know this router

256
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,970
you've cracked it open you know what's

257
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,860
inside so the main thing we look for is

258
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,260
what we call debug informations so like

259
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,730
when you write program you need debug

260
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,260
information you just extra information

261
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,839
to help facilitate whatever you're

262
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:58,170
making

263
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,540
so the code has to be loaded on devices

264
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,750
somehow right and the devs need a way to

265
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,579
see extra information or interact with

266
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:09,209
their devices so there's a lot there's

267
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,430
these different standards for little

268
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,260
things on the circuit board for how you

269
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,750
can hook it up and how you can hook up

270
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,240
to those debug in from ports and get

271
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,670
extra information out of them and

272
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,470
sometimes if you're lucky you just plug

273
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,269
in a cable basically to these pins and

274
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:26,220
it drops you straight to a root shell

275
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,399
it's unfortunately common there's not a

276
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,560
ton to it sometimes it'll end into a

277
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,480
busy box shell some sort of limited

278
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,120
shell something custom and then one time

279
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,440
I was looking at this one piece of

280
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,190
industrial equipment and no joke it

281
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:43,740
dropped me for into ARM arm

282
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,140
arch linux forearm which I didn't know

283
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,140
is a thing beforehand and probably

284
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,190
shouldn't be the thing that this

285
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,110
industrial equipments running but you

286
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,360
know anything's possible route chills

287
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,540
are common sometimes you just get

288
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,620
information as it's booting which can be

289
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,089
super useful you can pull off from that

290
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:02,459
and there's ways to kind of get it to

291
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:04,709
then give you a shell or mess with that

292
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:06,089
to put it get into that and I won't talk

293
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:07,470
about that a ton here but it's

294
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,510
definitely something to look into

295
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,370
but how do we get this information

296
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,079
there's a couple as I mentioned earlier

297
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:15,570
protocols and standards for how to

298
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,220
okay with hardware these things like you

299
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,080
are in JTAG which I have slides that

300
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:23,130
later which are just pins or things like

301
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,750
test pads on a board that you can talk

302
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,150
to there's these communication protocols

303
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,610
like SPI I to see your I square see

304
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:32,160
however you want to say it just worth it

305
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,070
Google you'll see that a lot in our do

306
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,180
we know projects you do that this is the

307
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,540
SPI interface model then you have some

308
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,340
more common interfaces like if you're

309
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,080
looking at a router USB an ethernet

310
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,610
really common but very underrated

311
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,960
there's a lot you can talk to it up

312
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,370
sometime because there's a bit going

313
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,740
there that's always useful and then oh

314
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,940
yeah you're gonna use the link toast

315
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,200
document with a Python tool to identify

316
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,080
baud rate there's four tools I put right

317
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,500
there

318
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,870
I don't know screen mini-com mini term

319
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,910
puddi whatever you want they all can do

320
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,320
serial connections there's a bajillion

321
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,290
more I don't know if it works for you it

322
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:08,310
works yeah use whatever you need and

323
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,960
then I have some pictures here but we'll

324
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,150
talk about this later these are the

325
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,380
tools you can use to interface with a

326
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,410
lot of hardware and yeah I'll get deeper

327
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,920
into it so you are this is a huge one

328
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,330
this is basically if you understand this

329
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:26,910
like 60% of those low-lying this is the

330
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,830
low-lying fruit and a lot of hardware

331
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,350
talking and a lot of hardware hacking so

332
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,670
you are it stands for a universal

333
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,310
asynchronous receiver transmitter that's

334
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,860
a mouthful but Universal makes sense

335
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,930
asynchronous also kind of makes sense

336
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,670
and then receive transmit that makes

337
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,140
sense we were looking at a model of this

338
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,870
earlier so you are is generally four

339
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,000
different pins here's a picture of a

340
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,530
UART breakout there's also one here

341
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,420
where the company helpfully pre soldered

342
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,820
the pins on but it's generally four pins

343
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,000
and the thing is you really only need to

344
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,390
hook up to 3 because VCC is the fourth

345
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,550
one so there would be a VCC up here and

346
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:05,040
we talked about that earlier voltage the

347
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,200
thing is normally let's say the router

348
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,970
example again you're powering the router

349
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,220
and you want to hook up to UART the

350
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,470
router already has power so then when

351
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,480
you hook up the VCC pin on your uark

352
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,960
cable stuff isn't super happy and even

353
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,430
though this is like a super basic thing

354
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,620
to know this is how I blew up one of the

355
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:26,280
USB ports in my laptop it's a huge new

356
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,810
mistake

357
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:30,020
so many pieces of hardware like that

358
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:33,330
generally just hook up our XTX in ground

359
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,700
and this cable I have a slide later

360
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,160
showing that but red is generally VCC

361
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,050
black is ground and you have our X TX

362
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,200
which are green and white just don't

363
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,790
don't hook up the red one right is for

364
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,380
danger and snip it off or something

365
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,570
probably won't need it oh yeah how do

366
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,370
you identify you our breakouts on

367
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,760
hardware but general you can just do

368
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,930
trial and error but there's kind of

369
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,280
small tricks and standards that you

370
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,430
develop over time ground the ground pin

371
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,590
is usually square like you can see right

372
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,840
here it's a special square but also

373
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,370
ground is shared across the hardware so

374
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,020
basically every component needs a link

375
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,130
to ground because that's how circuits

376
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,900
work in that loop so you can find

377
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,910
anything that is ground which you know

378
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,070
there's a like RF shields on hardware

379
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,180
which is like this looks like a little

380
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,940
metal box covering whatever is

381
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,150
broadcasting RF that's usually grounded

382
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,700
I mean every piece one side is gonna be

383
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,040
grounded yeah but it's shared across the

384
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,810
board if you don't have a specific pin

385
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:31,980
or you want to like hack your way into

386
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,310
UART the VC C the voltage trace is

387
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:38,190
usually a little thicker that's just its

388
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,450
standard just because that's to carry

389
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,760
the power but again you don't really

390
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,560
need to hook up to it so if you can

391
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,850
figure out ground which is pretty easy

392
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,190
because it's either a square labeled or

393
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,740
you know something like that

394
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:54,000
Rx and TX are can I just you know 5050

395
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,980
like if this was voltage we're not gonna

396
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,020
hook that up this is ground and then

397
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,200
these two are Rx and TX I choose one

398
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,570
just like put one in each

399
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,730
and if gibberish comes out flip them

400
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,550
just do the other combination because if

401
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,530
you flip these it'll just look weird and

402
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:11,520
then you just flip them and then it

403
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,400
works but tools for identifying this you

404
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,570
can use the civil scopes and logic

405
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:19,980
analyzers they're super nice an

406
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,930
oscilloscope is a tool that displays

407
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,300
kind of voltages over time so you can

408
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,890
visualize what's happening in a certain

409
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,930
place and logic analyzers do similar

410
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,970
things but basically it's just a magic

411
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,410
device you can hook it up to these pins

412
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,810
and see what kind of voltage is going on

413
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,880
so if you see a solid line at the top

414
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,830
and it says like five volts it's

415
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:41,460
probably BCC and then Rx and TX might do

416
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,540
you might have these little like crazy

417
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,160
waves or something depending on what the

418
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,740
broadcast yeah that's you are this is

419
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,080
the thing to go for and a lot of things

420
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,540
if you see four pins in the line on a

421
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,290
piece of hardware

422
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,270
either that or in these kind of headers

423
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:57,870
or holes probably you are probably can

424
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,370
drop you straight to a shell or it will

425
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:02,340
get you at least more information great

426
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,990
to go for and then okay that was weird

427
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,640
slightly out of time but whatever so

428
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,320
here's some you are at examples I took

429
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,340
this picture a day ago I was just

430
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,320
prepping something for slides but this

431
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,520
router and I have some pictures later

432
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,200
well we can look at identifying these

433
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,140
things but you can see here ground Rx

434
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,780
and TX all right and it just hook up to

435
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,400
a router hooked up to a serial adapter

436
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,530
and then going to my computer so this

437
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:26,760
can drop you to different stuff these

438
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,530
are online but I found like tp-link has

439
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,960
their weird specific shell for some of

440
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,030
their routers and you can try escaping

441
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,400
out of this limited shell and to busybox

442
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,930
chela for permissions and then doing

443
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,030
whatever use the screenshot of that baud

444
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:42,180
rate tool where it hooked up using this

445
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,710
padre and you get a bunch of information

446
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,980
and stuff boots this is a you arc cable

447
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,020
missus like adafruit's fancy one but I

448
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,790
was just looking I wanted a picture with

449
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,650
the different pins and these are the

450
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,690
colorings for the pins oh that is not

451
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,720
green okay well this is green and this

452
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,330
is blue don't worry about it but our XTX

453
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,270
ground and VCC don't hook up the red one

454
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,160
if the device is powered or else stuff

455
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,930
goes boom and the question is you know

456
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,550
what now if it lands you to a root shell

457
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,200
you know it's kind of to you this is

458
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,760
where maybe hopefully a previous

459
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,349
experience kicks in you know what you're

460
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:15,180
looking for like a Linux environment you

461
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,770
can look for private keys or different

462
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,750
stuff you know changing firewall rules

463
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,819
on routers is always fun and then kind

464
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:23,430
of a you know a community standard and

465
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,650
my personal favorite thing to do is just

466
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,790
load doom on things I've played doom on

467
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,920
tons of automobiles on a 50 kilowatt

468
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,670
hour car charger and so many things just

469
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,440
aren't supposed to run do them and are

470
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,350
so much fun when you play duel on them

471
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,190
but these are some things you can expect

472
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,580
when you hook up over serial another

473
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,540
interface is JTAG which was made and put

474
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,970
into effect by the joint test action

475
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,210
group it's this is a weird one for sure

476
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:54,930
so the

477
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,190
pin count can vary and you can see

478
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,900
there's some different standards for

479
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,940
that but they have basically the same

480
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:05,460
core pins yeah Pinkham can vary court

481
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,470
battle amount stays the same it can be

482
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,510
and then clonal quote secured with a key

483
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,510
or password which is common do you uh

484
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:14,730
have the manufacturer put some kind of

485
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,280
key in but if the key is common across

486
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,470
all of their devices the same key and

487
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,330
one person dumps it and then shares it

488
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,680
to everyone else then you can you know

489
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,930
bypass that je tags kind of hit or miss

490
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:28,680
when you're playing with hardware if the

491
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,060
manufacturer labels it they're being

492
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,890
amazing or if they tell you know which

493
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,180
one a corner and they follow this

494
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,680
standard well there's tools like the

495
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,540
jtagulator and makes it alot easier to

496
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,150
identify what pins are doing one how you

497
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,130
can hook up to that and after that the

498
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,720
information you get is pretty similar to

499
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,150
what you get out of you art oh yeah so I

500
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,890
took some pictures a little bit ago of

501
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,720
some routers I just crack them open took

502
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,310
a picture of the inside I thought it'd

503
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,200
be fun to just kind of look over it so

504
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:55,740
right now

505
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,160
you if you're watching this take a look

506
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,240
you know what do you see that's

507
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,640
interesting so I don't know right off

508
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,350
the bat there's a lot here so this is an

509
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,090
example of the RF shield I was talking

510
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,980
about this little metal box which

511
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,900
helpfully is grounded which is nice and

512
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,100
usually these huge pads would be

513
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,680
grounded too but this is inside here is

514
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,660
something that broadcasts RF this

515
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,920
heatsink means there's probably

516
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,660
something that put the heat out under

517
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,210
that so some sort of CPU Broadcom chip

518
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,160
for RF this is a bunch of Ethernet ports

519
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,630
and MAC addresses like USB ports this is

520
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:33,330
power in reset button and antenna body

521
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,480
capacitors some chips I would definitely

522
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,080
look up these IDs the FCC ID is on the

523
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,730
bottom of this but the really neat thing

524
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,960
you can see right off the bat is over

525
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,240
here looks like we have a Jacob breakout

526
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,060
JTAG breakout something else I'm sure of

527
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:52,380
yet but if you look right there they

528
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,790
were helpful enough to solder on the

529
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,320
headers for us at the manufacturer and

530
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,290
look they even labeled them VCC rx T X

531
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,450
and ground that's great so when you hook

532
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,490
up the cable to this dumps you actually

533
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:03,960
this one to a busybox shell

534
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,170
it's pretty nice and then another

535
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,480
example this one

536
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,400
did not blow up super well so I'm sorry

537
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,820
it's really blurry but you can see right

538
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,850
there JTAG and you can really not see

539
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,230
right here but there's another four pin

540
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,179
you are and what's interesting is you

541
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:22,490
know unsoldered connectors here that

542
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,700
could be pretty fun to see what's there

543
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,710
another example yep this one blew up

544
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,970
kind of better but it's still pretty

545
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,690
grainy so sorry but you look here still

546
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,610
a lot going on not sure what these are

547
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,830
worth taking a look if you look online

548
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:40,610
more chip names saddest LEDs you know

549
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:43,610
voltage regulator and then right there

550
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:46,610
looks we have JTAG and UART with pre

551
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,980
soldered headers love it when they do

552
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:54,410
that another example same stuff JTAG

553
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:57,080
something else more thing you look at

554
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,169
but yeah over time when you start to

555
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:01,490
look at these things you just start to

556
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,220
see them a lot quicker and it's just

557
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:09,380
worth picking that up and it gets weird

558
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,970
there's lots of different standards and

559
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,309
techniques that the manufacturers of the

560
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:15,440
hardware use there's different formats

561
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,960
like this kind of JTAG breakout this one

562
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,210
is helpfully labeled but it changes

563
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,190
there's these things this is kind of a

564
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,350
crazy example I found online but these

565
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,940
little like gold circles that are a

566
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,470
little wider

567
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,580
those are test points for testing

568
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,260
hardware they're not always super

569
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,090
interesting you can use something like a

570
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,669
logic analyzer to map them out you might

571
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:36,260
be able to like make you on you are

572
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,090
interface out of like that one that one

573
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:41,540
that one I don't know so I'm an extreme

574
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,220
level and my people fund mapping those

575
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,350
out but you learn a lot of this through

576
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,320
experience you know the more things you

577
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,500
watch the more resources you look at

578
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,360
there's just a lot to know and it's hard

579
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,100
to figure that out to find that out all

580
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,250
at once so this is an example of a PCB

581
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,830
with vias which are these little dots

582
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:01,910
here the ones with the hole in the

583
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,169
middle they just connect different

584
00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:05,000
layers of the PCB because circuit boards

585
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,610
if you didn't know very commonly have

586
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,500
multiple layers just you know to fit

587
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,419
more stuff on them and communicate and

588
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:12,919
some of the layers communicate this way

589
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:15,020
this makes it sometimes hard because you

590
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,390
can see these traces on the PCB actually

591
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:20,630
let's go to a previous picture you can

592
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,419
kind of see here these little lines and

593
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:24,489
circuit board connecting parts that's

594
00:22:24,489 --> 00:22:26,649
exactly what they're doing so you can

595
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:28,239
actually trace these lines a lot and we

596
00:22:28,239 --> 00:22:30,789
were looking at the you are interfaces

597
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:32,889
let's see if I have a better picture

598
00:22:32,889 --> 00:22:34,450
yeah here you can look at the UART

599
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,580
interface these lines coming off of the

600
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,100
pins or what the pins are connected to

601
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,919
their like instead of a wire on a

602
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,509
breadboard or something these are on the

603
00:22:43,509 --> 00:22:45,129
circuit board and manufactured in with

604
00:22:45,129 --> 00:22:47,139
the a in the silicon so you can usually

605
00:22:47,139 --> 00:22:49,450
trace these out when I say the VCC trace

606
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,039
is a little thicker that's like this

607
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,840
line it's generally it's a little

608
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,730
thicker so let's go back and be is can

609
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,159
connect those layers and traces so

610
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,869
sometimes the vias make it hard to

611
00:23:01,869 --> 00:23:03,700
follow but you can usually just kind of

612
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,109
with your finger look at that and if the

613
00:23:05,109 --> 00:23:06,639
via ends up on the other end you can

614
00:23:06,639 --> 00:23:08,799
follow that trace there but just you

615
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,489
know skills to gain over time and then

616
00:23:12,489 --> 00:23:14,529
there's a lot of different hardware

617
00:23:14,529 --> 00:23:16,509
hacking like anything else you know web

618
00:23:16,509 --> 00:23:18,940
or just hacking in general it's not one

619
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,590
thing there's so many different kind of

620
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:23,499
sub subcategories I'm a huge fan of

621
00:23:23,499 --> 00:23:25,149
automotive and car hacking I think it's

622
00:23:25,149 --> 00:23:27,460
a ton of fun and these two pictures over

623
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,769
here are kind of like very core to car

624
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:32,409
hacking this is the obd2 connector which

625
00:23:32,409 --> 00:23:33,940
is the thing under the dash your car

626
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,980
that gets plugged into when you go to

627
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,749
emissions testing there's a couple

628
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,659
really important pins but you know 614

629
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:42,899
and 311 are the ones you look at a lot

630
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:45,279
and this is an example of a cam frame

631
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,549
which is how that how the can network

632
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:50,080
works in a car but to find out more

633
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,980
about that I link to another

634
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,809
presentation at the end by a good friend

635
00:23:52,809 --> 00:23:54,789
of mine inspectors he did a LevelUp talk

636
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:57,820
and level up 0x0 for about getting

637
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,169
started with car hack so check that out

638
00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:01,389
if you're interesting IOT devices are

639
00:24:01,389 --> 00:24:03,450
you know huge for hardware hacking

640
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:06,970
whether it's I don't know doorbells and

641
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:11,289
locks to smart TVs and routers there's

642
00:24:11,289 --> 00:24:12,820
just so much going on and honestly a lot

643
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,129
of them are terrible as we've learned

644
00:24:15,129 --> 00:24:16,779
from things like Murai and all that

645
00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:18,220
security isn't really something people

646
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,889
pay for so there's a lot of devices just

647
00:24:20,889 --> 00:24:23,289
hook up a serial cable and it just drops

648
00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:25,779
you to root shell and then from there

649
00:24:25,779 --> 00:24:27,639
you can do you know more recon find bugs

650
00:24:27,639 --> 00:24:29,619
once you have a root shell or the

651
00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:32,139
firmware you can do a lot of stuff to

652
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:33,489
try and get more info like if you dump

653
00:24:33,489 --> 00:24:34,779
the firmware off a device you can use a

654
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:36,190
tool called bin walk

655
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,019
car files out of n you can sometimes get

656
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:40,090
the whole file system whatever you can

657
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:42,220
look for that look for vulnerable things

658
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,779
and get a lot of information that way

659
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:46,210
there's a lot of ICS SCADA stuff and

660
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,529
hardware and this is the scary field

661
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:49,720
this is a industrial control systems and

662
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,679
I freak at this kid AK acronym honestly

663
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,389
but whatever industrial control stuff

664
00:24:55,389 --> 00:24:58,179
this is like the super important nuclear

665
00:24:58,179 --> 00:24:58,840
power plant

666
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,019
powering electronics and they're not

667
00:25:02,019 --> 00:25:03,669
always the most stable like if they have

668
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,769
some sort of a network connection a lot

669
00:25:05,769 --> 00:25:07,450
of them crash when you end map them and

670
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,100
stuff like that which is kind of scary

671
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,679
but it's a cool place to be

672
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,100
Planes Trains pet Predator drones

673
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,090
they're all hackable and they're all

674
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,610
hardware so I know planes and trains

675
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,620
communicate over can in the same way a

676
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,049
lot of cars do and a lot of things do

677
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:24,129
Predator drones I'm not sure but I'd

678
00:25:24,129 --> 00:25:25,720
love to find out if anyone has a

679
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,549
predator drone and would let me mess

680
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:31,389
with it hit me up who car chargers

681
00:25:31,389 --> 00:25:33,820
that's a ton of fun car chargers

682
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,529
actually implement sometimes the same

683
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:38,019
can communication technology and usually

684
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:40,570
that they're just running you know busy

685
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:41,679
box or something in the background

686
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,450
there's one I was playing with that just

687
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,840
ran excellent oh that was fun voting

688
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,090
machines check out the voting machine

689
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,320
village at DEFCON but you know don't

690
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,970
destabilize governments or anything but

691
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,559
this is a picture I believe from the DEF

692
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,600
CON voting machine voting the voting

693
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,580
machine village a lot of voting machines

694
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,110
are actually like pretty terrible but

695
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,879
we're not gonna get into that follow

696
00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:06,460
stuff online for that I don't like at

697
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,379
hacker fantastic I think it did some

698
00:26:08,379 --> 00:26:09,940
stuff with that and then you know

699
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,750
regular phones years and years ago phone

700
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,129
phreaking was the big hardware hacking

701
00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:19,330
it still is it's pretty awesome but just

702
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,860
regular phones now have a lot going on

703
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,480
to think just recently with the

704
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,309
checkmate exploit for the iPhone boot

705
00:26:27,309 --> 00:26:30,330
ROM stuff someone also published a JTAG

706
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,860
debugger a physical hardware thing for

707
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,340
iPhone so that's one too um and then

708
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,009
tools this is my favorite part

709
00:26:38,009 --> 00:26:40,450
hardware hacking is a ton of fun I don't

710
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:44,559
know I love tools and my little kits and

711
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,000
a lot of these can get kind of expensive

712
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,830
but a lot of them are pretty cheap like

713
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,170
we were talking about serial break outs

714
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:52,780
getting a you are cable for like three

715
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:56,680
dollars that can break fine it's worth

716
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,190
it

717
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,990
I've had the same you are cable for like

718
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:01,750
a year and a half now and it's gotten me

719
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,580
so many different shells it's wonderful

720
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,890
just three bucks pull a thing out of a

721
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,500
dumpster and you're on your way there's

722
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,480
a lot of other you know more expensive

723
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,640
tools sometimes very very specific use

724
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,100
cases and sometimes not the black magic

725
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,590
probe is a great JTAG adapter jtagulator

726
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,780
and the SheiKra are pretty nice multi

727
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,670
tools for communication this is a

728
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:23,770
cannibal which is hooking for one of the

729
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:24,880
things you can use to hook up to these

730
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,680
Oh buddy two ports but there's a lot of

731
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,180
different tools like that chick

732
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,410
whisperer you can do advanced like

733
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,570
glitching and power side channel attacks

734
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:35,410
it's pretty sweet the great FET it's a

735
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:37,510
general purpose tool it's amazing logic

736
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:39,130
analyzers super useful we talked about

737
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:42,060
it earlier jtagulator is a huge

738
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,730
wonderful tool for JTAG stuff and then

739
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,230
you know some random stuff I shout out

740
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:50,350
to the exploit tears and yeah I have at

741
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,580
the end of this presentation a bunch of

742
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,890
little information dumps lots of links

743
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:56,140
for you to follow talks to watch things

744
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,620
that have helped me a lot in the past

745
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,810
wow these are great use of resources

746
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:03,280
there's just so much with hardware

747
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,750
hacking I can't really outline it all

748
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:07,990
even in like a 30 minute talk or a 40

749
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:10,060
minute talk there's it's like it's a

750
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,410
really wide world

751
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,390
I really recommend just googling stuff

752
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,490
and just going at it just information

753
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:17,770
overload watch all the DEF CON hardware

754
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:20,500
talking a hacking talks just you know go

755
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,620
crazy do a bunch of projects I put more

756
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,300
links into here but you just add

757
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,740
anything else you pick this up over time

758
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,110
with little chunks see you and then yeah

759
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:32,260
here's some shoutouts my mayor amazing

and they give you amazing training and

772
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,400
you get hands-on hacking time with a

773
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,620
bunch of cars yeah shout out to the car

774

hacking village

775
00:29:03,929 --> 00:29:06,419
crowd was give me a lot of opportunities

776
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:08,220
with hardware hacking and some of my

777
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,600
friends here oh yeah

778
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,399

free to hit me up on Twitter my buses

784
00:29:23,879 --> 00:29:26,100
can fly seriously that we can talk about

785
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,110
anything I'm happy to chat about

786
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:31,259
hardware hacking if I can help thank you

787
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:34,649
so much man are you gonna let's promote

788
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:36,860
your Twitter account because I imagine

789
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,779
people will want all these resources and

790
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,279
will try to share them as well obviously

791
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,230
we'll have an archived version of this

792
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,899
talk up online so people can check out

793
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:48,029
things but how can people follow you on

794
00:29:48,029 --> 00:29:53,149
twitter yeah I am at buses can fly as

795
00:29:53,149 --> 00:29:56,009
