1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,780
all right thank you so much everyone

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,760
Rohan take it away I'm really excited

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,070
for this talk all right hell

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,189
everybody had Sam mentioned the title of

5
00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:18,470
this talk in g-suit security everyone

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,770
wants it but not everyone gets it and

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,900
just FYI I will be monitoring the chat

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,060
so after the talk if I have some time

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,500
I'm happy to answer any questions you

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,019
guys have but let's get started right on

11
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:32,840
this and we'll see what we can cover

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,019
today so a quick background of Who I am

13
00:00:36,019 --> 00:00:38,210
I'm a full time student at Cal State

14
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,640
University Fullerton and I do bug

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,620
bounties for fun so bug bounties are

16
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,660
something that I do for research for

17
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,039
finding unique ways to get into

18
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:47,809
companies so even though there are web

19
00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:49,670
security stuff that I usually find I

20
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,579
also tend to focus on getting into

21
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:53,989
internal access through different means

22
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:56,329
so you might have seen some of my weird

23
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:58,219
things that are fine and disclosed so

24
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:00,320
those are the things I focus on these

25
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,969
sweet is one of them since there's a lot

26
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:03,699
of things you can do on G suite and

27
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:06,050
there's a lot of ways to mess up on that

28
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,300
as well you can find me on Twitter as

29
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,160
uranium hacker I usually post a lot

30
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,670
about security things blogs that I find

31
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:14,690
interesting and everything else like

32
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,330
that I have my own blog sites the Google

33
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,360
allcom sestok you find COMSEC blocks so

34
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,430
you guys go to that have multiple links

35
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,470
to different things I find some of them

36
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,210
are specific vulnerabilities so it could

37
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,759
be like ID or and some company or some

38
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:30,200
of them are more generic that are

39
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,119
widespread and some of the things that

40
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:33,860
I'm covering today are already like some

41
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,630
of them are already on the block so you

42
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,250
guys can refer to the blog and use that

43
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:41,689
or your own use as well so let's kind of

44
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:43,340
get started into what it G sweet for

45
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,930
people that don't know what G sweet it's

46
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,770
it's basically Google's version of Gmail

47
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,180
Google Drive Google calendars pretty

48
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,710
much everything combined in a

49
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,079
software-as-a-service designed for

50
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,960
companies so for example when we use

51
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,600
gmail.com we have access to Gmail Google

52
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,460
Drive school calendars for that email

53
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,340
and Google decided let's bring that to

54
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,960
companies so now we have if you have a

55
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,579
buck route if you're a buck or employee

56
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:10,220
be up at baccara calm if buck are using

57
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,989
G suite you can use that to send emails

58
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:13,579
directly so you don't need to worry

59
00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:15,380
about setting up email service through

60
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,480
other companies Google will handle that

61
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,970
for you so there's like you want email

62
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,250
you just ask that you want calendar this

63
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,930
will give you that you want shared drive

64
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,569
speed on companies you get

65
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:27,969
of those as well so it basically has

66
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:29,560
combinations of everything and then the

67
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,450
best part is you can use that to log in

68
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,370
to other places so if you have Google

69
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,989
cloud platform that's another thing you

70
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:37,239
can log into just basically a combined

71
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:39,310
product for all the Google features out

72
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,650
there and that's the best part of it

73
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,799
since everyone wants to use it but it

74
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:46,840
also leads to super easy verne abilities

75
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,870
because what happens is admins will sign

76
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,359
up reduce weight and start importing

77
00:02:52,359 --> 00:02:54,519
employees but they will not realize that

78
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:56,379
there's gonna be security issues with

79
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:58,689
that there could be employees sharing

80
00:02:58,689 --> 00:02:59,980
things that this will not be sharing

81
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,650
outside to everyone so the admins won't

82
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,909
realize there are settings that gee

83
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:05,530
suite has where you can click on a

84
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,680
button and prevent the whole leak that's

85
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,629
why it's really fun to look at G suite

86
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:12,250
because if you get something it can

87
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,829
usually be a critical issue for a

88
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:17,109
company if they disclose a lot of info

89
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:19,299
or you could use that info out there

90
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,400
that they have disclosed to chain it to

91
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,680
further attacks and I will go over those

92
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,199
when I'm in some them so let's first

93
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,609
start with the first one and that's

94
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:31,150
Google calendars and I have a small note

95
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,579
for everybody on that is I probably

96
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:35,139
similar be able to see your meetings you

97
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:37,540
know just saying that because everyone

98
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,659
tends to leave their meetings open so

99
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:43,120
for example the Khoisan behind this that

100
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,859
resulted on us looking at google

101
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:47,829
calendars is we were testing out a

102
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:50,439
couple of bucks in a platform and we

103
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,419
noticed there was Google counter being

104
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:54,909
used we were curious like what happens

105
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:56,889
if I put an employees email on my Google

106
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:58,449
Calendar since Google allows sharing

107
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:01,750
calendars and importing calendars so we

108
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,370
decided you know let's give it a shot

109
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,739
and I really like a company to hack

110
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:08,409
which was uber so we decided to try some

111
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:10,439
uber emails and see if it would work and

112
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:13,269
it did so that's where we knew that it

113
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:15,790
was gonna work perfectly and to go from

114
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,108
there so a couple of things that

115
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:19,719
motivated is calendars are pretty

116
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:21,099
sensitive you know when you create a

117
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:24,070
calendar when you create events you kind

118
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,050
of tend to add a lot of sensitive data

119
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,820
there for example if you're flying

120
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,440
somewhere your information or if your

121
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,900
flight will be there for companies it's

122
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,900
also more of meetings so we wanted to

123
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,490
see what kind of information we can get

124
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,340
and can we automate this process

125
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,070
so for example let's say we can find one

126
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,960
calendar for each company for each

127
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,360
employee instead of manually putting

128
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,040
this email every time we wanted to see

129
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,210
if we could automate so it was a

130
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,190
programming challenge as well for us to

131
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,770
figure this one out and also as I said

132
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,860
we wanted to see more info because

133
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,630
personally for me web security is a

134
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,419
really good topic but I also tend to so

135
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:03,610
do companies that your websites might be

136
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,229
secure but your employees are kind of

137
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:07,150
giving out details that this will not be

138
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,370
giving out and calendar was a perfect

139
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,290
way to show that so we started creating

140
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,690
test cases we started looking into

141
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,280
different things and I'll be going over

142
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,020
like a little bit technical aspect of

143
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,830
that in the next slide so when we're

144
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,540
looking into this we decided to first

145
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,630
check on Google calendar the calendar

146
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,460
the Google section where you can add

147
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,840
other people's calendar but it was

148
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,760
manual so you go there you put an email

149
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,590
and you're putting companies in email

150
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,360
there but there's you know it's manual

151
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,650
you have to try for every email

152
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,289
copy/paste and see how it works it's

153
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:40,419
kind of sucked so we found out that

154
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:41,919
Google also allows you to embed

155
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,510
calendars which is even better because

156
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,210
now I can just add emails and then see

157
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,330
the response because there are different

158
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,820
status codes for different things so 200

159
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,200
means the calendar is public or

160
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,750
something could be accessed for that and

161
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,410
if it gives 404 then the calendar is not

162
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,930
public or it does not exist knowing that

163
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,729
we could easily create a script because

164
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:05,110
now we don't have to worry about

165
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,810
anything we already know it's 200 right

166
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,580
so if it's hits like if you are giving

167
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,690
it 100 MLS

168
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,330
50 of them are 200 likely chances it's

169
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,389
public so it's it was pretty interesting

170
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:18,610
for us to look at that aspect and that's

171
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,500
like an example of this is when you look

172
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,460
at the embed

173
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,979
I have a picture here for my calendar

174
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:27,099
and when I go on it you can see it gives

175
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:28,990
out some informations since I'm a

176
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,180
student there's nothing much but try to

177
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,919
see it from a company point of view

178
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:35,050
right if I have a buck rowdy fab goober

179
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,360
some employee has this public calendar

180
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,889
out there there could be a lot of

181
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:41,349
sensitive data for example zoom meetings

182
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:42,849
which can be accessible by everyone

183
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:45,280
since by default zoom doesn't have a

184
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,479
password requirement so as a sysadmin on

185
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:51,580
Zoom you can set that but not every

186
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,160
company does it so it was just

187
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,470
easy to just jump into meetings and have

188
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:58,230
some kind of sensitive access with that

189
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,170
so for example we'll see Jim links join

190
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,270
any meetings you want you have internal

191
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,550
Google Docs I'll also explain why that

192
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,800
matters when we go over the Google Docs

193
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,990
section and why private Google Docs soon

194
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,470
remain private and also saved password

195
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,060
for internal sites so I guess we'll have

196
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,280
a story to tell about that and before

197
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,720
that let's look at this so here's an

198
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,610
example of a real meeting we joined when

199
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,620
we were testing and it was pretty

200
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,020
interesting you go to the employees

201
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,970
calendar you click on it and there you

202
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,950
go it had a zoom link and we knew

203
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,480
exactly what time it was so we dropped

204
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,190
into it right then and it was the

205
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,320
meeting was like barely starting so as

206
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,640
soon as we knew that will happen we

207
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,680
decided to leave right away since we

208
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,790
didn't want to stay on the meeting and

209
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,860
the best part of this is when you click

210
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,370
on it

211
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,340
since zoom allows you to rename your

212
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,740
names so for example in this talk I

213
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,540
already know had my club name I changed

214
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,430
it back to my personal name you could do

215
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,690
the same thing when you join this

216
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,820
meeting because at first it's based on

217
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,890
your login but since you already know

218
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:57,480
the employees name

219
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,040
you just plug that in and you have

220
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,140
access to it and you can like kind of

221
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,640
fist people just think you are a real

222
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,240
employee so now we decided to automate

223
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,590
it that's where a little bit of

224
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,840
technical part comes as of this morning

225
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,550
we have disclosed this exploit /script

226
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,260
that makes it easier to do all these

227
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,470
checks it uses hunters our IO which is a

228
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,630
email fetching website so hunter IO has

229
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,940
a public list of all emails out there it

230
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,440
makes it easier for you to see all the

231
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,210
employee emails and then go from there

232
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:30,660
and do any other test you have to so

233
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,490
what we did was we decided to use hunter

234
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,440
to fetch all the emails create a Python

235
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,789
script that would check all the emails

236
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,950
for the calendar link and see if it's

237
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,260
200 if it is it will save it to a txt

238
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,020
file and if you want you could even go

239
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,090
to the length which we did but it's not

240
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,280
on the script is you go take pictures of

241
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,990
all of these calendars so you know which

242
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,150
one's valid which one is not and it

243
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,880
reduces a lot of work in your side after

244
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,720
you have the script down but there is a

245
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,960
little bit of a con and pros pros and

246
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,490
con kind of thing for the script is

247
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,160
after we disclose the blog so we wrote

248
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,019
about the Google Calendar

249
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:09,149
quite a while ago and after we disclosed

250
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,250
it I think a lot of bug bounty hunters

251
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,550
decided to try it out so obviously it

252
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,930
was easy to script so a lot of people

253
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,029
decided to create scripts out and Google

254
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:20,970
probably noticed that so they have rate

255
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,279
limited calendar the Google don't come

256
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,689
now so you probably want to be careful

257
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:28,529
of how much requests you've sent because

258
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:30,750
you probably don't want to send like 500

259
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,009
requests a second or something since

260
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:33,949
you'll kind of get rate limited on that

261
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:36,870
there are probably bypasses to it the

262
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,300
script doesn't cover that yet I am

263
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,220
looking at some of the bypasses this

264
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,750
week so there have been couple we have

265
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,779
found to bypass the rate limit but we'll

266
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:48,029
see if we can embed that on the script

267
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:49,529
or not we'll have to discuss with Google

268
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:51,689
in regards to that so if you are

269
00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:52,980
interested in doing this attack if

270
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,449
you're interested in Google Calendar a

271
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:57,209
quick TL DR is basically you run the

272
00:09:57,209 --> 00:10:00,810
script it allows both a domain and a txt

273
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,610
file so let's see if you have a txt of

274
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,680
all emails for a company you can just

275
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,060
pass that into the script it will

276
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,850
analyze those or if you give it a domain

277
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,250
it will grab hunter and then you know

278
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,170
use hunter to grab those emails you just

279
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,250
have to make sure you have the hunter

280
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,579
API key so make sure you have that on

281
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:20,069
the hunter API the Python file and you

282
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:23,939
still be able to run it so let's see a

283
00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:25,740
sample so here you have a sample where

284
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,439
I'm showing you the test desta txt file

285
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:30,870
with emails I run that with Cal dot pi

286
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,180
and then you can notice that it defines

287
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,730
all of those are awesome calendars that

288
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:38,250
you can access some of these will go

289
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,589
private today I made them public just

290
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:42,269
for this talk so I will make them

291
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:44,399
private after this talk but you are

292
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,230
definitely for you to try other emails

293
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,939
so if you know company emails if you are

294
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,500
on a pen test and you want to try it out

295
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,660
feel free to you know use those emails

296
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,100
put that in on the script and see if

297
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,170
it'll work and I have modified the

298
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,240
script on this video a little bit that

299
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,980
you guys are seeing because I wanted to

300
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,319
so the real output as it was happening

301
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:03,870
otherwise what the script will do is it

302
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,800
will output the content to the test txt

303
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,279
file now

304
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,610
we covered the exploit part you know as

305
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,649
a hacker it's real easy to exploit and

306
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:17,209
some bug bounty hunter is really easy to

307
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:20,120
find but the problem is knowing how to

308
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,640
fix them that's why when I was creating

309
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,170
this talk when I was discussing with

310
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,690
some of my friends we're thinking so we

311
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,149
covered the aspect of how to fix this

312
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:32,000
because obviously there's no point in us

313
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,649
disclosing a security issue or

314
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:35,959
disclosing things like this that can be

315
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:37,910
mass exploited and not have a fix for

316
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,640
companies so that's why we are each part

317
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,529
of this talk will have an aspect where

318
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:45,470
you can fix this if you are a G suite

319
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,390
adding it for a company so if you are

320
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,700
watching this talk and you work at a

321
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,290
company and you don't you haven't

322
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,329
received a report about gold calendars

323
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:55,370
and you don't know if your Vernal yet

324
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,890
just try this out and make sure your

325
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:03,230
company is secure so for example here we

326
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,600
have a simple g-suit admin panel what

327
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,040
you'll do is once you go to the panel

328
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,070
you can go and search for calendars so

329
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,930
when you look for calendar settings it

330
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,970
shows you the calendar service so how do

331
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,610
suite works is each app is known as a

332
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,620
service and you can turn it on and off

333
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,959
for everyone obviously you don't want to

334
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,399
turn it off for all your employees to

335
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,660
make yourself secure because at that

336
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,360
point no one can use it but what it can

337
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,459
instead do it change the external

338
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:30,829
sharing options now how this works is

339
00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:33,230
let's say employee is super into making

340
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,600
their calendar public there are cases

341
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,459
where those are needed for example if

342
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:39,200
you work in HR if you work in some kind

343
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,690
of a marketing team and you want to late

344
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,760
your client customers know when you are

345
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,649
free and when you're busy so you

346
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:47,930
probably want to calendar public but as

347
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,399
a DC I mean you don't want to employee

348
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:53,800
disclosing meetings to other people so a

349
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,120
perfect way to do that is you'll change

350
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,500
your calendar settings and you'll say

351
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,420
hey you know just make it free slash

352
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,180
busy so what that will do is it was a so

353
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,520
on the public calendar when it's free

354
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,810
and when it's busy so it wouldn't

355
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,670
disclose anything else for example if

356
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,040
you were to go to worse or someone and

357
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,079
if you try putting one of the employees

358
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,300
email even if they have it public it'll

359
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,680
just say when they're free and busy we

360
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,029
doesn't give you any vital information

361
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,940
at all so that's why it's good as a

362
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,839
g-suit admin - you realize this usually

363
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,740
it's not by default turned on

364
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,720
so you probably want to go there and do

365
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,490
that if you do this it will force all

366
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,280
employees that as the maximum Sara

367
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,230
ability because sometimes the employees

368
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,490
can override some of the juice which

369
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,170
settings when they are doing manual

370
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,300
stairs but for this case it will be the

371
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,890
maximum they can do so they won't be

372
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,410
allowed to do any public disclose

373
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,910
information so they won't be able to

374
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,020
disclose meeting details or anything

375
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:51,750
like that and before I move to the other

376
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,000
part of this talk I just want to recap

377
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,340
to the Google Calendar Bart as I said

378
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,440
the script is out there now so you will

379
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,480
be able to use it the script is on bug

380
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,540
bounty - site github account I'll also

381
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,700
probably share my screen and then so the

382
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,350
link after this talk so that you guys

383
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:10,380
can follow up on the talk link or the

384
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,750
tsukuba slides will be made public I'll

385
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,010
probably put it on my Twitter so you

386
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,330
guys will have access to that as well

387
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:18,360
but as I said the script is online you

388
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,190
can just utilize it just make sure you

389
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,050
use it in a way that you don't get rate

390
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,460
limited otherwise you'll get a lot of

391
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,790
false positives out of it and see if you

392
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,560
can find some companies we did find it

393
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,690
on a lot of companies so for example on

394
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,980
the report we mentioned we found it on

395
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,500
uber saw FIFA and others our soft flight

396
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,030
report is actually already disclosed so

397
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,830
if you want to see more detail in it if

398
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,900
you want to go more technical or see

399
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,460
like what kind of impacts we try to

400
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,560
prove it that might be a really good

401
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,860
report to look at now let's look at

402
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,760
private docks

403
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,110
I did mention on the Google Calendar

404
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:51,120
that when you have access to a calendar

405
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,590
probably start looking for Google Docs

406
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,320
and see what you can do with it and the

407
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,410
reason is private dogs need to be remain

408
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:01,020
private right you don't want anyone

409
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,560
random in the internet to access it and

410
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,850
we have found a lot of companies miss

411
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,210
upon that as well so we're kind of

412
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,270
looking at how can a company's like how

413
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,100
often are employees sharing internal

414
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,830
links and giving it to other people

415
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,050
turns out it's a lot so you'll see this

416
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:22,320
this is fine picture on the side on all

417
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,210
of the slides today because pretty much

418
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:26,010
every company is messing up on this and

419
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,470
sadly it's not a fault of a jisu admin

420
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,540
since you probably want to allow ser

421
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,180
dogs but it's when employees share it

422
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,010
with anyone with the link in access and

423
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:37,890
think that it won't go on the public web

424
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,510
when they put it on like trailer

425
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,930
something so let's look at it from

426
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,610
attacker viewpoint before we start

427
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,770
looking at fixing it so one of the

428
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,330
common ways to do it and I have tweeted

429
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,740
about this other hackers have also

430
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,080
tweeted about it is finding internal

431
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,750
links through Google Docs so if you do a

432
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,730
google dork which is basically you are

433
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,620
giving it a certain parameters to

434
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,110
specifically look for you'll say in in

435
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:04,650
text find every links that have mention

436
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:08,070
google.com slash a slash company com

437
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,020
so for example if it's Buckra a little B

438
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,810
slash bar of calm and you'll probably

439
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,790
see you know you're probably pasted on

440
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,350
Google and then try to see what it does

441
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,560
right so when you do in text it will try

442
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,940
to mention everything and it's not just

443
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,310
a dark side wall comma do list you'll

444
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,580
also see groups Volcom you'll see other

445
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,560
cool links that this company is using

446
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,440
and sometimes it is pretty interesting

447
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,500
to test out on Google and see what kind

448
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,750
of links you'll find so for example if

449
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,120
you want to go and find for DoD you go

450
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,710
try that for the DoD since they have a

451
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,470
PDP and see if you can report that I

452
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,220
know for sure

453
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,140
uber also had some of those incidents in

454
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,970
the past we did find those issues and

455
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,550
report it to them but as I said the

456
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,100
problem is like you cannot enforce this

457
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,950
perfectly in Google so or in G suite so

458
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,600
you have just have to monitor these

459
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,940
things and we'll cover that on the

460
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,550
defense point of view some website that

461
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,230
are useful you can look at also if

462
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,940
you're not using Google Dirk is pasted

463
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:09,000
that same query in github since yeah if

464
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,099
there are github issues get up comets

465
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,290
they might mention that saying based on

466
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,990
this Google Doc for our company here see

467
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,359
how it works right and you can probably

468
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,800
try to find some internal links with

469
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,050
that

470
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:25,349
another one is Trello a hacker I forgot

471
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:28,170
his name now couple months ago found

472
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,000
that employees were sharing a lot of

473
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,800
sensitive data on Trello and one of them

474
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,230
definitely is Google Docs since they

475
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,230
will crea like internal cards internal

476
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,630
tasks and then put it on a trailer

477
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,160
instance and then they'll start sharing

478
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,380
Google Docs based on that task so even

479
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,030
though trailer won't have much sensitive

480
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,680
data for that task if you click on the

481
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,570
Google Doc you can see like meeting

482
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,940
details you can see product reviews we

483
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,190
have found for a specific company

484
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,530
cannot mention the name but basically

485
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,840
we're able to get their Google Doc that

486
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,810
had all upcoming products till 2020 so

487
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,700
basically accessing every upcoming

488
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,710
features out there and we already know

489
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,380
what this features will cover so you'll

490
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,150
usually find this kind of info and as I

491
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,340
said before it's not necessarily a

492
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,900
critical issue right away you can

493
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,570
probably even escalate it further we

494
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,400
have found internal links within Google

495
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,500
Docs so when you find a Google Doc that

496
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,330
you can access probably look for

497
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:22,800
different things you can find there and

498
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,640
you start querying

499
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,590
look at the Google Doc obviously don't

500
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,390
download it just look at it from the

501
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:30,000
online point of view and see if you can

502
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,010
find internal links we have found

503
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,470
internal links that no one could find

504
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,690
since that it was a random thing at the

505
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:39,150
end and random thing at the start but if

506
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,530
you click on it it was accessible to

507
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,510
everyone and you could login so there

508
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,640
are like you can go from a medium

509
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,040
severity just finding a cool dog to put

510
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,870
into a critical by logging into their

511
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,820
internal instance which probably has a

512
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,130
lot more sensitive info and another

513
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:57,060
quick example is PAP al wipe appellee

514
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:00,120
it's a own bookmark thing not a lot of

515
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,220
people use it but we have seen a lot of

516
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,530
companies have employees that are

517
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,870
personally using it and they will say

518
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:10,050
like some internal links the picture I'm

519
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:13,410
going to so next has a lot of

520
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,180
information but you won't be able to

521
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,500
access any of those Google Docs you'll

522
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,030
just be able to see the name so there's

523
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,970
no point in reporting so for example

524
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,800
this one is an example of us getting to

525
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,660
some of the links this were Google

526
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,640
slides for onboarding new employees and

527
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,220
also onboarding new features for March

528
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,340
2019 and then we also have for Ober

529
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,430
here's a employee that had mentioned all

530
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:38,280
of their trackers all of their documents

531
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,380
names and stuff but all these are

532
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,450
private since goober kind of forces

533
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,850
employees to not see them since they do

534
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,130
have monitors and audit logs and all of

535
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,690
those so that's why I say this picture

536
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,490
is there's not a lot of sensitive data

537
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,680
coming out of this but definitely for

538
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,970
example some of the internal links you

539
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:56,100
can use that to do more recon so

540
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,930
sometimes just finding these data are

541
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,880
not worth reporting I just want to

542
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,260
highlight there so that you guys like

543
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,220
anyone watching it

544
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,630
listen create a lot of noise for

545
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,640
companies but definitely use this to see

546
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,900
if you can find more

547
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,430
out of the Recon and then try more

548
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:11,640
attack vectors from it so how do you

549
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,370
actually fix this right because as I

550
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,110
said there's no point in disclosing this

551
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,760
and then telling the company good luck

552
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,580
so what do you actually do is in Google

553
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,250
you can create alerts and audits so when

554
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,200
you go to your homepage and click on the

555
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,540
menu bar it has an option for reporting

556
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,660
audits and alerts so on the audit

557
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,400
section you select will drive which

558
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,300
makes it easier and then you'll select

559
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,190
anything that has the visibility change

560
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,550
from internal to external so for example

561
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,050
here you'll see I have a couple of

562
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,570
documents one of them was anyone in it

563
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,540
with the link within the domain to

564
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,910
private for Sakura Inc so you can also

565
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,530
have only people within the domain to

566
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,690
access it if they have a link you can

567
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,190
also make it private for a specific

568
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,590
domain and they're also like none to can

569
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,410
edit so when you share files and if your

570
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,750
g-suit admin you can utilize this to see

571
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,760
if employees are externally sharing

572
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,300
files to other individuals and you can

573
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,770
even see the logs of who are accessing

574
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,320
it so it makes it easier if you get a

575
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,510
report if you are working in the g-suit

576
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,040
admin section for a company and you get

577
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,570
a hacker one or a buck or a report that

578
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,670
says I got access to all of your Doc's

579
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,890
that has VPN quest that has password all

580
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,170
of these sensitive info you can use this

581
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,820
to actually get the locks of that and

582
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,890
see if someone had exploited this in the

583
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,440
past or even the hacker reporting it's

584
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,450
not reporting you all things needed so

585
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:37,980
now before I'm moving to the other

586
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,260
section I do know there are some

587
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,470
questions that were asked on the chat so

588
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,760
I'm just going to quickly answer one of

589
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,680
them someone asked if we could share the

590
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,930
calendar script it is already public on

591
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,540
the background EDS site so I will show

592
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,640
the link at the end of the presentation

593
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,530
here so you'll have access to it even

594
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:59,070
after the slides but let's move on to

595
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:03,150
the next one Google Sites now this is

596
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:06,180
where the fun actually is if I were to

597
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,130
say it because we have found things on

598
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,780
Google Sites recently due to a new

599
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,150
change that Google added that not a lot

600
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:16,200
of people realize has happened yet so

601
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,270
internal informations are always fun

602
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,010
Vasili in Google Sites you find a lot of

603
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:20,700
crazy

604
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,210
I'll say a lot of internal infos

605
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:26,970
onboarding datas VPN creds we have found

606
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,460
internal login informations and olives

607
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,150
so the question is new Google Sites came

608
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,310
out so how can we exploit this what

609
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,770
happened was originally I was full of

610
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:40,380
comparison in a while is there was an

611
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,750
old Google site that allowed you to link

612
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,430
or see all the google sites a company

613
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,350
had and then Google decided to make a

614
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:49,020
new design with new features on it so if

615
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,820
you go to secure if you go to my blog

616
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,800
which is on secure firing comps at SEC

617
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,780
blocks it is using the new Google site

618
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,300
version that's when I was looking at it

619
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,860
and looks super interesting to see how

620
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,010
it works so this results can a new

621
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,780
exploit that not a lot of companies are

622
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:07,380
aware of so let's compare the old versus

623
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,550
new Google site right now

624
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,980
so the old one for example if you were

625
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,480
to go for uber you'll go to

626
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,690
sites.google.com slash a slash over comm

627
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,940
and what this will do is it will show

628
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,920
you my sites in uber and since you're

629
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,750
not an employee you don't have any sites

630
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,730
but if you click on browse sites it will

631
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,380
list you all public sites that it can

632
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,570
access so this was in the old version of

633
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:29,070
Google Sites and it was super easy right

634
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,530
you don't have to guess a company's

635
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,330
google site link you don't have to do

636
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,250
anything you just go click on browse if

637
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,990
it's public you see it and see if

638
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:39,240
there's sensitive data there for most of

639
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,620
the companies we cannot find a lot of

640
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,540
sensitive data on this cases because

641
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,670
those are user like public data there

642
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,040
they are sharing with customers in case

643
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,570
of uber it was with drivers and riders

644
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,210
so it'll be like coupons

645
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,560
it'll be upcoming events referral

646
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,780
programs and all that so those were not

647
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:58,350
sensitive but then Google decided to add

648
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:01,110
a new Google Sites feature so now all of

649
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,880
the Google sites link if you're using a

650
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,390
new Google site is sites Google com

651
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:08,490
slash over coms last the title of the

652
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,530
block so it is not something you can

653
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:12,990
easily list for all the come all for a

654
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,760
company or like all of the Google Sites

655
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,650
so you'll have to actually brute force

656
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,900
it but then at the same time one thing

657
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,640
googled it easier is on the old Google

658
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,470
Sites if you were to try to find these

659
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,090
by brute forcing it you have to make

660
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:25,620
sure you're logged in to your Google

661
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,960
account right so if you need a gmail or

662
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,280
anything you'll just need to be logged

663
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,020
in with at least one account in Google

664
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:34,280
and then you can view these things

665
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,230
so what Google did was it made it easier

666
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,700
to brute-force with the new one so you

667
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,590
can just have a W first link with a

668
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:43,140
destiny of files and then brute force it

669
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,730
for that company so here's an example

670
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,970
for secure Viacom that I utilized to

671
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:50,100
test all of these things is you'll pass

672
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,620
in the rough large directories which is

673
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,470
a simple online brute force directory

674
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,660
from SEC list and you'll look for all

675
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,510
the 200 content out there so 200 means

676
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,549
these sites are publicly accessible with

677
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:04,410
anyone you don't even have to be logged

678
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,870
in and you'll go to site so cool calm

679
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:09,090
Satsuki fine calm and then fuzz that and

680
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,950
you can seen the result we have minimum

681
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:14,039
of like four that were found so if you

682
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:16,260
want to test it I have some flags on

683
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,440
this Google Sites for my domain so you

684
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,480
if you test the script if you want to

685
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,190
run those you'll be able to find them

686
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,750
there there are some Google Docs or

687
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,220
Google Sites that have made just for

688
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,260
people to test it out and see if it

689
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,330
works for them so this one is really

690
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,520
nice to have and you're really easy to

691
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,919
test as well so just run AWS and you

692
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:37,429
have access to a lot of sensitive info

693
00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:40,169
we did test it on a company I asked for

694
00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:41,669
permission from the company when I was

695
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:43,440
doing this presentation and they

696
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,150
declined to be mentioned so I won't be

697
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:48,000
able to mention their name but it's a

698
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,070
it's a really useful thing to test out

699
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,600
on all the companies that you're part of

700
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,809
and one thing I recommend corporate

701
00:25:53,809 --> 00:25:56,370
employees so if you're a bug bounty

702
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:58,440
manager working for companies to

703
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,320
actually try to add g-suit security to

704
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,690
your bug bounty measures there are a

705
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,610
couple of companies that do that so i'd

706
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:07,049
like to give a shout out to Netflix

707
00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:09,320
series they recently added that on their

708
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,179
bug crowd briefing where they mentioned

709
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:14,039
that if you find a security issue under

710
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,900
G's would convict so not a security

711
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,940
issue on G suite but something specific

712
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,650
to Netflix they will pay bounties for

713
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:21,570
that so for example if you are able to

714
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,850
find their internal groups that equal

715
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,530
access they'll pay you bounties for

716
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,840
those as well so I'll request like if

717
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,490
companies can do it this is a really

718
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,679
good measure to tech because if you

719
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,090
realize like as I have sowed in the

720
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:35,130
pictures here there are a lot of

721
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,990
sensitive infos that these dogs could

722
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,450
have even though they won't give you a

723
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:42,570
full critical impact it is not that hard

724
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:44,429
that once you deep dive into this that

725
00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:46,799
you can use info from these dogs and

726
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:47,250
link

727
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,570
to other places and actually get a

728
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:51,630
critical out of this so now how do you

729
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:54,170
actually fix this and this is kind of a

730
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:57,330
bad part for the new Google Sites is

731
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:00,120
there's no easy way to fix because what

732
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,030
Google did is the and integrated the new

733
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,830
Google Sites into Google Drive so what

734
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,450
that means is previously is Google site

735
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,580
was a site in itself so you could have

736
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,620
security measures implemented on G suite

737
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,290
but with the new one is actually a file

738
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:15,450
in your Google Drive so companies cannot

739
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:18,000
say that all G suite new Google Sites

740
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,190
have to be private because there's no

741
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:22,200
way to restrict that in a way what

742
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,250
you'll have to do is you have to

743
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,410
restrict permission sharing in Google

744
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,860
Drive itself and limit it through that

745
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:32,550
so that's kind of a bad thing for some

746
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,840
of the companies it's really hard to

747
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,790
prevent this and one thing else

748
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,680
recommend is using the previous idea I

749
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,480
sort of about Google Docs is auditing

750
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,300
these and monitoring changes on the file

751
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,370
permission chains and actually fixing it

752
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:44,970
based on that

753
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,290
so you could send emails to your

754
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,120
employees saying we just noticed that

755
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,920
you have disclosed this you know Google

756
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,780
site to the public what is going on why

757
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,750
are you doing this and the past places

758
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,400
that I have worked we did actually do

759
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,350
those to make sure employees when the

760
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,940
shared files we were alerted of that so

761
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,500
if you're on security team probably

762
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,450
start creating alerts to get monitored

763
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:06,420
for those and try to see if we can find

764
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,070
other companies doing it and report it

765
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,050
to them as well so I would like to do it

766
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:12,330
in conclusion real quick this was not

767
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,160
that long of a presentation because I

768
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,420
wanted to answer some poisonous people

769
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,930
probably have in the conclusion going

770
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,820
over Google Calendar real quick most

771
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,680
companies have public calendars X civil

772
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,540
for all so it's super easy to test and

773
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,780
what I'll recommend is once you find a

774
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,280
Google Calendar with the script or

775
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,140
something go to your personal calendar

776
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,390
and import it there since Google allows

777
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,160
that and what you can do from there is

778
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,080
you can actually search that calendar so

779
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,730
there are previous things that they had

780
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,590
public like their meetings their

781
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,360
upcoming meeting links you can search

782
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,460
them by string so once you have added a

783
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,770
you go search for like resume and see if

784
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,480
there are candidates like interview

785
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,520
candidates whose info you can get out of

786
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,860
it or if there are zoom links that you

787
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,290
can publicly access and then access to

788
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:58,950
their meetings from that so find zoom

789
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,460
links Google Docs internal

790
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,080
swerd I actually mentioned we had a

791
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,029
story for that so what happened is a

792
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:06,249
company we're testing we didn't find

793
00:29:06,249 --> 00:29:07,659
this in a lot of companies but one

794
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:09,850
company specifically we decided to see

795
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,379
if they have a password so he put

796
00:29:11,379 --> 00:29:12,610
password on it and we were like all

797
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:13,659
right let's see if we can get something

798
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:16,210
out of it and there was one link that

799
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:17,860
came out was just super interesting like

800
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:24,009
it had a Google Calendar with a username

801
00:29:24,009 --> 00:29:26,049
and a password on it for an external

802
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:28,149
link that was being used so it was a

803
00:29:28,149 --> 00:29:29,980
third party the company was using to

804
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,570
store some of their videos so there was

805
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,249
interview candidates and they'll store

806
00:29:33,249 --> 00:29:35,259
the videos there and since it was shared

807
00:29:35,259 --> 00:29:36,759
with other employees they wanted to make

808
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:38,169
sure everyone could log in so they

809
00:29:38,169 --> 00:29:39,610
decided let's just put the password in

810
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,740
the calendar easier for everybody and

811
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,299
one of the employee had the calendar

812
00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:45,669
public so when we logged in we could

813
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:47,350
access all the videos for interview

814
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:51,129
candidates for their better release for

815
00:29:51,129 --> 00:29:53,139
their password also like if they're

816
00:29:53,139 --> 00:29:54,700
hiring someone you can find those links

817
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,879
as well and the tool as I said it's

818
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,590
already public I think Ben already

819
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,299
posted the link as well there so you can

820
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,580
find it on github.com so that's a bug

821
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:06,669
bounty des cités last Cali XE I'll also

822
00:30:06,669 --> 00:30:08,499
highlight the bug bounty that site is

823
00:30:08,499 --> 00:30:10,509
expect to see more tools coming out of

824
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:12,399
that it's a resource project I'm working

825
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:13,990
with a couple of friends so we will be

826
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:16,629
posting a lot of new exploits for like

827
00:30:16,629 --> 00:30:18,340
things like Google Calendar or any other

828
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,659
research that we do so there are a

829
00:30:19,659 --> 00:30:21,909
couple of the experts in the pipeline

830
00:30:21,909 --> 00:30:23,590
there right now that we probably will

831
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:26,080
discuss in a couple of months so be no

832
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,899
lookout for those as well for Google

833
00:30:28,899 --> 00:30:32,590
dogs as I said most documents are shared

834
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,179
in a way that's accessible by anyone

835
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:36,519
with the link and the point is employees

836
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:39,100
try to think that if I sear this you

837
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,269
know if I create this in a way that only

838
00:30:40,269 --> 00:30:42,129
people with Lincoln access it's secure

839
00:30:42,129 --> 00:30:43,720
right because the link is hard to guess

840
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,720
but what is not realized and out in

841
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,850
those matters is someone could put that

842
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,259
on Trello or someone could put that

843
00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:52,929
somewhere that got googled or cool so it

844
00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:55,029
so for an attacker it's a perfect point

845
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:56,350
of view where you can just grab it and

846
00:30:56,350 --> 00:31:00,399
then attack it from there so as I said

847
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,350
look for you can either look for dot

848
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:04,629
Google Chrome slash a slash dohman calm

849
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,610
or you could go for docs.google.com

850
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:10,059
slash a slash Dillman calm because dogs

851
00:31:10,059 --> 00:31:11,740
will want to show you Google Docs if you

852
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,590
just do all calm

853
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:16,260
you'll see more of groups you will see

854
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,419
spread sits slides and all of those as

855
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:20,400
well so there are like more things you

856
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,070
can access with that I pretty

857
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,590
super-sensitive report it as I said if

858
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,600
not try to escalate it do not report

859
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,510
like if it comes to it yes it could be a

860
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:32,039
medium and you could report it but I'll

861
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:34,110
always recommend using the info there to

862
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,240
actually try to get a critical as I

863
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,799
mentioned before you can find internal

864
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,929
links so try going to those and see even

865
00:31:39,929 --> 00:31:41,429
if you can't log in like if they're

866
00:31:41,429 --> 00:31:42,809
credits for those links you could

867
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:44,429
probably try to log in with credits and

868
00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:46,799
once you do you have a full critical

869
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,240
there most of the time because these

870
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,429
links will have sensitive info we have

871
00:31:50,429 --> 00:31:52,020
had where we could log in get access to

872
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,390
all the user info for a company since it

873
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,370
was an internal admin panel so you

874
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:58,260
probably want to check those out and see

875
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,750
if you can escalate to the max do not

876
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,340
make the mistake we did is we will

877
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,080
sometimes report it right as soon as we

878
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,669
found it and it will get marked as a

879
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:07,320
medium then when we go back we're like

880
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,789
nevermind we can get it to a critical

881
00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:10,770
here we go and we give them more info

882
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:13,230
afterwards but I feel like it's better

883
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:15,090
to actually escalate it at first before

884
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:17,070
you even report it because it's easier

885
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,809
for companies to actually read the

886
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:20,870
report see what the issue is and then

887
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,980
categorize it for their internal fix

888
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,690
because when you send a report at first

889
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:27,090
and if it's a medium at first like if

890
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:28,860
you have an escalated yet then might

891
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,390
categories at medium and then start

892
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,380
fixing it based on that

893
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,690
compared to you actually escalating into

894
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,220
critical at first and them actually

895
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,909
fixing it right away

896
00:32:37,909 --> 00:32:40,559
another thing is Google Sites as I said

897
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,049
wfos is super easy there is other there

898
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:45,090
are other directory brute force so study

899
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:47,279
guides can use I just tend to use W but

900
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,020
since it's easier it's easy to install

901
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,539
and it has other stuff where you can

902
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:53,490
import it to Python scripts and actually

903
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:57,510
create automated tools out of those so

904
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,730
you can use a dictionary file I have

905
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,110
shown some of the links you can just

906
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,429
send a distant file and then send it to

907
00:33:02,429 --> 00:33:04,470
Google silence and then brute force

908
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,059
links out of those so in my case is

909
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:08,340
secure Viacom just put other links on

910
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,919
there and you'll be able to find those

911
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:14,010
so that's pretty much from my side I'll

912
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:17,070
try to see if I can show you guys the

913
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:21,059
github link so as you can I just can see

914
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:22,710
this is a super easy to square use

915
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:25,260
script so we have the hunter API the py

916
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,549
file and this is where you have to

917
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:29,799
your script um if you want to make it

918
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,259
safer just use the environment variables

919
00:33:32,259 --> 00:33:33,669
for Python and then you'll be able to

920
00:33:33,669 --> 00:33:35,830
just export your API key as environment

921
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:38,049
on your terminal on your Linux bass

922
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:40,330
whatever you use and then directly use

923
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:42,669
the tool so how the tool works is you'll

924
00:33:42,669 --> 00:33:45,190
just specify Python 3 it's a Python 3

925
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,639
applicable tool and then the domain and

926
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:50,679
output dot txt where it saves it if you

927
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:52,419
already have a list of emails just

928
00:33:52,419 --> 00:33:54,730
passing the txt file and then the output

929
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:56,739
txt file and it will be able to scan it

930
00:33:56,739 --> 00:33:59,700
for those sewing in how it works

931
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,070
it's a super simple logic it checks if

932
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:05,019
it's a txt file if it is it will go

933
00:34:05,019 --> 00:34:07,539
through the txt check all of the links

934
00:34:07,539 --> 00:34:09,879
that it can and if it does it will start

935
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:12,699
writing it to a file that's already

936
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:15,010
created so that's the output file that

937
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:17,319
you pass in if it's an email it will use

938
00:34:17,319 --> 00:34:20,379
the hunter API functionality that's on

939
00:34:20,379 --> 00:34:22,179
the get emails function and it will get

940
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:24,129
all the emails out there the one thing

941
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:26,760
that will probably be a disadvantage is

942
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:32,469
you can probably try stuff like you can

943
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:35,349
try this with Hunter API but the problem

944
00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:37,210
is if you are not getting a growth link

945
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:39,520
or something like that it will not work

946
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,839
because you want to get all the emails

947
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:43,629
so that's probably gonna be a bad aspect

948
00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:44,980
of it is you might not have all the

949
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,510
emails of a company's since hunter will

950
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,549
limit that and I kind of wanted to

951
00:34:48,549 --> 00:34:50,619
mention what Ben also wrote is you can

952
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:52,329
use burp intruder for this for sure we

953
00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:55,418
used burp intruder at first so it's a

954
00:34:55,418 --> 00:34:57,250
easier way to use burp intruder if you

955
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,589
don't want to install tools just passing

956
00:34:59,589 --> 00:35:01,059
all the emails that you have so with

957
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:03,369
hunter you can even export a CSV file so

958
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:05,140
you can directly import it on a burp

959
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,150
suite and then start running scans with

960
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:09,220
the intruder but as I said before make

961
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,980
sure to try to go not beyond the rate

962
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,079
limit because that'll probably hinder

963
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,680
your work so the rate limiting is pretty

964
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,970
fast

965
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:20,799
in Google Calendar now so you probably

966
00:35:20,799 --> 00:35:22,240
want to make sure you are threading it

967
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,250
properly you are doing if you need to do

968
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,960
timeouts you're doing those properly as

969
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,549
well because if you look at this group

970
00:35:27,549 --> 00:35:28,990
right now the script doesn't cover that

971
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,520
it just hits all of these requests with

972
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,010
the head call and then just see if it's

973
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:36,220
valid or not that's for the calendar yet

974
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:39,099
see I also wanted to mention for Google

975
00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:40,750
Sites you can also use intruder for that

976
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,470
so you don't miss

977
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,840
wfsu can also pass all the directories

978
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,000
there and then just make a hit for that

979
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,070
specific domain so that's another good

980
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:50,890
way to approach this as well I think

981
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,510
that's all I wanted to cover for this

982
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:55,480
talk if there's any questions I have you

983
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,310
guys have I'm free to answer that I have

984
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:59,619
this talk booked till 11:00 I believe so

985
00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:02,200
we are like half an hour early so feel

986
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,150
free to ask any questions I'll try to

987
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,170
start answering them

988
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:08,170
I think someone asked about AG suite

989
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:10,660
takeover so I'm not actually sure what

990
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,030
that means but I know in the past what

991
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:17,109
you could do is you could take over G

992
00:36:17,109 --> 00:36:19,450
suite accounts in a way where there was

993
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:22,030
a security issue on G suit itself where

994
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,280
you could redirect a company's email to

995
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,840
another instance or a company's domain

996
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,090
to another instance so that is no longer

997
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:30,580
possible there are cases where I have

998
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,430
seen people try to report things like I

999
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:36,310
have I can claim X Dot company common G

1000
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,359
suite and you won't be able to sign up

1001
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,580
anymore but the thing is those are not a

1002
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,990
security issue in a way because

1003
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,760
companies can just reach out to Google

1004
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,500
and let them know and get that account

1005
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,540
closed and re-register if they need to

1006
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,119
do it so if that's the D Street takeover

1007
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,619
you're mentioning even though it's

1008
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:52,630
possible it's not a security issue but

1009
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,040
if you do find a way to redirect your

1010
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,780
company's domain a email or anything

1011
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,080
like that from G suite to other places

1012
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,330
then you'll probably want to report that

1013
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:03,609
to Google I'll just highlight something

1014
00:37:03,609 --> 00:37:06,480
let me see if I can load that real quick

1015
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,770
regarding G sweety's I had that similar

1016
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:14,200
incident if you guys before my username

1017
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,060
used to be uranium hacker on hacker 1

1018
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,500
but if you guys check the disclosure

1019
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,839
reports that I had there was one with

1020
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:22,839
uber where you called authorized issue

1021
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:25,089
in G suite so what happened was I was

1022
00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:28,000
able to redirect ubereats calm to a

1023
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,890
different domain or a different

1024
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:32,589
subdomain up theirs and basically it

1025
00:37:32,589 --> 00:37:33,970
allowed for me to transfer it to other

1026
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:39,070
places so the worst part for this is it

1027
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,930
was a Google bug as well so I have to

1028
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,250
report it to Google so in those cases

1029
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:44,020
keep in mind of like what you're finding

1030
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,030
the Google Sites Google counters and

1031
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,830
Google Docs kind of miss convicts are

1032
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,990
not something Google has to fix since

1033
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,849
they already have a feature for it so

1034
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:54,220
it's more for companies to fix it on

1035
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,380
themselves and those you

1036
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,990
rapport but if it's things like where

1037
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:00,180
you can redirect a whole domain or where

1038
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,099
you can snoop into emails with that so

1039
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:03,630
Jesus would had a Verne ability where

1040
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:06,089
you call if a company had an emic set to

1041
00:38:06,089 --> 00:38:07,980
google.com or whatever G search requires

1042
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,109
and it was not registering this would

1043
00:38:10,109 --> 00:38:12,630
already you'll just go and sign up as

1044
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,579
that domain and you'll be able to listen

1045
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:16,500
to all the emails coming into it since

1046
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,670
they didn't have valid that you actually

1047
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,529
own the domain or not and those things

1048
00:38:19,529 --> 00:38:21,119
you actually want to report to Google

1049
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,980
and not to the company's guts it's not

1050
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,619
something they can prevent hopefully

1051
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:27,269
that answers that question if anyone has

1052
00:38:27,269 --> 00:38:28,920
questions about other things about G

1053
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,720
suite there are other things you can

1054
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,630
find with this with miss convicts there

1055
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,980
are still like kind of private and I'm

1056
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,359
still looking into those more so I'll

1057
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:38,369
probably add more of those in the slides

1058
00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:39,900
or anything else in the future and

1059
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,759
probably tweet about them so they'll

1060
00:38:41,759 --> 00:38:43,740
really fall on the Twitter account and

1061
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,119
I'll be able to share more details there

1062
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,809
as well let me see I don't think there's

1063
00:38:48,809 --> 00:38:50,490
any more questions on the chat if there

1064
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:54,720
is I'm happy to answer them yeah

1065
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,460
everyone that's watching you guys can

1066
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,950
throw in questions in the chat and like

1067
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,660
Rohan said we can just fill in the next

1068
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,480
20 minutes riffing on questions so it

1069
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,009
looks like we just got one in actually

1070
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,589
yes so it seems like someone's asking

1071
00:39:07,589 --> 00:39:09,269
about token api's with like if the

1072
00:39:09,269 --> 00:39:10,859
Google Doc has it or if a Google

1073
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:12,150
Calendar has it ah

1074
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:15,480
if you cannot verify it so some of the

1075
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,190
token API is you can probably test it

1076
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,509
out so if these are Dropbox slack

1077
00:39:18,509 --> 00:39:20,880
mailgun or anything try it out and then

1078
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,740
see if it works but if it does not and

1079
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,809
if you can't verify it I'll recommend

1080
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:26,759
still reporting it to some extent so

1081
00:39:26,759 --> 00:39:28,710
like let them know on Hacker on a buck

1082
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:30,869
route but do expect that it won't always

1083
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:37,260
be a critical right away and you

1084
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,910
want to be careful about like how you're

1085
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,950
reporting it to you right so don try to

1086
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,810
go as out of scope as possible

1087
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:44,760
obviously if it's something really bad

1088
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,430
then you probably want to report it

1089
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:49,200
right away so if it's a token you Canada

1090
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,310
use I'll say it will be a medium

1091
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:52,350
severity depending on the company so not

1092
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,580
always a guarantee that it will be a

1093
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,950
critical that's like like a look at the

1094
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,540
doc more see if you can find more info

1095
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,190
of it

1096
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:01,620
someone asked why a doc Sagwa comes to

1097
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:06,990
us ASIS that is going to SSO so with the

1098
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,480
Google Docs how it works is specifically

1099
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,690
that link that is shared that's just a

1100
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:14,850
link to load Google Docs so it's not

1101
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:17,430
actually loading the documents directly

1102
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:19,440
so those will depend on how they're G

1103
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,020
suite login works for example if you

1104
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,310
work on a company site you'll know that

1105
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:25,470
you can have octa and Wan log in and

1106
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:27,420
then make those log into Google accounts

1107
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,190
so that's why it's probably going to

1108
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:31,740
that Microsoft account is you have a the

1109
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,680
company has an SSL where it says you

1110
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,510
have to log in at Microsoft first and it

1111
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,800
will actually let you log in to all the

1112
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,870
apps we have and c-suite each one of

1113
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:42,360
those apps so it will have a similar

1114
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,610
release on sites that google coms that's

1115
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:47,190
a slash Dillman calm and you probably

1116
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,020
want to make sure that you don't

1117
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,150
actually just rely on that and say hey

1118
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,740
they have ISO so it won't variable

1119
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,570
because I documents can still be public

1120
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:56,160
so the end point anything you want to

1121
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,170
look at is the document links directly

1122
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:00,960
not just google.com slash a slash domain

1123
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,080
calm yeah that's a great point the link

1124
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,940
that for those watching on the stream

1125
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,470
later the link that was shared in the

1126
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,660
twitch chat was docs.google.com

1127
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,990
slash a slash you know whatever domain

1128
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:16,290
that is the company like so for example

1129
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:19,680
would be bugcrowd calm like real han was

1130
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,750
saying you can't just like go to that

1131
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:24,990
and necessarily load up the docs because

1132
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:27,720
it's going to go to a login flow and in

1133
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,960
this case the user in the chat tried it

1134
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,480
and it went to Microsoft or like Rohan

1135
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,130
was saying it could go to octa or

1136
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:37,980
something else so that's how that kind

1137
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,940
of login flow works

1138
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:44,260
see if we have any other questions and

1139
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:49,200
chat hmm

1140
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:54,400
do you work from your local machine or

1141
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,609
you do you use a VPS set up and work

1142
00:41:57,609 --> 00:42:00,520
from that so we do have a VPS Center for

1143
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,990
this instead of a local and the reason

1144
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:04,119
is as I mentioned there will be rate

1145
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:06,640
limits so we didn't want our IP to get

1146
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,990
banned specifically about Google

1147
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:10,329
calendars and stuff since if we get the

1148
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:11,920
IP banned we're pretty much banned out

1149
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,589
of Google so it kind of feels suck

1150
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:17,140
that's one reason why we do use a VPS

1151
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:17,619
set up

1152
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:19,690
you won't need a really crazy VPS set up

1153
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:21,280
you can get us simple like Ally node

1154
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,380
instance for things like five dollars a

1155
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,210
month and you'll be able to use that to

1156
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,280
run the basic scripts these facility

1157
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,069
things like the Kali XE or w fuss those

1158
00:42:30,069 --> 00:42:32,319
won't take a lot of memory space or take

1159
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,440
a lot of like God uses from your VPS so

1160
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,609
you won't have to worry about running

1161
00:42:36,609 --> 00:42:38,079
out of bandwidth or running out of

1162
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,829
memories on those

1163
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:56,880
for wfos usually not there are people

1164
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,890
who have specific files they create

1165
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:01,140
themselves so I'll say once you start

1166
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,540
noticing a pattern for sure do that and

1167
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,880
create their own directories or addition

1168
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,630
Ares out of it

1169
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:09,330
for a start I just tend to use raft -

1170
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:12,000
Lars - directory start txt from SEC list

1171
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
since it has most of the files or the

1172
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,970
distance that I need and I just tend to

1173
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,440
run that and if I see a pattern then

1174
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,360
I'll try to create it based on those so

1175
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,850
for example just throwing it out like if

1176
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:26,280
a company has all their Google Sites

1177
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,280
title named after a food name or

1178
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,080
something right then you probably just

1179
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,120
want to have a dysentery file or a txt

1180
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,490
file with bunch of food names and try

1181
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:37,590
those and then see if it'll work because

1182
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:39,360
if it does then you'll just be fine like

1183
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,410
you won't have to create other noise

1184
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:43,380
you'll get a higher rate of success so

1185
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,790
most of your links will come out being

1186
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:46,890
valid instead of just sending circulars

1187
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,420
link and then getting a lot of invalid

1188
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,790
links out of it so it just depends on if

1189
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:52,290
you see a pattern created on dition

1190
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:56,029
areas otherwise any distance okay fine

1191
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:11,130
you

1192
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,640
you

1193
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:34,839
thank you yeah it has it has been a

1194
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:37,029
really fun thing like the reason I

1195
00:44:37,029 --> 00:44:38,410
wanted to give a talk is when he worked

1196
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:40,779
on a specific company in buck rod I was

1197
00:44:40,779 --> 00:44:43,239
like this could get pretty bad for all

1198
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:44,680
other companies as well so might as well

1199
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,319
let all the hackers know it's useful and

1200
00:44:47,319 --> 00:44:48,549
at the same time cover it for a

1201
00:44:48,549 --> 00:44:50,799
corporate part so as I have mentioned

1202
00:44:50,799 --> 00:44:53,079
like if you work in a company and you

1203
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:54,670
have Jesus we probably start looking

1204
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:56,259
into how to secure it since that is the

1205
00:44:56,259 --> 00:44:58,089
biggest I'll say one of the biggest

1206
00:44:58,089 --> 00:44:59,589
attack vectors at this point because

1207
00:44:59,589 --> 00:45:01,089
there's a lot of things that people

1208
00:45:01,089 --> 00:45:06,729
could access with it awesome well if

1209
00:45:06,729 --> 00:45:08,829
folks have in the twitch chat have any

1210
00:45:08,829 --> 00:45:10,329
more questions feel free to throw them

1211
00:45:10,329 --> 00:45:13,719
in and while we've got it got them here

1212
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:17,769
on the stream otherwise we can fill in

1213
00:45:17,769 --> 00:45:20,289
the next you know 10 15 minutes and

1214
00:45:20,289 --> 00:45:23,349
other ways to and you can also always

1215
00:45:23,349 --> 00:45:25,239
like message me on Twitter I think my DM

1216
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:27,789
is always open so you can feel free to

1217
00:45:27,789 --> 00:45:29,709
hit me up on uranium hacker on Twitter

1218
00:45:29,709 --> 00:45:31,269
and I can answer questions there as well

1219
00:45:31,269 --> 00:45:33,640
use a light trend to respond pretty fast

1220
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,589
it's just if you don't hear a response

1221
00:45:35,589 --> 00:45:36,969
for me it's probably because the message

1222
00:45:36,969 --> 00:45:39,759
went to Twitter spam filter that they

1223
00:45:39,759 --> 00:45:41,559
tend to have so it probably will take me

1224
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:44,430
some time at that point

1225
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,880
all right then um I guess we'll we'll

1226
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,690
move on thank you so much everyone

1227
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:57,300
please throw whatever emoji you want to

1228
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,280
use in chat throw it in there Oh

1229
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,170
actually we're already getting we just

1230
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:04,050
got some more questions and so maybe we

1231
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:05,460
can keep it going here cuz it looks like

1232
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,280
we just got two right there the first

1233
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,520
one was um well actually let's go for

1234
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,410
the the second one that came in and then

1235
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:15,960
we'll go to the first one so the wolf

1236
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:19,350
Droid asked when finding bugs in github

1237
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:21,660
like information regarding people a

1238
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:24,000
company let's see

1239
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,650
trying to decipher what their question

1240
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:27,780
is how to be sure when you're finding

1241
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:31,830
that information yeah I think the

1242
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,600
question is more of like if you get this

1243
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,730
if you get a token in github or if you

1244
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:37,350
find something about an employee like

1245
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:39,300
through an employee of a company I'd get

1246
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,520
up like how do you realize it's a bug

1247
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,140
and it's not something yeah they're

1248
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:45,960
personally using in those cases it's

1249
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,240
probably best for me like personally

1250
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,100
what I do is I don't there are personal

1251
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,480
get up accounts with the employees I can

1252
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,980
to look but we are I also tend to find

1253
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:00,090
specific employees github accounts that

1254
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:01,980
are registered with the company so I

1255
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,870
think I tweeted this in the past is if

1256
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:07,350
you look up company - and then asterisk

1257
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:09,180
and look for all the users those usually

1258
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,610
are getup accounts for employees working

1259
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:13,500
at that company and what I tend to do is

1260
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,540
from there I decide to do similar things

1261
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:16,980
that all the other hackers do is

1262
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:19,200
download the github repos and then use

1263
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,750
get robbed or other tools to find for

1264
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:24,140
info informations on the repo files and

1265
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:26,580
usually if you find it open there try to

1266
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,950
validate it so you might want to see

1267
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:30,150
like if the information is actually

1268
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:32,880
accurate even if it's all like some of

1269
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,130
those tokens could have been committed

1270
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:36,960
like two years ago but they could still

1271
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,200
be valid so one classic examples France

1272
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,360
has done this mentioned it has mentioned

1273
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,690
this in the past is to slack API tokens

1274
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:46,620
someone will put it out on get up

1275
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:48,150
they'll delete it but they'll forget to

1276
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:49,980
rotate it so you'll just be able to use

1277
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:52,770
that token to actually read messages and

1278
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:54,990
read other informations out there so if

1279
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:56,640
you do get a token and you want to test

1280
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,990
it up but you don't know how to do it

1281
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:00,780
there's a really good rep oh by streak

1282
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,880
G hacks that has bunch of links that you

1283
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,550
can utilize for a specific third party

1284
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:07,140
so if you have a slack token just plug

1285
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:08,580
it in there see what permissions you

1286
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:10,560
have obviously if you get it as invalid

1287
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:11,910
permission or something that means the

1288
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:13,740
token was removed so at that point

1289
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,420
unless there's anything else on the

1290
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,160
document or on the repo I don't think

1291
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,740
it'll be worth reporting it but if you

1292
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:20,970
have other tokens that are actually

1293
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:22,560
valid see what else you can get out of

1294
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,050
it and thus in regards to that I kind of

1295
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:26,940
want to give out a upcoming feature

1296
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:30,510
really it's kind of thing is in about

1297
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:32,550
three months I'm realizing a feature

1298
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:34,650
close to key hacks it is going to be

1299
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:36,570
automated script where you can just plug

1300
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:38,610
in tokens and it will do a full exploit

1301
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:40,020
for it so if you were to give it a slack

1302
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,090
token and if you choose aggressive mode

1303
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:43,980
it will dump you all the messages for

1304
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,690
each channel that the token can access

1305
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:49,650
so we're trying to utilize key hacks for

1306
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:51,660
that so you will see the script come out

1307
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:54,330
within three months I'll say at the end

1308
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:59,280
of December yeah random Ravi has a

1309
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,900
really good up yeah I think he also has

1310
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,310
red X for things you can look for

1311
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:04,500
directly and get our bure pose which I

1312
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,670
have utilized in the past I don't know

1313
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:07,050
if it's random Robbie or someone else

1314
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:09,500
would disclose that

1315
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,560
you

1316
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:17,170
just got a good question from paper-bag

1317
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:20,470
Prince asked or you know that first they

1318
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:22,570
made a conservation that it seems like

1319
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:25,240
chaining bugs together is what gets you

1320
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,340
the big bug bounties are this thick

1321
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:30,340
bounties so are there any bug chains

1322
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,500
that you find yourself chaining together

1323
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,720
over and over and your bug bounty

1324
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,310
hunting

1325
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:37,450
there are while so there's multiple

1326
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:39,370
chains you can do so like if it's web

1327
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:42,070
security there's XSS two CSRF to account

1328
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:44,350
takeovers and all of those attacks you

1329
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:46,570
can do one thing that has happened to me

1330
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:49,630
a lot recently and I even wrote about

1331
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:52,240
this is following up on ticket trick

1332
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,120
that inti looked at is when inti

1333
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,640
disclosed about the blog or the exploit

1334
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,860
you could just go to company's domain

1335
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:02,110
and then you go to the ticket trick and

1336
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:03,400
you could get into their slack and other

1337
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,010
stuff but slack decided to secure that

1338
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:08,260
so there was no like ways to exploit it

1339
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,860
and when I started looking to deeper

1340
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:13,330
ticket trick will still work on a lot of

1341
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:15,400
companies but I wanted to see how I

1342
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,830
could chain that to other places and we

1343
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:19,720
use Google logins so we verified the

1344
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,550
email on Google and then log into every

1345
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:23,320
internal places we could from that and

1346
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,240
got access to a lot of sensitive info

1347
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,910
that has worked for me a lot in life

1348
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:30,940
hacking events and other events and it

1349
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:33,310
still works so it doesn't necessarily it

1350
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:35,440
hasn't necessarily been fixed by any

1351
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,730
companies I will say there are still

1352
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:39,340
ways to attack it it's just to chain

1353
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:41,560
them you have to know what your next

1354
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:44,470
chain will be once you start looking at

1355
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:45,820
it further like once you start looking

1356
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:48,190
at ticket trick and then start testing

1357
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:49,900
how it works I think you will have an

1358
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,700
idea of like how to chain them so that's

1359
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,100
one of the biggest attack vectors that

1360
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,810
have seen myself doing a lot of chaining

1361
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:57,580
over and over right now because there's

1362
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:59,380
a lot of different ways you could if

1363
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:01,150
like one door closes there's another

1364
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:02,770
door always open and ticket trick to

1365
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:05,140
actually get into internal panels with

1366
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:10,780
those there was a question about what is

1367
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:12,130
the most critical thing you found

1368
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:15,640
through the msconfig in G suite so there

1369
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:19,180
were a couple of them one of them in

1370
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:20,620
terms of Google Calendar one of the most

1371
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:22,570
critical was getting that credentials

1372
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:24,100
that allowed us all the videos for

1373
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,809
internal interviews

1374
00:51:25,809 --> 00:51:28,749
we also had for Google Docs we had

1375
00:51:28,749 --> 00:51:30,999
downloaded product or we have got access

1376
00:51:30,999 --> 00:51:32,559
to all as I said upcoming product

1377
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:36,219
features until 2021 or 2024 companies so

1378
00:51:36,219 --> 00:51:38,109
not a critical but like a high

1379
00:51:38,109 --> 00:51:40,599
information disclosure for them we also

1380
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:44,229
had for a company we were able to

1381
00:51:44,229 --> 00:51:45,969
download their unreleased tools and

1382
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:48,819
unreleased features so this is a company

1383
00:51:48,819 --> 00:51:50,109
that builds softwares and other things

1384
00:51:50,109 --> 00:51:51,819
and we could actually download their

1385
00:51:51,819 --> 00:51:53,259
upcoming features that's not even known

1386
00:51:53,259 --> 00:51:55,809
to the public yet and the kind of a good

1387
00:51:55,809 --> 00:51:57,400
part on that is when we escalated it

1388
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,289
further the internal software's that we

1389
00:51:59,289 --> 00:52:02,410
had actually allowed to find internal

1390
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,329
domains and they had like test usernames

1391
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,650
and passwords for those so we could log

1392
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:07,930
into those as well so those have been on

1393
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:12,430
other critical findings we had someone

1394
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:14,829
asked what are public sources to find

1395
00:52:14,829 --> 00:52:17,289
sensitive so there's a lot of sources

1396
00:52:17,289 --> 00:52:19,059
out there that have sensitive data

1397
00:52:19,059 --> 00:52:21,279
Trello is one of the biggest ones right

1398
00:52:21,279 --> 00:52:23,229
now we have we have found a lot of those

1399
00:52:23,229 --> 00:52:25,420
I keep forgetting the hackers name but

1400
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:27,640
he found a lot of those and he has

1401
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,380
discloses in the past I think upon one

1402
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,880
on the United Nations and other

1403
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,150
companies as well basement is a pretty

1404
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:36,729
useful one it's not as useful now I

1405
00:52:36,729 --> 00:52:39,249
think is if you find it is probably some

1406
00:52:39,249 --> 00:52:40,660
other hacker testing and putting

1407
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:43,719
information there as notes but we have

1408
00:52:43,719 --> 00:52:45,999
found stuff on like the happily the

1409
00:52:45,999 --> 00:52:48,039
bookmark which that I mentioned there

1410
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:50,679
are also slideshare.net where companies

1411
00:52:50,679 --> 00:52:52,539
tend to put their internal slides there

1412
00:52:52,539 --> 00:52:54,729
and not realize it's public so you can

1413
00:52:54,729 --> 00:52:56,559
not always like a security issue but you

1414
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,539
can find internal info that you can use

1415
00:52:58,539 --> 00:53:01,239
so let's say a classic example is let's

1416
00:53:01,239 --> 00:53:02,529
say if you find it necessary app and you

1417
00:53:02,529 --> 00:53:04,749
don't know internal domains to hit you

1418
00:53:04,749 --> 00:53:06,369
can probably find slides that mints and

1419
00:53:06,369 --> 00:53:09,160
internal domains into strago's get but

1420
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,859
github is a perfect one asana is even

1421
00:53:11,859 --> 00:53:13,630
better I really like asana I'm not gonna

1422
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:14,979
like we have found a lot of this stuff

1423
00:53:14,979 --> 00:53:17,709
with that JIRA's are good you

1424
00:53:17,709 --> 00:53:19,900
specifically look at the cloud or class

1425
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:22,569
Ian instances for companies and see if

1426
00:53:22,569 --> 00:53:25,449
they allow public sign up if it's like

1427
00:53:25,449 --> 00:53:28,209
let's say bakra docked on CNN and if you

1428
00:53:28,209 --> 00:53:29,499
can't go there and so see all the

1429
00:53:29,499 --> 00:53:31,809
tickets there it's already bad so you

1430
00:53:31,809 --> 00:53:33,189
probably want to check those out as well

1431
00:53:33,189 --> 00:53:34,959
obviously internal jiriz are even useful

1432
00:53:34,959 --> 00:53:36,939
because those tend to have more security

1433
00:53:36,939 --> 00:53:39,009
issues I think that the cloud version of

1434
00:53:39,009 --> 00:53:39,610
it

1435
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:42,730
um bitbucket is another good github is

1436
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:44,590
always useful there's always a lot of

1437
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:46,240
things can get up to cover

1438
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:50,140
there's also another slide sharing

1439
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:51,970
website called Prezi which allows you to

1440
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:54,190
do animated slides and we have found

1441
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:56,410
internal documentation some new features

1442
00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:59,050
internal even tickets info for support

1443
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:00,400
tickets so employees will be doing a

1444
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,350
Google Docs or like you'll be doing

1445
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:06,310
presentation on internal support issues

1446
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:08,230
they got and those will be made public

1447
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:11,670
so that's really good for escalating it

1448
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:18,160
I don't know what do you mean by GSI

1449
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:22,480
issues and what do you mean by open sup

1450
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:27,850
fiha API so I'm not actually sure wolf

1451
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:29,770
droid what do you what do you want me to

1452
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:32,080
spell out I can probably type it in the

1453
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,790
message easily easier which will

1454
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:38,740
probably easier for everyone in that

1455
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:40,420
case there's also another one that was

1456
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,340
asked to me is can you talk about some

1457
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:44,530
crazy bug that you recently found so

1458
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:48,700
this one is a really good thing I was

1459
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:52,240
doing some kind of recon on a company

1460
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:56,050
and there was a domain that allows

1461
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:59,620
signing up as referrals slash partners

1462
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:02,020
kind of thing so one signed up you call

1463
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:03,820
actually like it will take time to get

1464
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:05,230
verified so they all verify your account

1465
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:07,390
and they'll add it to internal referral

1466
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:10,240
instance but the interesting part of

1467
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,950
that is their internal instance had no

1468
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:14,230
access controls so instead of just being

1469
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:16,540
a partner I could be an admin and it

1470
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:18,310
actually allowed me to get list of all

1471
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:20,620
their customers monitor their customers

1472
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:23,470
in real life so whatever like for

1473
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:25,540
example if the customer was paying 100k

1474
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:27,910
for their services I could see when they

1475
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:29,800
had paid that when the next due date is

1476
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,230
what they're billing details is and all

1477
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:34,450
of those sensitive info so it's always

1478
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:36,130
those recon things that you don't think

1479
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:37,660
it'll work and it ends up working that

1480
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:41,680
are pretty critical I've also had not

1481
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:44,350
recently but in not in bug bounties when

1482
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:46,720
I was working there was a company's

1483
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,860
website that allowed you to create

1484
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:49,870
badges so I could discreet there was a

1485
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:52,090
API requests to create badge for the

1486
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:54,640
building and you'll just send a request

1487
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,290
put your name and your picture and it

1488
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:58,510
will create a batch for you with RFID on

1489
00:55:58,510 --> 00:55:59,860
there and you could just go to the

1490
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,450
office scan it and you could get access

1491
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:03,550
to the building so there have been like

1492
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:05,050
pretty fun things that you can know that

1493
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:06,820
I've found with different recon

1494
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:11,290
strategies on them I think that answered

1495
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:14,700
pretty much all

1496
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:18,299
yeah he was asking about Prezi I think

1497
00:56:18,299 --> 00:56:21,630
it was which is PR easy I I believe yeah

1498
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:24,180
yeah that's what wolf joyed was asking

1499
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:26,640
to spell earlier okay yeah that's that's

1500
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,170
a really good words that I have used in

1501
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:30,240

1509
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,170

LinkedIn I don't use it a lot so

1518
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:14,099
