00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:20,899
but today I will be only sharing my own

26
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:23,990
personal views of my prior research

27
00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:26,210
which by the way are not legal advice so

28
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:28,939
if you ever seen my talks you know I

29
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:31,100
have this usual disclaimer very excited

30
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:34,189
to be here today two years ago I started

31
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:36,949
working on issues around legal aspects

32
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:38,719
of bug bounties and safe harbor and

33
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,880
worked closely with background and

34
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,469
standardization of the language of bug

35
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,469
bounties and fallibility disclosure

36
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:47,509
programs on a project called disclosed

37
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:50,298
i/o which you're gonna hear about today

38
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:55,329
so honored to be here with the stinked

39
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:55,329

40
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,568
sure good morning afternoon and evening

41
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,939
everyone my name is Chris Johnson I am

42
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:07,609
the director of the department defense

43
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:09,410
vulnerability disclosure program I am

44
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:11,510
NOT an attorney as well so I will not be

45
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:15,379
giving a legal advice I'm just a

46
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:17,030
professional geek I come from a small

47
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:19,579
town in New York called Jamestown New

48
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,120
York home of a Lucille Ball so that's a

49
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,220
that's always

50
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,159
Plus that we can always laugh at that I

51
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:27,980
spent my first six years in the Air

52
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:29,649

airborne warning and control system

54
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,840
spent a lot of time deployed overseas

55
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:37,609
defending other nations in our own

56
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,200
afterwards I spent 14 years really

57
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:42,500

69
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:23,840
here and to talk to you guys about about

70
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:25,609
the DoD in our program sure my name is

71
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,849
John or PC I live in the great state of

72

mission lead on the VDP program working

75
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:43,480
with Chris to work these bug bounties

76
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:47,060
and and vulnerability

77
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:51,560
stop pardon me sorry I've got something

78
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:53,359
going on in the other room so uh my

79
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,680
background is I've worked with I guess

80
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:57,079
had been blocking for about 18 years now

81
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,870
working a variety of different tasking

82
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:01,910
and cybersecurity and integration

83
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,290
between strategic man tactical battle

84
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:07,190
command and things like that supporting

85
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:09,349
the US Army and before that my

86
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:11,239
background and education is mostly in

87
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:19,190
Applied Physics so interesting jump from

88
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:21,019
that to what I'm currently doing and

89
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,108
there are secure researchers are very

90
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:25,229
excited

91
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:27,330
this panel if any of you guys don't know

92
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:29,849
a name is Chloe Misaki I work for but

93
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:34,770
crowd I on the research for groom team

94
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:37,289
with Sam and Haddix and I'm thrilled

95
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:39,688
right now so let's first dive in here

96
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:43,199
tell us a little bit Chris and John

97
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:45,419
about the dod like what are you guys and

98
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,479
what is your connection to bug bounties

99
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:50,520
and vulnerability disclosures yeah

100
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,590
that's a great question thank you I so

101
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,650
the DoD obviously is an organization

102
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:57,840
that's been around for quite a while the

103
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:00,090
the I would say the mission statement

104
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,150
for the DoD is we provide military

105
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:06,628
forces to deter war and ensure our

106
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:08,878
nation's security both home and abroad I

107
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:11,729
think it's important to understand

108
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:15,629
really the the size scope and scale of

109
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:17,219
the DoD so you can you can start to kind

110
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:20,520
of change your mind and your in your

111
00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:22,620
mindset towards how large our TAC

112
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:28,049
surface really is so when you look at

113
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:30,599
the DoD we are about 2.8 million users

114
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:35,190
that's active duty military personnel

115
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:37,378
and DoD civilians is myself we operate

116
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:40,529
across all seven continents a hundred

117
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:42,180
and sixty countries 4800 sites so that's

118
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:43,560
huge when we really put that in

119
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,629
perspective just realize that we're

120
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,979
actually America's largest employer

121
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:50,219
we're larger than wal-mart and

122
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:51,360
McDonald's so that's a significant

123
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:54,000
obviously we talk about you know the

124
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,089
social engineering aspects of that how

125
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,879
the DoD looks at at each area of their

126
00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:02,099
attack surface and and truly some of the

127
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:04,800
initiatives that we have so when we

128
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:06,599
think about the question you know what

129
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,419
is DoD and what's our connection to bug

130
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:13,800
Bonnie so bug Bonnie's are definitely a

131
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:17,099
key portion of the DoD's our initiative

132
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,770
towards trying to get after the

133
00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:22,610
vulnerabilities in our systems most of

134
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:26,698
them obviously being the external facing

135
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:28,319
within within my program we're really

136
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:30,750
focused on the vulnerability disclosure

137
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,419
so but we're a little different than the

138
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:35,879
bug bounties most of them are

139
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:40,438
tremendously successful I ran by

140
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:42,389
the digital defense service TDS I know

141
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:44,550
they've we've they've done hack the hack

142
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:47,639
the anything hack the airforce hack the

143
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,050
Marines the army the Pentagon they're in

144
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,490
like the third version they just

145
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,349
finished up hacked the Air Force and

146
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:55,020
they'll continue doing that they have a

147
00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:57,179
lot of they have a lot of events

148
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,369
scheduled so we're we're different

149
00:06:57,179 --> 00:07:03,179
though is that you know that's a ace a

150
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:05,729
limited one to four week event that that

151
00:07:03,179 --> 00:07:07,109
they have a very targeted frame they

152
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:11,729
have very specific systems that they

153
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:14,789
want to that they want to scan pen test

154
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:18,990
and and eventually secured we are them

155
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:22,740
more enduring program so we run 365 days

156
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:25,559
a year 24/7 so it's a when you think

157
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:27,509
about what we're looking at it's not the

158
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:32,189
targeted it's more of the

159
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:33,509
all-encompassing across the DoD so you

160
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:34,740
know the deal the attack surface

161
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:36,839
you know once again we talk about the

162
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,119
people but you know also understand that

163
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:42,809
the the DoD's attack surfaces we're

164
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:45,209
talking 15,000 networks and over seven

165
00:07:42,809 --> 00:07:46,949
million devices I'm it's incredible to

166
00:07:45,209 --> 00:07:48,869
put that into perspective and the amount

167
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:50,639
of risk that's out there so we

168
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:52,409
internally we can't do it on our own

169
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,779
when we have uh some fantastic folks

170
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:56,789
that work around the clock to secure it

171
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:59,159
but from both the inside and outside but

172
00:07:56,789 --> 00:08:00,389
we need to have the relationship right

173
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:02,459
we have to have the relationship outside

174
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:04,159
with the researcher community and that's

175
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:07,860
where the vulnerability disclosure

176
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:09,899
program or VDP comes into place so this

177
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,689
was actually started in 2016 by the

178
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:15,990
Secretary of Defense ash Carter the true

179
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:17,909
goal was to really follow private

180
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:20,009
industries move to develop a

181
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:23,009
relationship with the global white hat

182
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:25,289
community and and at the end of the day

183
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:28,949
they want to harness that amazing power

184
00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:30,719
of crowdsourcing as and we will talk

185
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:32,699
about this obviously more in the next

186
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:36,240
hour but it's been truly it's been a

187
00:08:32,698 --> 00:08:39,598
very successful program so far and we

188
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:43,620
look at expanding you know what what we

189
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:46,200
do and ultimately the value to the US

190
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,600
taxpayer

191
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:52,410
and it's totally segues into my next

192
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:55,310
question which is like how do you how do

193
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:57,630
you handle of Honor ability submissions

194
00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:01,619
yeah no that that's another great

195
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:03,600
question so we have have established a

196
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,910
an approved policy signed by the

197
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,850
Secretary of Defense and all of the

198
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:10,740
different components we have a website

199
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:13,680
that they can go to

200
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:16,380
it's a hacker one forward slash

201
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,229
Department of Defense and and they

202
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,850
basically you can go on sign up and if

203
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:23,670
you see something you can report it

204
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,890
within the the confines of the policies

205
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:27,870
the policy is right there we're very

206
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:30,270
much open and honest we're very

207
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:32,580
transparent because we want to ensure

208
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,410
that the folks that that that are out

209
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:38,970
there then they're looking at at what we

210
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:41,219
have available to to to analyze and to

211
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:43,740
research and to report on I want to make

212
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,150
sure they're very comfortable with the

213
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,600
left and right boundaries of what we

214
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:51,990
have once again we're the first in the

215
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:57,150
federal government to have a open policy

216
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:59,220
like that to to get those crowd-sourced

217
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:00,630
vulnerability submissions and I think

218
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,040
that's really important that we're not

219
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:05,160
just doing it on our own that it's the

220
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:07,260
it's the the community so that is it's

221
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,329
probably the easiest way to do it you

222
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:12,600
can obviously you can go to to our

223
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:14,370
website on dc3 mill that will link you

224
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,140
to all that stuff we started a Twitter

225
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,460
page so all of these and we have an

226
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,110
email address on there too so we have

227
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:21,390
many different ways that you can reach

228
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:23,250
into and ask questions and communicate

229
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:25,530
with the team because ultimately we're

230
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:35,880
all after the same thing right to defend

231
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:37,709
the DoD's networks usually take and how

232
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:43,020
does it work internally when taking any

233
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:45,990
sort of actions sure so oftentimes like

234
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:49,199
you know when a researchers submit team

235
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:51,180
team at the office we we worked through

236
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,420
those pretty quickly so like the initial

237
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:56,750
triage within a few hours to maybe 24

238
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,250
hours depending on the complexity of the

239
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,939
validation we do have to validate these

240
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:05,639
reports

241
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:08,819
received them after that because the the

242
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:10,679
size and complexity of DoD the actual

243
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:13,319
turnaround time for fix or revalidation

244
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:16,879
of that fix could take anywhere between

245
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:23,449
a few weeks to a few months depending on

246
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:36,779
scale size and what is actually being

247
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:38,639
affected by this vulnerability yeah so

248
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:40,109
once again I would talk about the

249
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,839
successes and I'm really I'm really

250
00:11:40,109 --> 00:11:44,309
proud to share what we've been able to

251
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:47,129
do in the 26 months

252
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:49,618
that we started understanding that that

253
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:54,299
really when this thing kicked off on the

254
00:11:49,619 --> 00:11:57,899
the 21st of October of 2016 we're only

255
00:11:54,299 --> 00:12:00,869
given 30 days to start it so that from

256
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:03,209
anyone that's ever started anything is a

257
00:12:00,869 --> 00:12:04,470
pretty big monumental shift because

258
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:06,508
there's a lot of obviously because of

259
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:09,119
the complexity and the size of the DoD

260
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:11,039
there's a lot of moving parts some cogs

261
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:12,869
and things that we have to take into

262
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:16,109
consideration like the resourcing and

263
00:12:12,869 --> 00:12:17,849
the structure so we're a or a process

264
00:12:16,109 --> 00:12:19,679
and a policy driven organization so

265
00:12:17,849 --> 00:12:21,479
though the policy started so when we

266
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,189
talk about when we first started so as

267
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:24,209
of yesterday when I when I pulled the

268
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:25,978
latest statistics

269
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:28,258
we're actually add over 8,600

270
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:30,959
vulnerabilities submitted since since

271
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:34,229
since November which is is pretty

272
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:37,888
phenomenal considering we haven't spent

273
00:12:34,229 --> 00:12:40,470
a dollar really as far as on the on the

274
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:43,949
on the bounty side right so people can

275
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:45,929
come in and and we are kind of the we

276
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:48,748
call the a breeding or a training ground

277
00:12:45,929 --> 00:12:51,629
for folks to to come in to hone their

278
00:12:48,749 --> 00:12:54,959
skills and to take that next level right

279
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:56,419
to a paid bug bounty program so out of

280
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,579
eighty six hundred vulnerabilities

281
00:12:56,419 --> 00:13:01,079
really when we look at it about 69

282
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:04,019
percent of those vulnerabilities are

283
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:05,848
actionable meaning that they are are

284
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:09,539
truly legitimate there's something that

285
00:13:05,849 --> 00:13:12,869
that my team has verified we've worked

286
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:13,709
with the researcher and the system owner

287
00:13:12,869 --> 00:13:17,509
to

288
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:20,309
to verify the the severity of it so

289
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:23,459
internal to that 69% cuz I'm all about I

290
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:24,660
like quantifiable data right so and most

291
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:26,729
of the folks I'm guessing on the line

292
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,410
really want to know numbers so out of

293
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:31,499
those out of that sixty nine percent

294
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:34,379
that are actionable we're looking at

295
00:13:31,499 --> 00:13:36,689
around thirteen percent that are

296
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:39,449
actually what we consider significant

297
00:13:36,689 --> 00:13:41,879
that's a a medium a high or a critical

298
00:13:39,449 --> 00:13:44,490
vulnerability now there are many ways to

299
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:46,439
differentiate between a medium and

300
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,300
critical and high the criticals

301
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:50,790
obviously are the absolute worst it's an

302
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:53,579
open door people can come in and they

303
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:57,059
can they can manipulate the system they

304
00:13:53,579 --> 00:14:00,388
can do some severe damage to both the

305
00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:03,809
data on it and potentially you know our

306
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:05,579
national security so so we've we found

307
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:07,139
about seventy-eight criticals and that

308
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:10,229
about twenty six months seventy-eight

309
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:12,929
that were an open door so very glad to

310
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:15,179
obviously to close those fantastic that

311
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:18,800
the the the researchers are working hard

312
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:21,269
with us two hundred and ten of those

313
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,508
vulnerabilities there are considered

314
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:26,850
high which means that they can they can

315
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:29,730
certainly walk in the door but they

316
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:31,800
couldn't really jump through and do

317
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,939
lateral movements across the system so

318
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,649
they could get in an exploit but

319
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:36,120
certainly it could they could turn into

320
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:38,370
critical and then about eight hundred

321
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,050
eighteen mediums which is a little bit

322
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:41,970
less than than a high means the doors

323
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:45,719
slightly open takes a little bit more

324
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:48,839
work to get in there and and and like I

325
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,129
said you know 13% significant fifty-six

326
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:52,920
percent of that sixty nine percent is

327
00:14:50,129 --> 00:15:05,790
actually or what we consider low so

328
00:14:52,920 --> 00:15:06,870
those are oh we have a power outage it's

329
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:09,299
gonna make for a really interesting

330
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:12,480
things a jumping jacks in the back but

331
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:13,949
thanks so fifty six percent of all the

332
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,249
vulnerabilities that we've had we

333
00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:20,189
consider a low which are they are miss

334
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:24,509
configuration something that you know

335
00:15:20,189 --> 00:15:26,459
may not may not be truly critical to the

336
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:27,330
system or the data that sits within it

337
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,430
and behind it

338
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,779
but certainly their actual something

339
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:34,050
that we take forward and we moved it

340
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:36,149
system owner overall 31% of the

341
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:41,459
vulnerabilities that we get we consider

342
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:43,320
as as as informational duplicates out of

343
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:44,969
scope and we'll talk about that a little

344
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,700
bit but just know that you know

345
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:50,910
currently our policy is designed to to

346
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:53,970
only look at the forward facing DoD

347
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:57,089
websites so when it comes to things like

348
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:59,820
blue coats and firewalls and load

349
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:01,080
balancers and traffic shapers any of

350
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,209
those things are kind of out of scope

351
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,740
right now for our policy and then of

352
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:07,529
course spam we get very little spam

353
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:09,180
because we do a tremendous job

354
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:11,370
communicating with the researchers and

355
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:13,140
with our policy that's out there for

356
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,120
everyone to see they know those left and

357
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:17,520
right boundaries so they know okay I'm

358
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,350
not going to submit spam I will tell you

359
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,180
another another great thing that's come

360
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:24,029
out we've actually received through our

361
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:26,250
channels around five zero day

362
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:29,100
vulnerabilities so these were unknown

363
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:30,990
prior to coming to our door and that's

364
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:34,170
fantastic and we obviously take those in

365
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:36,660
and process them with the system owners

366
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:39,060
help and and then we coordinate with the

367
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:41,069
proper agencies to get those highlighted

368
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,119
so you know when you look at likes it

369
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:45,990
out of eighty six hundred phone

370
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:47,820
abilities almost 70% of those are true

371
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:49,740
vulnerabilities are able to be action

372
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:53,070
which is a pretty significant number

373
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:55,800
when you think about the amount of

374
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:57,209
reporting and also how many of those

375
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,790
holes right how many of those holes

376
00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:03,510
actually were actually mitigated and

377
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:05,399
patched it's it's it's really kind of

378
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:07,379
brought to the forefront hey these are

379
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,110
things these are things that we haven't

380
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:12,059
gotten after before things that the

381
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:15,089
automated systems are missing that

382
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:16,589
people are missing and and that the red

383
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:18,240
teams that go out there that are

384
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:20,909
actually going and doing the penetration

385
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,800
test even they miss them so we truly

386
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:25,829
fill in that that special gap in the

387
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,659
middle which is which is harnessing the

388
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:30,120
power of crowdsourcing which I don't

389
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:33,590
think that you know I don't think that

390
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,590
it should be understated

391
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:38,590
the Khurana this helps so much for you

392
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:42,190
guys and the numbers I'm hearing since

393
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:45,310
2016 is absolutely fantastic and I'd

394
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:48,760
love to hear about this I mean I

395
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:51,520
remember your first time I met you you

396
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,740
were giving a talk about basically you

397
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:58,840
got like this yeah

398
00:17:53,740 --> 00:18:00,670
extortion also but safe harbor I just

399
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,580
have to ask like tell us a little bit

400
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:05,200
about you know safe harbor how did it

401
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,290
get so passionate about it I know this

402
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,020
was your research this is like your baby

403
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:13,420
when you were easy Berkeley

404
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:14,920
happy to get involved yeah and it's

405
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,540
important to recognize also that the

406
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:20,100
Center for long-term cyber security at

407
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:23,620
UC Berkeley funded this research as well

408
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:25,360
so the true story is I come from in

409
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,729
terms of use and intellectual property

410
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:31,000
background my whole dissertation is

411
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:33,220
around contracts and for my sister Karen

412
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,050
Irizarry you have brilliant

413
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,610
talk about hackers as their immune

414
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:38,590
system of the internet you should check

415
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:40,120
it out she's right here of course in

416
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:44,439
Israel listening to me right now

417
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:46,419
I came exposed to bug bounties and I

418
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,350
need a best project for course for

419
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,270
crystal

420
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:51,070
I decided to take the first look into

421
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:52,990
the contracts of bug bounties and

422
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,970
vulnerability disclosure programs at the

423
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:57,550
time it was literally you know one of

424
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:59,680
the first research project into this

425
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:04,300
landscape I discovered an interesting

426
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:06,790
thing although the hunting hacking

427
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:09,129
landscape in the United States and in

428
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:10,480
general really relies on this notion of

429
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:12,880
theorization you have to have a

430
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,760
cessation that's the system if you

431
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,330
exceed our ization if you do something

432
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,010
you circumvent measures that protect the

433
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:23,020
software is copyrighted are protected

434
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:25,900
code beyond the thighs asian without

435
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:29,139
consent that in certain circumstances

436
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:31,060
you might find yourself in criminal and

437
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:33,130
civil liability we're gonna talk about

438
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:35,590
that a little bit more if we have time

439
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:38,530
but the point is although this whole

440
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:41,080
kind of complex legal regime is big but

441
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:43,149
relies on authorization when I took a

442
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,889
look at the bug bounty and you know well

443
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:46,460
nobody to disclose your program terms I

444
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:48,410
found that the legal

445
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,900
part of the programs as opposed to the

446
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:53,060
technical part wasn't as fleshed out

447
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,920
wasn't wasn't outlined there were some

448
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:58,280
paradoxical terms that might put

449
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:01,940
researchers at risk so I'm talking about

450
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:05,750
this is almost three years ago who

451
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:08,300
basically inspired by Karen I decided to

452
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:10,130
to not just write the paper the paper is

453
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,450
out there and you can check it out it's

454
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:14,720
already it's accessible to all

455
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:16,760
unnecessary end but also to try to

456
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,430
basically effect change

457
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:22,370
just some real impact and I went to

458
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:24,560
DEFCON then I went to b-sides and I you

459
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:26,270
know I used I threw Karen in for

460
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,010
connections and through Twitter I said

461
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:29,960
you know Sam you gotta be in my talk and

462
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,950
how come on you gotta be in my talk

463
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,070
because I have something really

464
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:36,380
important to tell you and you know this

465
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:38,480
is 2017 you know I'm starting to do work

466
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:41,210
on this since then I've done around 14

467
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,400
conferences and I worked with closely

468
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:45,800
the platforms and backgrounds you did an

469
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,110
amazing work with this crows i/o and the

470
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,990
idea was we need a standard for the

471
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:55,520
legalese for the landscape that really

472
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:57,260
is is geared towards getting the

473
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,389
authorization getting those legal

474
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:01,070
protections for the researchers because

475
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:03,140
that's what you would usually find in a

476
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:05,210
pen test contract because these are

477
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:08,000
ticketed lipid contracts we sometimes we

478
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:10,610
don't see them in bug bounty terms but

479
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,410
the idea is like open source licenses we

480
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:14,689
can create one standard that will also

481
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:16,730
benefit the corporation and the

482
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:19,760
researcher so that's the safe harder

483
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:23,840
safe harbor initiative research that

484
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:26,660
I've done as part of UC Berkeley and I'm

485
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,970
proud to say that it's now it's evolved

486
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:32,030
I was able to work with Tesla and with

487
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:33,620
background tackle one with Dropbox were

488
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:36,080
the first kind of to take the lead in

489
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:38,629
this in this landscape and change their

490
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,780
policy to introduce safe harbors to

491
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:44,090
introduce protections so when Chris

492
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:46,220
mentions the bug bounty policy or the

493
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:47,360
vivan ability disclosure program policy

494
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:51,020
and it's supposed to distinguish between

495
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:55,429
them my focus was the legal part because

496
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:57,770
I recognized that we do have important

497
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:59,540
rules and important laws are at place

498
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,360
that are you know geared towards

499
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,240
protecting

500
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,799
interests but they might cause

501
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,620
uncertainty and they all focused on this

502
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,960
notion of theorization so that in a

503
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:11,279
nutshell day initiative that it's it's

504
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,830
been going for a while and it's been

505
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:15,510
developing very nicely and I'm very

506
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:30,750
thankful for background involvement in

507
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:33,929
this landscape and I'm curious now how

508
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:35,760
is DoD protecting and its sites

509
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:40,080
when it comes to their policy on safe

510
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:41,879
harbor II so I guess I'll take that I'm

511
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:46,110
like once again not a lawyer so please

512
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:48,779
don't bring me up for it but I will say

513
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:50,939
that if you look at where we've been

514
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:54,149
over the 26 months that we've started

515
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:55,799
VDP we have we out of the eighty six

516
00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:59,010
hundred reports that we've processed

517
00:22:55,799 --> 00:23:01,710
we've had zero incidents right so I want

518
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:04,620
to highlight that as me talked about you

519
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:07,080
know it's important to have that sound

520
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,789
policy so your researchers know they're

521
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,850
left and right boundaries in how they

522
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:14,250
report so I think that the wording the

523
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:16,529
wording all the lawyers were involved it

524
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:18,600
is not a very we don't have a lot of

525
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:20,429
legal jargon and the policy if you read

526
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,100
it's very clear what you can and can't

527
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:26,519
submit that is important that's

528
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:27,899
important because having zero issues is

529
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:29,730
something and I think that's a win

530
00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:31,768
that's just a success in something the

531
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,510
highlight the only problem that we

532
00:23:31,769 --> 00:23:35,340
actually had over these twenty six

533
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:37,980
months is we had a researcher that was

534
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,269
actually trying to social engineer us so

535
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,700
that was one of our researchers that

536
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:44,639
tried to get out of something but as far

537
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,440
as the the reportable stuff things that

538
00:23:44,639 --> 00:23:48,600
that that the Department of Justice

539
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,750
would ever be involved in we're at zero

540
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,219
if there were an issue right when we'll

541
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:55,380
just we'll play you know we'll play

542
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:58,289
devil's advocate and say that the the

543
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:01,950
researcher was absolutely within the

544
00:23:58,289 --> 00:24:03,629
lines of our policy and they were doing

545
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:06,690
exactly what they said they were going

546
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:09,029
to do to keep our network safe if there

547
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:10,440
was ever a problem that's where we come

548
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:12,270
over the top and we communicate with

549
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,240
Department of Justice and ensure that

550
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:17,840
they know that this Reacher this

551
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:20,570
researcher was operating within a DoD

552
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:23,780
established program so that means that

553
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:26,300
we kind of we you know our our goal is

554
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:28,850
to negotiate that and to keep them away

555
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:31,428
from what could be considered any type

556
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:33,439
of of movement for the department

557
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:34,429
justice once again we've had no problems

558
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,080
26 months

559
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:38,720
I don't expect there to be problems and

560
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,669
and the DOJ is they've actually bought

561
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,750
off on this policy so they are very well

562
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:43,970
aware of that

563
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:46,910
so it's been a it's been on all sides

564
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:48,800
both within the department within the

565
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:51,260
department justice and then within the

566
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:53,720
community very transparent everyone

567
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:57,470
knows how we operate and and it's

568
00:24:53,720 --> 00:25:00,500
resulted in no problems okay since you

569
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:03,890
do bring up like a bus submitting modern

570
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:07,510
buildings and like language and how to

571
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:09,740
go about it what advice would you have

572
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:13,280
secure researchers when they submit

573
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:20,420
mater abilities and how the contract to

574
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:22,100
let someone go that's a good question I

575
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:24,530
want to give this one to John because

576
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,300
John out of those eighty six hundred

577
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:28,370
phone abilities he has probably touched

578
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:30,980
I don't know probably eighty six hundred

579
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:33,830
vulnerabilities he's the man so he can

580
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:35,020
tell you the the the the right way to do

581
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:39,830
it in the wrong way to do it

582
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:41,300
I'm curious sure so it's not it's no

583
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,889
long answer on this one it's like

584
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,720
basically like good communication with

585
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:46,850
us through the platform we use hacker

586
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,580
one no it's one of your competitors and

587
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:52,010
all that but bottom line is like

588
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:55,189
communicate with us through the platform

589
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:57,140
and we'll do the best we can things that

590
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:59,690
fall outside of our purview that aren't

591
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:01,790
you the assets best path to go is to go

592
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:03,559
to us cert they have their own website

593
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:08,020
and you could actually submit through

594
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:11,000
them if you found something like on us

595
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:17,240
dot gov site they can definitely take

596
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:18,890
care of that hello this is Chris I want

597
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,590
to highlight one other thing too on that

598
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:23,990
point so absolutely go through the US

599
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:27,980
sir but just know that if you submit a

600
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:31,280
vulnerability through VDP we

601
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:33,950
are are the advocates for both the

602
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,389
researcher and for the system owner so

603
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,890
we will actually take those

604
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:38,750
vulnerabilities in-house even though

605
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:40,790
it's outside of scope and we will try

606
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:44,630
our best to get that over so we've had

607
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:46,370
we've had everything from NATO website

608
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:48,260
vulnerabilities we've had things come in

609
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:50,570
for the Department of Homeland Security

610
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:52,910
you name it we've and we've seen things

611
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:55,939
out of us out of appliances as well blue

612
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:57,320
coats and and you name it so although

613
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,900
it's outside of scope we will take that

614
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,850
vulnerability typically we kind of close

615
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,770
it didn't let the researcher know hey

616
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:06,080
this is out of scope but we absolutely

617
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:07,879
take that and move it forward because as

618
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,379
a taxpayer myself I want to make sure

619
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,570
that I'm getting the most return on

620
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:13,669
investment of this program so just know

621
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:15,110
that because it's channels open that we

622
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:17,030
don't sit on things because

623
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:19,010
vulnerabilities deformability

624
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:21,799
management's only as good as how fast

625
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:23,809
you can mitigate right so okay so we

626
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:25,090
take those forward and we move them even

627
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:27,799
though they're outside of our scope

628
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:29,600
because we truly do can we're concerned

629
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:32,990
and we care about the security of the

630
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:35,030
Department of Defense websites overall

631
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:36,530
just based upon this family it really

632
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:38,690
seems like communication is definitely

633
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:41,960
one of those key elements once made bot

634
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:44,059
abilities and moving forward and I

635
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,460
really like to hear that the DoD is like

636
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:47,870
keeps up and tags with the research or

637
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:50,450
once they submit like hey this is what's

638
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:54,979
going on so keeping them updated is so

639
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:58,580
important they love that the most so I

640
00:27:54,980 --> 00:28:00,620
don't really now which is I do know like

641
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:02,299
beauty is definitely lean movements and

642
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:04,879
having better terms than the private

643
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:07,190
sector actually when it comes to

644
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,290
policies and legal protections and I'm

645
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:12,049
curious as Apollo how is that happening

646
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:22,159
and like what are you guys seeing in the

647
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:26,750
future as well so I could share a little

648
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:28,790
bit of light about it's really important

649
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:31,160
to recognize this that in fact when I

650
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:35,149
started my research look you know the

651
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:38,740
first sample DoD had the best terms so

652
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:41,779
interestingly although it was 2016

653
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:44,059
because DoD worked I

654
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:46,009
with UNS mentioned with your je and

655
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:49,639
recognize the fact that we you are now

656
00:28:46,009 --> 00:28:52,249
asking researchers to directly report

657
00:28:49,639 --> 00:28:54,320
vulnerabilities if it's under a VDP you

658
00:28:52,249 --> 00:28:56,029
know without compensation at all so

659
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,899
taking assuming a little bit of risk

660
00:28:56,029 --> 00:29:03,049
right and literally being proof of

661
00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:10,399
concept under the under the relevant

662
00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:12,710
flaws probably one establish some kind

663
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:15,439
of a legal incentive or some kind of

664
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:18,289
policy at place so at the time I'm

665
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,389
talking 2016 they already had what we

666
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:22,309
call a partial safe harbor saying that

667
00:29:20,389 --> 00:29:24,498
if you follow the careful guidelines of

668
00:29:22,309 --> 00:29:27,320
the rules so that's why I always really

669
00:29:24,499 --> 00:29:28,940
kind of really stress out for the

670
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,599
researcher community that these are not

671
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:32,570
your usual

672
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:34,908
Terms of Use which you should read but

673
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:37,070
not everybody reads I you know the

674
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:38,960
empirics is about 1% and I understand

675
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:41,029
that boundary terms you should carefully

676
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,279
read their rules about disclosure their

677
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:45,169
rules about scope this is critical and

678
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,419
it's beyond just the issues of the

679
00:29:45,169 --> 00:29:49,849
payment or or the boundaries of the

680
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:51,739
program right so they establish this

681
00:29:49,849 --> 00:29:54,349
partial safe harbor saying that if you

682
00:29:51,739 --> 00:29:56,479
follow the letter of the policy if you

683
00:29:54,349 --> 00:29:59,089
follow the guy with the guidelines we

684
00:29:56,479 --> 00:30:04,609
will not will not I recommend you for

685
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:06,889
for law enforcement right this inspired

686
00:30:04,609 --> 00:30:10,249
I think or I think to some extent the

687
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:12,678
duje framework key document it's only a

688
00:30:10,249 --> 00:30:14,599
seven page document so I recommend you

689
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:15,679
with you at least you know get some

690
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:17,499
exposure to it

691
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:21,109
in which the Department of Justice

692
00:30:17,499 --> 00:30:22,879
basically the computer law the computer

693
00:30:21,109 --> 00:30:25,158
law division outlines some of the

694
00:30:22,879 --> 00:30:28,459
considerations around bag bounties and

695
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:32,950
VDP and guess what safe harbor is right

696
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:34,729
there on page five so really really

697
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:37,249
tremendous tremendous appreciation

698
00:30:34,729 --> 00:30:40,009
towards to DoD for leading this kind of

699
00:30:37,249 --> 00:30:41,210
initiative that I assume also inspire

700
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:42,769
the DOJ framework which is a

701
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:44,330
recommendation but a really important

702
00:30:42,769 --> 00:30:47,629
document for all the lawyers and for

703
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:50,389
everybody in this field to kind of to

704
00:30:47,629 --> 00:30:52,759
kind of get exposure to because that is

705
00:30:50,389 --> 00:30:54,709
enabled to some extent what we now see

706
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:55,549
which is tremendous growth in safe

707
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:58,999
harbor and a law

708
00:30:55,549 --> 00:31:01,639
of programs basically adopting partial

709
00:30:58,999 --> 00:31:03,200
and and complete safe harbor complete

710
00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:05,238
authorization on the development close

711
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:09,350
if you follow you follow the program

712
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:11,480
guidelines about this we're totally

713
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:14,830
gonna be dying more into the safe harbor

714
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:17,450
anything cuz it's like my passion but

715
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:21,289
before we go into that I'm curious about

716
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:23,059
what are some like the new trends and

717
00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:24,980
lessons that we can learn from the US

718
00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:28,100
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act also known

719
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:32,749
as the FAA especially when it comes to

720
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:34,459
extortions and the recent indictment so

721
00:31:32,749 --> 00:31:38,570
what should we know about it what are

722
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:42,350
your toes absolutely so you know the

723
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:43,908
CFAA is a complex law that you shouldn't

724
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:46,428
you can read about each and again this

725
00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:49,039
is my person own personal views of my

726
00:31:46,429 --> 00:31:57,529
prior research and not legal advice do I

727
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:59,570
am a lawyer by training CFA is there is

728
00:31:57,529 --> 00:32:01,519
a lot of case law there is a lot of case

729
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:04,100
law around what is Association and what

730
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,830
is exceeding authorization but we also

731
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:10,248
have seen what I think is one of the

732
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:12,499
first at least you know publicly known

733
00:32:10,249 --> 00:32:15,019
we already have information about bug

734
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:18,440
bounty cases coming from the CFAA and

735
00:32:15,019 --> 00:32:21,080
that and that's reported according to

736
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:23,690
reports it involves Linda a subsidiary

737
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:26,779
of lindane and essentially what happened

738
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:30,039
there is two hackers were indicted they

739
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:33,379
were indicted we are at that stage for

740
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:35,600
extortion and conspiracy under the CFAA

741
00:32:33,379 --> 00:32:37,820
and it involved to some extent a bug

742
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,949
bounty because according to the reports

743
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:42,259
in the indictment what we had there is

744
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:45,379
basically an exchange an email coming

745
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:49,940
for the VDP saying well listen we found

746
00:32:45,379 --> 00:32:52,189
something big it doesn't look good we

747
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:54,889
have there so this is if you open up the

748
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:56,960
indictment you will definitely see the

749
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:59,899
all the information and the actual

750
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,940
correspondence and essentially the

751
00:32:59,899 --> 00:33:03,590
hackers told the corporation we found

752
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,909
something it's not looking good this is

753
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:08,119
what we have we have data we have

754
00:33:04,909 --> 00:33:08,840
passwords etc before we communicate this

755
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,220
we

756
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,639
you should know we were expecting a very

757
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:16,940
big payment not going into all the

758
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:20,299
details sufficient says that this

759
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:23,120
correspondence has led to indictment

760
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:25,970
under the CFAA so this be a very key

761
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:28,010
kind of message for the community which

762
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:31,789
is we must differentiate between

763
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:34,820
extortion and a bug bounty or a VDP if a

764
00:33:31,789 --> 00:33:36,679
researcher and and and again and I here

765
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:40,189
I really kind of recommend this into all

766
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:41,330
of lenore babies talks he's a special

767
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:43,190
consultant to the Department of Justice

768
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:44,689
and has a lot of experience in this

769
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,640
there are talks online where you can

770
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:48,169
find more information about this the

771
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,149
idea is that if you download the data

772
00:33:48,169 --> 00:33:52,279
essentially you are breaking the

773
00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:54,699
minimization clause that we often seen

774
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:57,350
but bounties or any piece talking about

775
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:59,270
once you see users data once you

776
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:01,039
escalate we got to get level with you

777
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:02,360
shouldn't get there and once you've got

778
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,549
there you got stuck right there

779
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:06,740
and once you don't download the bulk of

780
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:08,449
that it's really hard to make to

781
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:12,080
differentiate between the good guys and

782
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:14,118
the bad guys and especially if you are

783
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:16,159
making demands right so because bug

784
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:18,409
bounties are about incentivizing the

785
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,210
research community to disclose

786
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:22,339
vulnerabilities under a grid agreed-upon

787
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:25,190
terms which is the policy again and

788
00:34:22,339 --> 00:34:27,349
vulnerability disclosure policies which

789
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:29,869
are key and they're important and by the

790
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:32,119
way this is something the FTC also talks

791
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:33,859
about vulnerability disclosure program

792
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:35,810
are about the channels communication

793
00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:37,250
that if you found something you now have

794
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:39,139
a way to communicate that and

795
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:41,780
responsibly disclose that organization

796
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:43,909
this isn't about making demands or

797
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:45,440
extortion we can talk about you know

798
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:47,510
what should be the norms in this

799
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,210
community or the norm so the best

800
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:52,190
practices but we must you know make sure

801
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:55,129
that we differentiate the both if you

802
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:56,480
want this economy to work so this is one

803
00:34:55,129 --> 00:34:58,190
indictment and I think you know the

804
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,890
community should be carefully looking at

805
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:02,390
and again an educator I really kind of

806
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,920
recommend to everybody you wanna you

807
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:06,170
have the technical part all sorted out

808
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,849
you probably want to also know you know

809
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:11,170
what is the main landscape that is

810
00:35:07,849 --> 00:35:17,190
governing your core profession yeah

811
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:20,630
thanks what can we spend another future

812
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:23,789
when it comes to report motor abilities

813
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:26,160
yeah so that's it's a good question I I

814
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:29,670
think that you know right now obviously

815
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:33,270
the policy is set in stone it's it's

816
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:35,640
open for for all DoD websites I think

817
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:37,980
the future I think that that within

818
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,210
obviously I can't speak for all of the

819
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:42,720
federal government all right that's just

820
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:44,849
too too darn big but within the DoD I

821
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,848
think that there there is a increasing

822
00:35:44,849 --> 00:35:49,559
appetite we want to stay ahead of our

823
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:53,670
adversaries right it's all about having

824
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:55,589
that competitive edge and cyberspace you

825
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:58,950
know it is truly that's the next

826
00:35:55,589 --> 00:36:01,460
generation battlefield right so you when

827
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:03,750
you think about the DoD and you think of

828
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,880
what's on the back side of these

829
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:07,880
networks these are war fighting systems

830
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,440
in a lot of cases right these are are

831
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,420
truly life-and-death these are our

832
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,089
systems that we use to deter the bad

833
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:18,089
guys so I think that what you'll start

834
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:21,180
to see I think you may start to see a an

835
00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:22,980
expansion of the policy to open the

836
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:25,859
doors because right now it is limited I

837
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,450
think it was was a pilot that started

838
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:30,750
off but if you look at the language

839
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:32,578
within the Secretary of Defense memo it

840
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:35,210
was very clear that it's something that

841
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:38,190
that we look at in the DoD to mature and

842
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:40,140
and ultimately hopefully to expand out

843
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:42,329
beyond just websites because that's a

844
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:45,118
small portion like I said seven million

845
00:36:42,329 --> 00:36:47,490
connected devices online the websites

846
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,799
are a very small portion of what you

847
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:51,750
guys could and by you guys I mean the

848
00:36:49,799 --> 00:36:54,150
researchers what they can see and report

849
00:36:51,750 --> 00:37:00,000
on and I think we there's a there's an

850
00:36:54,150 --> 00:37:01,289
appetite for more thanks now curious on

851
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:08,160
here what are some trends that you're

852
00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:12,480
seeing in in bug bounty sure I could

853
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:13,020
take that one I guess so I just from our

854
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,680
perspective

855
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:19,049
I mean what we're seeing I mean from a

856
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:22,828
VDP D perspective is we're getting more

857
00:37:19,049 --> 00:37:27,480
and more things through showed and more

858
00:37:22,829 --> 00:37:31,010
mobile application vulnerabilities

859
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:33,330
misconfigurations and things like that

860
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:36,030
not a huge percentage of what we see on

861
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:50,160
a day-to-day basis but it's starting to

862
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:54,020
grow testing can you talk a little bit

863
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:56,700
about third-party testing yeah so

864
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:58,830
essentially this goes back to the issue

865
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,779
of in scope out of school by the way

866
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:02,640
also connects to the notion of safe

867
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:04,230
harbor because if you're running the

868
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,700
vulnerability disclosure program and if

869
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:08,310
you don't have a defined scope it's

870
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:10,319
really hard to just you know authorize

871
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:12,420
access to the whole word and give and

872
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,730
give particular you know complete legal

873
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:17,310
protections for the simple fact that the

874
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:19,710
basic you know the basic thing to do for

875
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:21,420
corporation is established why do I have

876
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:23,850
legal rights and that I can actually

877
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:26,460
invite the community to test and if I

878
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:28,710
need the community to test additional

879
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:30,869
additional components how do I obtain

880
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:34,140
those that legal rights through

881
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:36,180
contracts with the relevant parties in

882
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:38,910
the supply chain what we're seeing now

883
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:41,310
is growth advantage you also to some

884
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:44,009
extent encompass a lot of third-party

885
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:46,799
components that are embedded in or our

886
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:49,170
interaction in interaction with with

887
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,020
kind of the main program manager so that

888
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:55,560
goes again to the question of scope and

889
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:59,040
and that will require that will require

890
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:01,380
legal legal protections at plays that

891
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:04,440
probably mostly be b2b business to

892
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:07,350
business so we might see some something

893
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:09,690
changed changing there and you know

894
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:11,580
another trend that we're seeing and this

895
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:13,290
of course by the way gives us additional

896
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:15,119
insight because now we're using the bug

897
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:18,150
bounty to assess the security postures

898
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:20,580
of our vendors or or you know other

899
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:21,990
people outside the organization so it's

900
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:25,230
interesting but it requires a lot of

901
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:26,850
planning of course and you know you have

902
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:28,950
to have your back-end prepared for that

903
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:30,509
but also legal protections is something

904
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:34,109
for the researchers to be mindful as

905
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:36,270
well and I do interesting part is it's

906
00:39:34,109 --> 00:39:38,430
at least on the safe harbor landscape is

907
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:40,109
that we have seen Tesla not just

908
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:43,350
introducing a safe harbor but also

909
00:39:40,109 --> 00:39:45,029
giving researchers limb

910
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:46,710
if they follow their pre-approved

911
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:51,080
researchers working on the bug bounty

912
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:54,120
and following the guidelines again

913
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:55,799
basically giving them some kind of

914
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:59,009
protection from warranty limitations

915
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,450
saying if you test starts our car in

916
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:02,940
compliance with the bug bounty you are

917
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:05,939
pre-approved researcher we will not deem

918
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:08,760
your testing as violating the warranty

919
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:10,200
limitations and that's that's that could

920
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,020
be interesting to see how that will

921
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:15,660
develop when it comes to expensive

922
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:19,170
products embedded embedded security

923
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:22,350
testing and we'll see how this will work

924
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:24,420
out but definitely congratulations for

925
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:26,009
them for taking this and in part to say

926
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:29,160
that this is how I got my first back of

927
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:32,340
the coin by the way but walking with

928
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:34,980
with the tesla team i think it will it

929
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:42,930
will cause some kind of additional shift

930
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:46,770
in the legalese as well that maybe the

931
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:49,350
DSA yeah that's a it's it's a very

932
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:52,410
interesting topic of kind of what we're

933
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:54,990
seeing so I will I will kind of pile on

934
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:58,230
to a meets point and I will tell you

935
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:59,490
that I know specifically in the DoD we

936
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:02,370
have what's called the defense

937
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:04,229
industrial base the dip and the the Dib

938
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:05,819
is not because obviously you know the

939
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:07,860
DoD we don't really make a lot of stuff

940
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:11,730
right we're here for protection so we

941
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:14,610
rely on a host of of contractors and

942
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:16,350
vendors and suppliers that entire line

943
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:18,870
right that we call supply chain

944
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:21,390
management is at risk because even

945
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:25,080
though we can protect ourselves in the

946
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:26,670
DoD we don't have those that we don't

947
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:30,330
have the ability to provide safe harbor

948
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:32,610
for folks going after a corporation or

949
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:34,590
somebody that wants to submit so I think

950
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:36,900
that's a that's also one of those key

951
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:38,730
areas and and if you just you know you

952
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:41,100
look on some of the latest talks coming

953
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:44,430
out of the Pentagon there is there's

954
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:48,000
concern for that side of it how do how

955
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:50,730
does the DoD how do we provide a safe

956
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,940
operating space to develop deploy

957
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:57,390
operate maintain and lifecycle our

958
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:59,860
networks and then also the the

959
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:01,779
weapon systems on the backside so

960
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:03,820
obviously it's a concern I think that's

961
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:06,340
going to be a trend that will see moving

962
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:09,400
forward is how do we supply how do we

963
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:11,770
supply the company that makes the that

964
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,720
that produces the steel that makes the

965
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:17,040
bolt that eventually makes its way on to

966
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:19,899
an aircraft and protect those plans

967
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,940
comprehensively and within a unity of

968
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:25,540
effort I think it's a fascinating thing

969
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:33,850
and and maybe something a work on my

970
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:35,080
next master's degree for my thesis know

971
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:39,000
I gotta say everybody's pretty much

972
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:40,690
covered at all I have nothing to add

973
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,090
great

974
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:45,430
I was speaking a little bit more about

975
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:49,390
safe harbor and I mean it feel free to

976
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:52,990
like jump in anytime but you know we

977
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:56,529
just we have this closed audio over here

978
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:59,850
Casey had this idea one lifetime ago

979
00:42:56,530 --> 00:43:03,940
and he decided to make it go forward

980
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:05,890
back in 2016 he's like we gotta do it an

981
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:09,700
open source wanna really summarize

982
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:12,400
disclosure project which time didn't

983
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:14,770
really have much attention and it wasn't

984
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,470
even being addressed but I mean you were

985
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:19,690
actually on top of this book and which

986
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:21,100
is fascinating because I in case he

987
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:25,690
connected with you but along with

988
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:27,460
Dropbox which is fantastic because we

989
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:32,590
wouldn't be here without your assistance

990
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:34,360
of course yeah so Casey worked on it I

991
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:36,880
mean I guess well before I started my

992
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:39,820
research and you know after and I was

993
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:43,060
not aware I started my work on this

994
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:46,140
topic and you know and with you know

995
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:49,360
with how things changed in the community

996
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:53,410
you know you took you know the lead on

997
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:57,190
on basically we inspiring this

998
00:43:53,410 --> 00:44:01,600
initiative this close i/o which is a

999
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:03,760
socialization project the idea is you

1000
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:06,490
know we have one set of contract and as

1001
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,810
a platform you have although this is of

1002
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:10,359
course nothing associated with one

1003
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:12,340
platform but again the idea here

1004
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:14,020
many program managers are of course

1005
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:15,640
looking at what you know what's going

1006
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,870
around on the platen what's the default

1007
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,730
language for the platform which

1008
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:21,730
background also changed in food safe

1009
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:23,980
harbor and also hacker one which was a

1010
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:25,480
big big shift for bug for the safe

1011
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:28,690
harbor initiative it actually caused

1012
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:30,850
major adoption in the market and the

1013
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:32,530
idea behind this Rosario is you have

1014
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:35,049
that language but what's new and what's

1015
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:37,270
really exciting and kind of following

1016
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:40,540
what I worked in my paper to two years

1017
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:42,940
ago is this idea is that not only we're

1018
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:45,460
gonna have a safe harbor but also we're

1019
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:47,860
gonna have a disclosure mechanism that

1020
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:49,810
will allow searchers to basically look

1021
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:52,960
for those specific programs that have

1022
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:55,420
more bustable protections and by virtue

1023
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:58,690
of basically having that simplified you

1024
00:44:55,420 --> 00:45:00,850
know filter on merely a button what I

1025
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:04,090
called a race to the top because we have

1026
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:05,500
a reputational mechanism so until and

1027
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:08,320
I'm talking about the empirical

1028
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:11,020
landscape we know from data that until

1029
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:13,210
around 2016 the legal protection at

1030
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:15,520
least on on data coming from hacker one

1031
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:17,140
with around 70 programs the legal

1032
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,850
protection component of the of the

1033
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:20,440
policy didn't affect the quality of the

1034
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:24,790
vulnerabilities coming in in the bug

1035
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:27,090
bounty I'm talking about but this is

1036
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:29,680
data from January 2016 a lot has changed

1037
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:31,510
then at back then we talked about only

1038
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:34,390
partial safe harbors and only 17

1039
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:35,350
programs around that that scale by the

1040
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:38,080
way if you're looking for the paper

1041
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:39,900
that's by minge Zhou at L you can find

1042
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:43,600
it on Google Scholar it's a great paper

1043
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:45,160
and essentially we know a lot has

1044
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:47,380
changed and now it will be very

1045
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:50,500
interesting to see how that very simple

1046
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:52,930
mechanism of a reputational having that

1047
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:55,300
reputational simplified score tool that

1048
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:57,669
now hackers can go on background and on

1049
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:59,680
the program directory and just look for

1050
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:02,620
safe harbor just to distinguish between

1051
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:05,799
programs according to safe harbor will

1052
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:08,830
actually may be incentivized incentivize

1053
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:11,440
more more buck submissions coming to

1054
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:13,090
those programs now it's also important

1055
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:16,750
to know that even though we have that

1056
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:19,570
filter you should always carefully look

1057
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:21,310
and read the terms and always seek your

1058
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:23,050
own legal advice

1059
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:25,060
because you know no filter in the world

1060
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:26,950
can can give you you know what you will

1061
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:28,840
get from reading the actual terms and

1062
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:30,759
usually they are short sometimes there

1063
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:33,010
are hyperlink contracts you should also

1064
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,350
be mindful to the platform contract so

1065
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:37,150
the platform has contracts that you

1066
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:40,210
accept when you sign in to the home to

1067
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:43,360
the platform but bottom line I truly

1068
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:46,420
hope that this type of simplified

1069
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:48,460
exposure mechanism will will you know

1070
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:49,870
with the help of this close IO and Hackl

1071
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:53,260
on and background the community in

1072
00:46:49,870 --> 00:47:00,279
general will do great things for this

1073
00:46:53,260 --> 00:47:02,350
initiative yeah it's two parts one is

1074
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:04,750
actually desirable ability to disclose

1075
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:07,569
our language so excuse both companies

1076
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:09,700
and hackers safe when disclosing the

1077
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:13,810
other part is the list that I mean

1078
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:17,770
mentioned this list is basically the

1079
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:20,680
directory for hackers in a sense I mean

1080
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:25,090
ballistamon started back in 2012 over a

1081
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:28,450
blog post and Casey's like a fine if I'm

1082
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:28,810
missing any like submit something let me

1083
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:30,460
know

1084
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:34,060
it'll add it to list and give you

1085
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:37,840
recognition we now have over 800 entries

1086
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:42,310
on this list and it's growing because of

1087
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:44,410
the wonderful crowd and it is fantastic

1088
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:47,580
to see this kind of feedback Bluecoats

1089
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:52,629
people taking safe-harbor seriously

1090
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:54,819
which is fantastic and also it's good to

1091
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:56,890
note that there's this bilateral safe

1092
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:59,770
harbor there's protection for good-faith

1093
00:47:56,890 --> 00:48:02,740
hackers while maintaining legal

1094
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:07,300
protection for programs as well from

1095
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:09,399
malicious ones I do know that we are

1096
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:11,470
close on time here and I want to make

1097
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:14,800
sure that the crowd has time to ask any

1098
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:16,859
questions if anyone and out there has

1099
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:21,250
any questions for this wonderful panel

1100
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:25,060
feel free to DM me on Twitter at Chloe

1101
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:27,910
Muskogee or simply just tweet away by

1102
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:28,980
crowd and I'm checking right now so on

1103
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:33,029
my phone

1104
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:33,030
they're asking for one second

1105
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:40,590
this is a situation on the line I just

1106
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:47,310
wanted to ask our panelists general

1107
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:49,530
question if that's cool awesome I mean I

1108
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:51,299
am I had the opportunity to come to one

1109
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:54,240
of your lectures really recently and

1110
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:56,370
talk about the topic of a vulnerability

1111
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:59,669
disclosure and how it affected a bounty

1112
00:48:56,370 --> 00:49:01,650
hunter like myself and although there

1113
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:05,510
are a lot of companies that have moved

1114
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:07,680
towards safe harbor exclusions in their

1115
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:09,180
their safe harbor language in their

1116
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,859
bounties and they're responsible

1117
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:12,450
disclosure programs there there are

1118
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:16,590
still a lot of sites that I use every

1119
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:18,029
day that that don't have any specific

1120
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:20,130
way to report a vulnerability and I've

1121
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:22,770
been on the side of having been a

1122
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:24,900
security professional just using an

1123
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:28,500
e-commerce site finding a vulnerability

1124
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:31,260
that was glaringly obvious and been in

1125
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:33,660
that moral dilemma of do I report this

1126
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:35,700
vulnerability to this private

1127
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:37,080
organization when I know that some how

1128
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,879
many gonna do the DoD but it's

1129
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:41,220
definitely a question that is front of

1130
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,350
mine for a lot of hackers what is what

1131
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:44,669
is your personal recommendation when

1132
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:46,259
something like that happens I know

1133
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:48,090
you're not anyone's lawyer here but

1134
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:50,510
you've talked about the slot in the past

1135
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:53,250
and do we report these vulnerabilities

1136
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:56,490
do we keep ourselves safe because the

1137
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:59,430
risk of legal action is you know it's

1138
00:49:56,490 --> 00:50:01,859
too high is there indicators that you

1139
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:03,379
can flush out that maybe mean that this

1140
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:04,950
organization is receptive to receiving

1141
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:06,570
vulnerabilities even though they don't

1142
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:11,490
have a policy online what are your

1143
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:13,080
thoughts there again and I'm also this

1144
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:16,649
is not a good vice I'm and only

1145
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:18,990
expressing my own personal views there

1146
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:23,340
are two things going around here first

1147
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:29,250
we know from prior FTC cases and from

1148
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:32,580
just public you know testimony is that

1149
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:36,750
were wild with some Congress committees

1150
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:38,430
that the FTC views not having some kind

1151
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:41,940
of an educated process to deal with

1152
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:45,210
vulnerabilities as potentially

1153
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:46,530
unreasonable and under the FTC act so

1154
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:48,360
it's not it's

1155
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:51,360
and just in general it's not just good

1156
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:53,640
practice to have a VDP or some kind of a

1157
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:56,130
process to communicate with the external

1158
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:58,259
community research with the research

1159
00:50:56,130 --> 00:51:00,720
community it's also in potential

1160
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:02,910
violation of the law of the FTC Act and

1161
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:06,089
the FTC have has gone after two

1162
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:07,770
companies in the past or two cases at

1163
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:09,840
least where that was a part of the

1164
00:51:07,770 --> 00:51:12,630
official complaint so it's important to

1165
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:14,970
recognize that it's not although we have

1166
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:17,670
a very we have a vague legal landscape

1167
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:20,879
that is sometimes undermining security

1168
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:24,000
research you know in some cases we also

1169
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:27,330
have recommendations by regulators and

1170
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,310
this this this kind of prior cases from

1171
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:31,140
the FTC saying you need to work with the

1172
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:33,420
external security research community to

1173
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:36,060
have some kind of process in place that

1174
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:38,460
being said later today EF F is going to

1175
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:40,710
be talking with the community and also

1176
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:43,350
also really talking about this specific

1177
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:45,650
point of the legalists EF F is an

1178
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:47,940
organization you should know and

1179
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:49,980
hopefully you know if you're more into

1180
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:53,130
interested in that read about them they

1181
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:55,200
provide basically free legal advice in

1182
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:59,070
some cases and you're gonna hear from

1183
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:01,859
them later today just my personal

1184
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:05,250
experience as an academic that reported

1185
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:10,710
vulnerabilities fruit bug bounties to

1186
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:12,600
companies it's always good to have some

1187
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:14,490
kind of relationship with the security

1188
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:17,100
with the researchers that are working on

1189
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:19,319
your products in terms of knowing

1190
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:21,480
potentially trying through connections

1191
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:23,850
to kind of assess who is this

1192
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:27,870
organization how they dealt with this

1193
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:29,610
kind of cases in the past and of course

1194
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:31,470
there are coordinators like the cert

1195
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:34,530
there are organizations that can help

1196
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:36,959
you disclose and you know there are

1197
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:39,330
additional kind of paths you can take to

1198
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:42,840
disclose in case the company doesn't

1199
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:45,060
have a VPS place given that you know

1200
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:47,250
giving the current giving the situation

1201
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:49,620
and giving just a landscape of you know

1202
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:52,140
the legal anti hacking laws yes you

1203
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:54,420
should be mindful that there are legal

1204
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:56,790
risk associated I mean this is something

1205
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:58,380
you should be considered considering but

1206
00:52:56,790 --> 00:53:00,270
you should also be mindful that

1207
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:03,810
companies should should have

1208
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:05,460
it's place and this is not and this is

1209
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:09,540
something regulators recommend and we

1210
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:11,580
also have actionable kind of case cases

1211
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:14,850
and complaints suggesting that these are

1212
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:16,770
the best practices so if an organization

1213
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:18,990
doesn't have an an any process at place

1214
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:21,330
they should potentially consider how

1215
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:22,830
they can improve their posture to better

1216
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:24,630
follow at least what we're seeing from

1217
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:27,420
the FTC and the recommendations of

1218
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:29,760
regulators so I hope that touched the

1219
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:32,220
phone a few items I think you know

1220
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:34,530
definitely FF would have a lot to say

1221
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:36,149
better today and you know you can you

1222
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:39,600
can see and you can learn from them and

1223
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:41,190
ask the questions for them as well they

1224
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:56,190
certainly have a lot of experience with

1225
00:53:41,190 --> 00:54:06,960
that what do you mean by or what what is

1226
00:53:56,190 --> 00:54:09,780
meant by no program may be specifically

1227
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,280
out of scope like mission comes in

1228
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:12,930
through the program and it was in good

1229
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,900
faith to offer it to you guys but it's

1230
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:17,310
not a not an asset that can scope for

1231
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,360
you guys I think maybe you mentioned it

1232
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:21,710
before that you can go through other

1233
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:21,710
organizations to report those things

1234
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:31,500
it's sure so so we a couple of routes we

1235
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:36,750
go kind of ad hoc you know we can try to

1236
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:39,180
find some path forward with that usually

1237
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:40,740
the fallback is you could always like

1238
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:42,330
report that through us search and

1239
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:47,009
they'll they'll work it through their

1240
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:48,509
their processes but yeah I mean we we

1241
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:50,250
get a lot of unusual things that could

1242
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:52,830
be considered out of scope or definitely

1243
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:56,190
out of scope that we're able to work and

1244
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:56,759
we always do our best to try to get that

1245
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:59,640
done

1246
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:03,870
I mean even so far as to get things in

1247
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:07,440
where folks are finding stuff on and get

1248
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:09,990
repos and we're able to work that and

1249
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:13,650
get like you know information disclosed

1250
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:16,859
you've moved at pulled from get so you

1251
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:19,019
we we tend to be able to like work a lot

1252
00:55:16,859 --> 00:55:21,480
of these issues and then like I said you

1253
00:55:19,019 --> 00:55:27,689
know us-cert being the other option if

1254
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:29,640
you can't write thanks John thank you I

1255

language and the core terms it just

1271
00:56:09,509 --> 00:56:15,900
closed IO because it takes a crowd
