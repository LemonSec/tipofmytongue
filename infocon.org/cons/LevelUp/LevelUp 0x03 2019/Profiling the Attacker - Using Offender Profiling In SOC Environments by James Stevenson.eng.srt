1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:11,049
all right everyone thank you so much for

2
00:00:08,219 --> 00:00:14,018
joining us and without further ado we'll

3
00:00:11,049 --> 00:00:16,509
give it away to James too for his talk

4
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:18,700
profiling the attacker thanks James

5
00:00:16,509 --> 00:00:20,590
thanks yeah everyone first of all thanks

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,750
all for coming along so I used to start

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,460
this talk off with a quote it was a bit

8
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,200
buzz witty but and generally it got the

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,759
point across recently though I've been

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,070
starting this talk with a question

11
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:33,910
instead and that's the question of what

12
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,960
does Agent Smith from the matrix I think

13
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,639
I've crashed very good

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,620
what is it inspect from the matrix what

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,870
is the Joker from Batman and what is

16
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:44,230
Darth Vader from Star Wars all have in

17
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:46,330
common and it's not the fact that

18
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:48,940
they're all from movies nor is it the

19
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:49,989
fact that they're all villains but

20
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,839
instead it's the fact that they're all

21
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:55,210
villains with motives and purposes the

22
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:59,140
fact that they all do what they do for a

23
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:00,850
reason be that enslaving humanity in the

24
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,250
matrix or building the Death Star in

25
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:05,170
Star Wars all of these villains have

26
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:07,360
that motive and have that purpose and

27
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:09,820
then generally in these movies will see

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,220
those villains or will see heroes use

29
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:14,610
those motives and purposes against the

30
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,479
villains in one way or another and

31
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,100
that's what we're gonna be talking about

32
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,770
today we're going to be talking about

33
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,990
how we can use offender profiling to get

34
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:26,170
that motive to get that purpose from

35
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:28,690
malicious actors so coming back to that

36
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,610
quote it's the idea that pre-emptive

37
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:32,830
security is the idea of doing something

38
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:34,869
now spending some money now spending

39
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:38,530
some time now to help protect ourselves

40
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:41,320
in the future an offender profiling is a

41
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:43,210
type of pre-emptive security so then if

42
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,070
we can put some security precautions in

43
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:48,339
place now that can help us protect

44
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,419
ourselves in the future so what am I

45
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,130
actually gonna be talking about today

46
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,200
well I'm gonna break it down into three

47
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:55,929
main areas I wanna talk about what

48
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,340
offender profiling actually is I want to

49
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,590
talk about what already exists some

50
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,750
white papers some research papers that

51
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,710
use offender profiling and then finally

52
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,570
I want to talk about how we can use

53
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:07,990
offender profiling in security

54
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:10,060
operations but before I do that online

55
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:11,709
well my name is Jim Stevenson and this

56
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,689
time two years ago now I was a student

57
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:16,299
at the invited South Wales in the UK

58
00:02:13,689 --> 00:02:17,888
studying computer security before that I

59
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:18,660
was a scourge analyst and a company

60
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:21,150
called hood

61
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,490
and these days I'm a graduate in beauty

62
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,200
security I've also run a few websites

63
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,880
and we'll get to those later on and I'm

64
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,380
also on Twitter and under school gym

65
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,590
students and so free to shove me any

66
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,400
questions now as well so jumping

67
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,800
straight into it

68
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,460
what is offender profiling I keep

69
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,690
talking about it but what actually is it

70
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,700
so offender profiling is all about

71
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,410
building a knowledge base on a malicious

72
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,820
actor it's all about getting all of that

73
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:48,540
information and using that information

74
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:50,700
to better protect us so it really comes

75
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,920
down to free main areas the first part

76
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,299
of that is information on the target the

77
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,820
who and the what

78
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,160
who is the target are they an individual

79
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:02,220
a group a government organization and

80
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,799
what was targeted what specific asset

81
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,290
was targeted next it's all about

82
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,080
information on the attacker again the

83
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,269
WHO and the want as an individual group

84
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,330
of a state-sponsored and what attack

85
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:16,560
vector did they use finally a fillip

86
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,600
profiling and building this knowledge

87
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,510
base it's just got some general and

88
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,609
overall information and that's when did

89
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,530
this attack occur and why'd this attack

90
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:27,480
occur and again it's all of this

91
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,790
information that comes together to build

92
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,170
that knowledge base now there's an

93
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,280
example I like giving for offender

94
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,690
profiling and I'll be honest I like

95
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,520
giving it because it's simple easy to

96
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,050
get our heads around it's the idea of a

97
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,330
dos attack or denial of service attack

98
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,890
so let's say we are protecting a

99
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,360
customers Network and they're

100
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,369
continually getting tossed by a

101
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,370
Scandinavian hacker group between the

102
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,450
hours of 3:00 and 6:00 each day and then

103
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,050
for the rest of the day it's drips and

104
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:54,299
drabs we can tell our customer ok put

105
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:56,010
extra load balances in place at these

106
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:59,130
times and then for the rest of the day

107
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:01,440
use what you usually have so here we're

108
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:03,480
using offender profiling pre-emptive

109
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,500
security and some general security

110
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:09,570
techniques to help protect our customer

111
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:12,090
so if that's what offender profiling is

112
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:14,130
why is offender profiling important why

113
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,630
do we actually need it well this is a

114
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,070
quote from a Los Angeles police chief

115
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,630
and it's actually do a predictive

116
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,959
policing but I think it describes

117
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:23,640
offender profiling quite well it's the

118
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,219
idea that we're not getting more money

119
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,200
we're not getting more stuff we have to

120
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:31,590
use what we have now effectively and

121
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,820
this is the same insecurity Security's

122
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,710
at the buzzword it once

123
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,159
it doesn't have the endless budgets it

124
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:40,770
once did it's all about utilization

125
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,240
using what we have here an ale so then

126
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,789
if we can implement these security

127
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,720
measures now and that can help us in the

128
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:51,480
future so if that's why I offender

129
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,800
profiling is important why is security

130
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,930
important because we wouldn't be here

131
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,360
today if we didn't believe security was

132
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,190
important well this is a statistic from

133
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,600
have I been poned if you don't know

134
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,340
having ponents comes that massive online

135
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,650
database of breached account credentials

136
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,299
you type your address in and it tells

137
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:08,640
you if your account has been compromised

138
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,410
so this is the amount of accounts that

139
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:14,010
were less didn't have any pounds on the

140
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,810
12 for second 2018 and this number is

141
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,670
really interesting it's really

142
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,410
interesting for two reasons it's

143
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,330
interesting more because it's a massive

144
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:23,970
number but it's also interesting because

145
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:26,070
it shows us security isn't going

146
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,200
anywhere it shows us Security's in it

147
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:30,180
for the long haul because as long as we

148
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,979
have things you have things that can be

149
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,840
broken as long as we have things that

150
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:37,290
can be broken we have things that need

151
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,270
protecting so if that's what offender

152
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:42,060
profiling is and why offender profiling

153
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:44,400
is important what already exists on some

154
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:47,700
white papers some research papers that

155
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,109
use offender profiling well this is a

156
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,060
white paper by mandiant it's probably

157
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:53,190
the first white paper over reg it's on a

158
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,320
PT one Chinese hacker group that targets

159
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:56,240
Western organizations believe it to be

160
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,380
state-sponsored

161
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,390
the white paper goes into who the

162
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:03,240
malicious actors are it goes into their

163
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:05,340
motives their actions and all in all it

164
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,700
builds a bigger picture on who they are

165
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:10,919
and what they do the next white people

166
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:13,500
we have is by f-secure this one goes

167
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,210
into the Callisto group but again builds

168
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,670
that bigger picture looks at their

169
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:21,359
motives their attack patterns and what

170
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:23,040
makes them who they are and then finally

171
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,210
I'll find a white paper we have a white

172
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,920
paper by McAfee

173
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,930
now this is McAfee's annual threat

174
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,160
report this white paper goes into a

175
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,200
whole range of different malicious

176
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,930
actors different motives different tack

177
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:37,200
patterns but again builds that bigger

178
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:38,520
picture on all of them and we can

179
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,310
probably start seeing a pattern here

180
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,229
because offender profiling is all about

181
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:45,540
that bigger picture it's all about

182
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,620
understanding that bigger picture so

183
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:51,330
that we can better protect

184
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:52,230
selves or our customers so as I said

185
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,789
earlier I used to work for a company

186
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:56,160
called alert logic I used to work in

187
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,570
their security operation center and a

188
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,580
very high level we can break our

189
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:01,469
security operations in two weeks down

190
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,810
into two main elements we have our

191
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:06,600
customer and we have our stock our

192
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:08,220
security operation center our customer

193
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,130
will have an IDs an intrusion detection

194
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,980
system a woth web application firewall

195
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:16,980
or some sort of login system well then

196
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:18,690
send those logs to our sock our sock

197
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,820
will have an analyst who will review

198
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:22,920
those logs but say well what's actually

199
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,860
happening here is this a false positive

200
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,810
is this a false negative well then write

201
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,960
up something with feedback and send that

202
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:32,040
back to the customer and generally that

203
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,930
works really well we get this kind of

204
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,660
really good feedback loop we get logs

205
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:39,240
analysis feedback and as I said

206
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,800
generally that works really well now

207
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,060
where that doesn't work really well is

208
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,340
that generally we're only ever looking

209
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,350
at one attack at a time we're not

210
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,630
looking at the bigger picture of which

211
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:51,450
we said was so important for offender

212
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:53,460
profiling so how can we implement

213
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:56,280
offender profiling into security

214
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:58,200
operations well we can do it because

215
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,030
it's already been done one of the ways

216
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,580
that we do this is by latching on a

217
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:04,530
framework for offender profiling to what

218
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:06,150
already exists and so they've kind of

219
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:09,119
starting afresh we just add offender

220
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:10,799
profiling into what we have so the way

221
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,380
that this works is we take our logs from

222
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,360
our customer as usual we analyze them as

223
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,640
usual but then we start bucketing that

224
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,050
information we say well this attack is

225
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,450
related to intact you had a month ago

226
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:23,550
this attack related to executive week

227
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:25,500
ago and this attack is really will never

228
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:27,840
attack another one of our customers is

229
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,150
head and then we can send that bucket

230
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,490
information back to the customer with

231
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:33,799
our normal analysis allowing our

232
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,450
customer to look at that bigger picture

233
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:39,839
allowing them to prioritize and compare

234
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:41,340
attacks as a whole now you might still

235
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,130
be on the fence about why we need

236
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:46,290
offender profiling well this is Alice

237
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:49,050
and Alice is an analyst for an

238
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,969
up-and-coming security startup it's

239
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:53,609
Alice's job to do just that it's your

240
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:56,010
job to review security incidents as they

241
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,780
come in and generally this works really

242
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,610
well here in a team will then action

243
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,270
those incidents and that may be anything

244
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,670
from

245
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:05,970
remoting into a system calling up a

246
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:07,319
customer or weightings and feedback and

247
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:10,350
as I said generally that works really

248
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,930
well now where that doesn't work really

249
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,649
well is that when Alice in a team gets

250
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,829
swamped

251
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:18,959
they really get swamped and that's

252
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:21,660
because these attacks are prioritized on

253
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:25,349
time so the sooner an attack comes in

254
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:27,449
the higher priority it has now the

255
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:30,450
problem with this is that we get high

256
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:33,839
risk attacks being lost in a sea of

257
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:36,390
low-risk attacks and Alex doesn't like

258
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,980
this Alice wants to find a way for her

259
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:41,160
in a team to prioritize these attacks

260
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:45,420
based on other factors factors like risk

261
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,860
likelihoods impact outside of time and

262
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,870
this is what we're gonna be talking

263
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,100
about for the rest of today we're gonna

264
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,620
be talking about how we can build a

265
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:55,940
framework that uses these methods to

266
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:58,800
profile attacks and malicious actors and

267
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:00,899
now when Allison our team received these

268
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,760
security incidents they're safe in

269
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:05,220
knowing that they're prioritized on risk

270
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:08,630
or likelihood or impact and at the

271
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,589
higher the risk the higher the priority

272
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:12,300
so you might be thinking okay James

273
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:14,310
that's great surely it's time to dive

274
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,069
into our first methods for offender

275
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:19,319
profiling well not quite before we do

276
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:22,500
that we're going to jump into something

277
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,270
I like to call method 0 now method 0 is

278
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,220
all about understanding what we're

279
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:28,020
protecting because at the end of the day

280
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,180
we can't protect something that we don't

281
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:33,510
know so it's all to do with asset

282
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:35,880
profiling so as I said earlier I own a

283
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:37,680
website James feeling sand got me that's

284
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,110
an asset that's something I'm protecting

285
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,329
that's its name well its classification

286
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,760
is that asset high risk or is it low

287
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:46,170
risk it's description well it's a

288
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,689
wordpress website running an email

289
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:50,880
server back-end its owner custodian

290
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,350
that's myself and then finally excusa

291
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,439
that's the public that's you are knowing

292
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:57,990
and again the reason why we classify all

293
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,450
profile our assets is just to understand

294
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:04,459
what we're actually protecting because

295
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:05,810
we can't protect what we don't know so

296
00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:07,189
jumping into

297
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,859
first real method for a fender

298
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:11,150
programming method one now I'm a fan of

299
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,190
the name of this method because actually

300
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:14,209
describes what it's trying to do because

301
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:16,640
it's all to do with plotting the

302
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:19,010
frequency of attacks we take a time

303
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,410
frame and we look at whenever a specific

304
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:24,050
malicious actor attacks a specific asset

305
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:26,300
and whenever they do we increase their

306
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:28,760
frequency and when they don't we

307
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,910
decrease the frequency so what we end up

308
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,560
getting is these peaks and troughs and

309
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:36,410
that's really useful because that that

310
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,670
allows us to compare malicious actors so

311
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,800
here we can see two different malicious

312
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,870
actors we can see a malicious actor from

313
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,599
China in a blue and a malicious actor

314
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:46,370
from Russia in a red we can see that the

315
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,200
malicious actor from China continues to

316
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:50,000
attack the asset throughout this time

317
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,580
frame while the moistures actor from

318
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,450
Russia attacks stompers attack stops and

319
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:58,460
continues so then if this was the only

320
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:01,790
information we had which of those two

321
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:03,080
attacks would we prioritize well it'd

322
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,400
probably be the Chinese mother's

323
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,529
respective right because that way is far

324
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,900
more frequent it's far more pressing on

325
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:13,220
us for our customers well the one from

326
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:15,800
Russia is just blesser moving on to our

327
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:17,900
next method for offender profiling this

328
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,300
method looks at risk it says what is the

329
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:23,030
risk of this attack to my or my

330
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:24,609
customers organization the way that this

331
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:27,620
works is we break it up into two areas

332
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:29,620
likelihood and impact and then we then

333
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,670
ask several questions in those areas

334
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:34,430
questions like the complexity of attack

335
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:36,319
ease of discovery ease of exploit lots

336
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:39,469
of confidentiality integrity and

337
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:42,640
availability we then give each of those

338
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:45,230
questions a score between zero and ten

339
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,930
take an average from each of those

340
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:50,690
sections times them together and then we

341
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:54,229
get our overall risk where the higher

342
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:56,209
the number the higher the risk so then

343
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:58,730
if we've profiled two malicious actors

344
00:12:56,209 --> 00:13:00,709
when malicious actor with a risk of 70

345
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:02,959
and one malicious actor with a risk of

346
00:13:00,709 --> 00:13:04,969
30 if that was the only information we

347
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,189
had which of those monstrous actors

348
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:09,110
would we prioritize well it'd be the

349
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:10,400
moistures actor with the risk of 70

350
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,760
right because that one is intrinsically

351
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,760
higher

352
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:18,710
one to our next method for offender

353
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:21,199
profiling no key I really didn't want to

354
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:22,670
talk about the cyber kill chain some

355
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,950
people love the cyber kill chain and

356
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,180
some people hate the cyber kill chain so

357
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:28,640
if you don't know the cyber kill chain

358
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,530
is a method by Lockheed Martin for

359
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,600
analyzing the life cycle of malware

360
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,860
exploitation generally it works really

361
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,570
well there's several areas from

362
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,640
reconnaissance to weaponization to

363
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:39,680
actions of objectives and ants that

364
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,090
generally it works really well the main

365
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,280
problem with it is it's generally

366
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:45,440
overused it's used in a whole range of

367
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:48,709
areas and security but really it's only

368
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,510
designed for malware exploitation so

369
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:52,070
today for profiling our malicious actors

370
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:54,640
we're gonna look at a far more generic

371
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:57,560
kill chain model the computer security a

372
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,870
module that has five areas of which a

373
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,540
malicious actor might undergo as part of

374
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:04,280
their attack sections like research in

375
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,740
the target testing infrastructure

376
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,600
actively attacking actions which is

377
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:10,700
doing the thing and then finally

378
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,160
covering tracks and planting backdoors

379
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,480
and you might be thinking well James

380
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,390
that's great but what does this have to

381
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,310
do with offender profiling and the

382
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:21,470
reason why we do this is so that we can

383
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:24,319
pin these categories to our malicious

384
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,310
actors so that we can say well at this

385
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,950
time in date

386
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:30,369
malicious actor a was in the research

387
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:33,350
stage well at this same time a date

388
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:36,950
malicious actor B was in the actions

389
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:39,230
stage so again if that was the only

390
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:42,040
information we had which of those two

391
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:44,120
malicious actors would we prioritize

392
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,860
well it would be the malicious actor in

393
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,440
the actions stage right because that one

394
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:50,390
is favored and long in their attack the

395
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:55,190
multi-sector in the research stage may

396
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:56,780
never get to the actions stage so our

397
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:59,270
penultimate method for a friend of

398
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:01,339
profiling can be the easiest or it can

399
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:04,010
be the most complex because it's all to

400
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:05,840
do with asking questions questions on

401
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:09,380
the target and questions on the

402
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:11,810
malicious actor questions like well who

403
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:14,510
was the target with an individual a

404
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:17,569
group with a government organization and

405
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:19,640
was anyone else targeted was this part

406
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:21,290
of a massive reconnaissance attack or

407
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,860
was this part of an individual spear

408
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:26,640
phishing attack and then why were they

409
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,950
targeted for example

410
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:33,360
why was company a targeted and not

411
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:35,459
Company B next or targeted next we ask

412
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,829
questions on the militia secretary if we

413
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:39,839
know the answers questions again like

414
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:41,579
well who were they within individual

415
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,700
within a group when they state-sponsored

416
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:48,479
and what were their motivations was it

417
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:50,130
malicious financial activism and then

418
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,170
finally did anything happen leading up

419
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:54,689
to the attack was there anything in the

420
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:57,599
news we learning in laws or legislation

421
00:15:54,690 --> 00:16:01,320
passed or did we or our customers

422
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,149
receive any France and it's the answers

423
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,820
to all of these questions that allow us

424
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:08,100
to answer this final question and notes

425
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,450
with the knowledge we have now with the

426
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,820
knowledge we have on the attacker and

427
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:14,910
then knowledge we have on the target is

428
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:16,350
this attack likely to continue because

429
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:18,740
building a knowledge base is great

430
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:21,329
looking at the bigger picture is great

431
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:26,279
but understanding if we're still at risk

432
00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:28,189
is far more important so moving on to

433
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:30,540
our final method for offender profiling

434
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:33,149
this is called method five but really

435
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:34,439
could be called method 0.5 because

436
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:37,890
instead of looking at offender profiling

437
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:40,079
it looks at offender categorizing it

438
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:42,089
says well can we create a sub unique and

439
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,040
naming convention for our malicious

440
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:46,949
actors that we can instantly glean

441
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,709
information from the way that this works

442
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:51,120
is we break that name up into four areas

443
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:53,369
the location where they first saw the

444
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,740
most sector from the date we first saw

445
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:56,940
the moisture sector the risk score for

446
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,940
that monitor sector which is what we

447
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:02,010
worked out earlier on and then finally

448
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:04,020
the loss of text of the first scene or

449
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:05,819
most common IP address for that

450
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,410
malicious sector and that just kind of

451
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:10,470
gives to this sub unique naming

452
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:12,059
convention so here we could use an IP

453
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,799
address we could use a MAC address we

454
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:15,809
could even use a hash to identify our

455
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:20,609
militia sector this is just one example

456
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:22,319
of something we could use so wrapping up

457
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:25,559
we've looked at what offender profiling

458
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,849
is we don't why it's important we looked

459
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:28,830
at different types of offender profiling

460
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:30,510
and we've also looked at how we can

461
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:33,600
implement offender profiling into

462
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:34,800
security operations the real takeaway of

463
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,469
this talk though comes in around the

464
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:39,970
next 50 seconds and it's inspired by

465
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:42,429
this quote it's the idea

466
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:44,379
intrusion analysis security analysis

467
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:47,500
there are about far more than the tools

468
00:17:44,379 --> 00:17:50,139
we use generally there are about

469
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,610
understanding something and in case

470
00:17:50,139 --> 00:17:54,158
where that's about understanding an

471
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:56,799
attack offender profiling shows us that

472
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:59,529
every attack is orchestrated and has a

473
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:02,950
motive and a purpose and in better

474
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:05,200
understanding that motive and purpose we

475
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:07,389
can better protect ourselves and our

476
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,080
customers so thank you all for coming

477
00:18:07,389 --> 00:18:09,668
along

478
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,928
I'll grab on the Twitter now to see if

479
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:14,710
there are any questions but so feel free

480
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:16,750
to fire away on the hashtag and if it's

481
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:22,750
not I'll leave it to the next next

482
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:26,080
speaker yes I don't think there are any

483
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:27,250
questions scrolling through yeah thanks

484
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,389
thanks everyone for coming along and

485
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,600
thanks to a broad crowd for having me

486
00:18:28,389 --> 00:18:30,600
here today
