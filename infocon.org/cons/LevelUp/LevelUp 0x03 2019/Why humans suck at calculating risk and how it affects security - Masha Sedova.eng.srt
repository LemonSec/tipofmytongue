1
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:12,010
so hi everybody my name is Masha Sedova

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:13,660
and I'm presenting on how we humans suck

3
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:17,380
at calculating risk and how it affects

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:19,900
security quick intro about me I've been

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:23,250
in security space for 17 18 years

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:25,479
starting on traditional field of

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:29,289
forensics if you call that traditional

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,759
and 2012 started a team called security

9
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:32,140
engagement at Salesforce where I was

10
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:34,870
responsible for the internal security

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:37,870
best practices for the company for

12
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,489
researchers developers and when I was

13
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,050
there I became obsessed with this

14
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:42,910
question of what would it look like if

15
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:48,399
people wanted to do security instead of

16
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:50,319
had to and so I started my research into

17
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,020
the field outside security that took me

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,289
to behavioral science positive

19
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:58,239
psychology and game design where I

20
00:00:56,289 --> 00:01:00,129
created framework that actually shifted

21
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,669
behavior in a significant and measurable

22
00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:05,530
way at Salesforce and I used that to

23
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,480
build the foundation of the company that

24
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,650
I currently run called elevate security

25
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,320
which is building a platform in the

26
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:12,700
space so based on that experience I'm

27
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,658
really excited to talk to you all today

28
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,560
about how we can use the elements of

29
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:19,780
behavioral science

30
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,900
I've taught us around risk calculations

31
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:25,000
and how it affects security decisions so

32
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,710
I really want to do is talk because

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,590
having worked with security researchers

34
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:34,270
and security teams in the past I found

35
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:36,149
that often security vulnerabilities get

36
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:38,649
discovered and found and aren't often

37
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:41,860
remediated with the speed and severity

38
00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:43,570
with the gravity that we as security

39
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:46,390
professionals would like them to have

40
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:48,100
and we also find that even though we

41
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:51,759
fund we discover a slew of these

42
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:54,759
behaviors or actions or even bugs they

43
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,950
keep repeating and that can be a very

44
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:59,770
frustrating and demotivating experience

45
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,600
if you're a security researcher so I

46
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:04,060
wanted to shed a little bit of light as

47
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,570
to why this happens and why this is part

48
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:09,369
of the human condition so what I'm going

49
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:12,400
to do in this talk is go through a

50
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:15,070
selection of biases and beliefs that we

51
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,560
as human beings have that can affect

52
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:19,120
these by no means is this the exhaustive

53
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,430
list that explains why we

54
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,400
insecurity it's just a selection of

55
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:26,530
several that I have picked up along the

56
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,330
way and found incredibly fascinating and

57
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:31,989
think it's relevant to just share with

58
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:34,660
this community so the first the first

59
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:39,819
thing I really wanted to tackle is the

60
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:42,370
belief of knowledge so when we in

61
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:45,730
security education space started the

62
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:48,370
field we we started with posters and

63
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:50,290
videos said well if I it must be that

64
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,030
people don't know and if I'm tell them

65
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,890
they tell them about the severity of the

66
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:56,019
bugs or tell them about the fishing best

67
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:59,828
practices they'll change their behavior

68
00:02:56,019 --> 00:03:01,540
right unfortunately facts and knowing

69
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:03,670
the facts is not enough for us to shift

70
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:06,489
and one of my favorite illustrations of

71
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:08,559
this is the Shepherd's table example and

72
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:11,440
so if I asked everybody on this call

73
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,810
which table that in front of us is

74
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,609
longer you'll say oh that's a dumb

75
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,819
question Masha the green one is

76
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:21,129
obviously longer and yet when you see

77
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:23,339
them in practice you realize that their

78
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:27,069
DXM are actually exactly the same size

79
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,269
and this is an optical illusion now

80
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:31,149
that's cool

81
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:34,180
but when you go back to the exact same

82
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:36,220
example and you now know that the tables

83
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:39,579
are still this are the exact same size

84
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:42,220
your brain can still not see the fact

85
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:44,440
that the green table is longer so even

86
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,540
though you know that it is the same size

87
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,450
it doesn't change the fact that you

88
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:51,578
perceive it differently so this is where

89
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:56,200
the concept of biases and knowing our

90
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:58,840
biases come in we can see this as an

91
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:02,168
example of knowing is not enough in

92
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:06,190
password' practices lasted a cool survey

93
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:08,650
of a large portion their users and

94
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:11,290
population and found that a large

95
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:14,079
percentage of the population knows what

96
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,608
a secure password is and know it's

97
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:17,380
important and they understand the risk

98
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:19,418
of reusing it and you had a huge

99
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,789
percentage of them still choose an easy

100
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:23,590
password and reuse similar or the same

101
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:24,610
passwords are going forward so just

102
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,919
because you know it doesn't mean you're

103
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,390
going to do anything different one of

104
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:30,479
the reasons that this can be explained

105
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:33,068
is a bias called the superiority bias

106
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:37,539
that it won't happen to me

107
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:39,729
and they did a study in 1980s where they

108
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:41,529
surveyed thousands of drivers and asked

109
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:44,740
them if they thought that they were

110
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:47,710
going to be below average on an average

111
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,509
driver and above average driver and 93

112
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,460
percent of the respondents thought that

113
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:54,249
they were an above average driver and

114
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,549
responded and were excellent in risky

115
00:04:54,249 --> 00:04:59,409
conditions and at high speeds which

116
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,999
statistically is impossible so there's

117
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:05,469
definitely a percentage of those people

118
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:11,439
who had an unrealistic view of what that

119
00:05:05,469 --> 00:05:15,308
also looks like is use tough one while

120
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:17,289
driving but 91% also known that that's a

121
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:19,210
really dangerous practice we just

122
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:22,210
believe that that behavior doesn't apply

123
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:24,188
to us because we are superior we're just

124
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:27,698
more talented more capable than the

125
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:28,990
average human being and so this effect

126
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:30,879
won't actually get to us and so what

127
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,309
that looks like from security

128
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:35,979
perspective is yeah I don't necessarily

129
00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:37,599
to change my passwords because I'm not

130
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:39,699
that's not really ever gonna happen to

131
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:41,199
me or I can detect all the phishing

132
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:42,879
attacks and spear phishing that gets

133
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,300
into my inbox so I don't really need to

134
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:49,149
make sure my systems are up-to-date so

135
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:52,889
we choose that reckless behavior because

136
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:56,229
it may not we think it doesn't affect us

137
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:58,599
the next bias I wanted to highlight is

138
00:05:56,229 --> 00:06:03,279
through a story of the Columbia space

139
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:05,740
shuttle so in 2003 the Columbia broke up

140
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,719
and it's returned to Earth killing all

141
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:10,479
seven astronauts that were on board and

142
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:12,069
an investigation ensued after the fact

143
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,508
that discovered that there's a large

144
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:16,180
piece of foam that fell from the

145
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:17,830
shuttles external tank and it hit the

146
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,979
spacecraft of the wing so this is what

147
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:23,169
this image here shows the situation

148
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:26,080
though as it was beginning to get

149
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:29,620
investigated was that the foam issue is

150
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,659
actually known for years and when they

151
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:34,509
looked back they found that in almost

152
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:37,479
ten percent of other missions where they

153
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:40,360
could observe such a shedding it it did

154
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:42,878
happen and it did cause damage but in

155
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,519
all of those other cases it never hit a

156
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,660
critical part of the shuttle thereby not

157
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:49,110
causing cast

158
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:54,280
don't damage as it did in the Colombia's

159
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:57,580
situation and what started happening for

160
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:00,280
the engineers for these types of systems

161
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,469
is they began to see foam shedding as an

162
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,659
inevitable part of the procedure an

163
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:07,000
inevitable risk that they chose to

164
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:09,750
accept until it got to the point of a

165
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,080
critical failure so this became

166
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:15,220
understood as a near-miss bias I really

167
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,169
want to dive into this a little more

168
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:20,290
because I feel like this is particularly

169
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:21,070
applicable to security practices I'm

170
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:23,590
going to walk through a couple more

171
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:28,030
examples but before we go into those the

172
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:30,669
near-miss bias as a definition is seen

173
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:34,750
as when people systematically categorize

174
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:36,970
near-misses as successes especially when

175
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:39,220
luck intervenes to avert failure so they

176
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:41,740
attributed to skill one in fact it's

177
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:44,400
actually luck and they miss Esther and

178
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:46,930
this misattribute how much they

179
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:51,460
contributed versus just your probability

180
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:53,410
so recklessness ensues because they they

181
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,210
think they they have a say in the

182
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:57,790
outcome

183
00:07:54,210 --> 00:08:01,539
so NASA obviously having high stakes in

184
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:05,590
this did another study where they used a

185
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,910
Mars rover simulation and they asked a

186
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:09,099
handful of information business

187
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:11,230
management management business students

188
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,970
all who have background in statistics

189
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:15,520
and probabilities as nature of their

190
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,530
degrees to go through a simulation where

191
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,039
they had to navigate a Mars rover from

192
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:22,690
one crater to the other in each day the

193
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,430
participants were given a weather report

194
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:26,919
that would influence whether or not they

195
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:29,770
should stay or move given the chances of

196
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:32,650
failure for the wheel and what they

197
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:35,348
found was that those who decided to move

198
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:38,679
in questionable weather situations and

199
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:41,919
survived it were more likely to take a

200
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:43,000
riskier decision the next day even

201
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,310
though they were presented with the

202
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,160
process the probabilities of fresh every

203
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:50,290
single day they still incorporated the

204
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,310
previous successes into their decision

205
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:55,930
and so what this comes up as is the key

206
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:59,020
findings of the study and of other

207
00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:00,550
near-miss bias research is that people

208
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,400
tend to see events as

209
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:05,650
and not independent so I'm on a hot

210
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,730
streak so I must be lucky I'm

211
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:10,120
untouchable

212
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:12,940
even though every event is statistically

213
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,860
independent from the other and what they

214
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,140
also found is that people with near-miss

215
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:20,500
data tended to skew towards riskier

216
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:22,420
decisions than those without and they

217
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:26,230
found this to be specifically relevant

218
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:29,229
in evacuation so what they saw is that

219
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:31,420
if someone had survived a hurricane or

220
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:35,830
hurricane evacuation directive in the

221
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:37,240
past they were far more likely to take

222
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:40,870
their chances next time there was a

223
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,940
hurricane as opposed to someone who had

224
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:44,530
never experienced a hurricane or had

225
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,800
never had to get out of the Hurricanes

226
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:50,709
path so people who survived it thought

227
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,150
that they that they were luckier right

228
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:54,340
and so they didn't need to do it next

229
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:57,579
time even though obviously hurricane

230
00:09:54,340 --> 00:10:00,370
impacts don't tend to trend from one one

231
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:03,670
hurricane to the other so how does this

232
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:07,180
apply to security security practices so

233
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:10,660
as an organization as executive decision

234
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:13,390
makers owners of critical systems every

235
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:15,310
time we know about vulnerabilities we

236
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:16,090
have in our systems and then nothing

237
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:18,849
happens

238
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:21,250
we aren't breached there's not a loss of

239
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:23,230
data you need to feel that we're more

240
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:26,500
confident that we're not going to be

241
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:28,720
breached and that we're going to we're

242
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,390
doing enough to stay secure when in fact

243
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,380
it might be by sheer luck that we're

244
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:37,270
avoiding an incident and it's also worth

245
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:40,000
noting that if you're talking with

246
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:42,280
someone who has been your breach before

247
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,160
they're going to be much more responsive

248
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:47,350
to your findings and or if you're

249
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,300
talking to someone who has no

250
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:51,970
information in the past are starting new

251
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:54,910
and they they've never survived the list

252
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:56,890
of vulnerabilities for example as and

253
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:58,860
your worst response rate is going to be

254
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:01,390
from someone who would have to handle

255
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,980
vulnerabilities in the past with no

256
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:05,730
severe consequences because they feel

257
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:08,740
like it's not actually going to happen

258
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:12,400
so the next question that I wanted to

259
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:13,850
explore with you all today is the

260
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,430
concept of fear

261
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:19,370
fear shows up in the security industry

262
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:21,770
often thud so if your uncertainty doubt

263
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:24,380
it shows up a lot in our marketing of

264
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:26,000
our tools and technology and we use it a

265
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,740
lot in communications trying to shift

266
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,610
people's behavior we really want people

267
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:33,320
to to say oh like if I scare you you'll

268
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:36,740
do something about it I want to explore

269
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:38,930
the question of does this actually shift

270
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,730
people's behavior and would you know

271
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,949
there's been studies around this because

272
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,840
everything from health care to

273
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:47,480
politicians have tried to use this

274
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:51,110
tactic as well and what I wanted to show

275
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:53,750
you was this finding that said that in

276
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:57,200
fact fear does lead to attitude change

277
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:58,340
but up to a certain point I personally

278
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,580
am a little bit disappointed about this

279
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:03,890
I think over we overuse fear way too

280
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:06,170
much and I think we can do use a lot

281
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:07,870
more of positive reinforcement that's

282
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:10,819
probably the story for another time and

283
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:12,680
what I really what I found really

284
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,720
interesting is that a certain amount of

285
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:17,839
fear presented in the right information

286
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:21,020
right context can in fact lead to an

287
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:23,990
attitude change but too much too much

288
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:27,410
without clear path to hope or

289
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:30,530
remediation becomes overwhelming and we

290
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:32,270
disengage from this information so what

291
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:34,579
does good information look like how do

292
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:37,130
we use it effectively so there's three

293
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:40,250
key findings in fear messages the first

294
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:45,380
is you have a contained recommendation

295
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:46,490
for a one-time one-time use the second

296
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,380
thing is you actually have to highlight

297
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:51,020
the behavior the benefit of that

298
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:53,210
behavior change the last is you actually

299
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:55,430
have to provide an outcome something

300
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:57,500
that you want people to do to alleviate

301
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:59,540
this fear so in this example to the

302
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,340
right the fear that they're trying to

303
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:03,140
get to is brain damage

304
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,700
the specific thing that they want you to

305
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:09,199
do to avoid this threat is wear a helmet

306
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:12,230
right so it actually can be useful if

307
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,000
it's too much people could disengage and

308
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:15,530
say let's that's too big of a problem

309
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,150
and it's scary for me to think about

310
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:22,040
that what that looks like in security is

311
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:24,949
I put up two different messages that

312
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:27,530
I've seen in my own career in

313
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:29,360
communicating with executives

314
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:32,209
on how you get them to shift shift their

315
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,250
behaviors so you can say hey you're so

316
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:37,010
own you've probably had backdoors in

317
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:38,840
your systems for years it's going to

318
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:40,220
take forever to clean up your data is

319
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:43,250
probably already gone probably just make

320
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:46,010
sense to like the architect your whole

321
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:48,380
never from the beginning and like that's

322
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:50,360
yeah I mean that's fearful that might

323
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,710
actually be accurate but that doesn't

324
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,870
actually get to the outcome you want

325
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:56,330
when in fact if you can provide people

326
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:58,880
information specifically around what

327
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:03,610
they need to do and the impact of what

328
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:07,850
you ask is would be incredibly helpful

329
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:10,550
so as a sample this is you know we found

330
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:12,290
really critical vulnerabilities this is

331
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:16,849
the impact of those vulnerabilities and

332
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:18,140
if you if you solve all your P ones but

333
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:21,260
in the next week it will greatly improve

334
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:24,470
your security posture there's a little

335
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:31,120
bit of hope in there as opposed to just

336
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:33,470
the and end of the world conversation so

337
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,930
the last topic that I want to talk with

338
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:38,630
you through is the concept of perceived

339
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:41,000
threats so we as human beings are

340
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:43,730
trained to identify something as a

341
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,710
threat and take proper reaction we are

342
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:49,520
actually really good at responding

343
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:52,400
flight-or-fight response but the thing

344
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:56,240
is we don't always perceive things that

345
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,470
can do us harm as threats and so what I

346
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,260
want to walk through in the next few

347
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:02,390
minutes is just an understanding of what

348
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:05,270
does constitute in our brain as a threat

349
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:06,949
so if someone pointed a gun at us yeah

350
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:08,689
you'd react if there was a predator

351
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:11,330
coming up yeah what about a security

352
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:15,140
vulnerability why why do we not get all

353
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:18,290
worked up about so the reason we don't

354
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:21,740
is because we perceive threats if they

355
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:24,439
match one of four or or one of four

356
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:27,890
categories it could be a several reason

357
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:30,110
and instead of just one but there are

358
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:32,839
four ways that we can proceed a threat

359
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:36,530
if something is intentional if something

360
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:39,170
is immoral something is imminent or if

361
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:41,079
something is instantaneous I'm going to

362
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:44,279
go through an example of each of these

363
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:48,610
and not likely so if a threat is

364
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:51,189
intentional we are wired as a human

365
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:53,769
being to see and understand and try to

366
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:55,810
figure out what the other human beings

367
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:57,850
think and feel and why they're acting

368
00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:00,640
the way that they're acting and so what

369
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:02,980
constant looking for intention and we

370
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:06,310
are attracted to the belief that if

371
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:09,450
somebody has mal-intent towards us it is

372
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:11,619
a greater threat which is why we

373
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:14,430
overweight the risk of an underwear

374
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:16,420
bomber on an airplane and severely

375
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:19,479
underestimate the risk of influenza

376
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:23,229
which killed 80,000 people last year

377
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,910
alone so while both are risks one of

378
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:30,279
them is perceived as a threat in our

379
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:34,390
minds next is immoral right so if we are

380
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:36,010
wired by society to have rules for what

381
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:39,730
is right and wrong and if something

382
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:42,160
triggers the sense of wrongness in this

383
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:43,810
case if someone told us security

384
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,449
vulnerabilities was as severe as eating

385
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:48,339
puppies we would be up in arms tomorrow

386
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:52,510
about it right like no we can't eat

387
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:55,089
puppies that's not allowed and that that

388
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:57,270
violates our internal moral code and so

389
00:16:55,089 --> 00:17:00,490
we we are driven to action about that

390
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:05,829
security so really don't don't trigger

391
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:07,329
that for us imminence so a huge portion

392
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:11,459
of our brain is designed for us to

393
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:13,599
survive and we're designed to withstand

394
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:16,329
attacks that are coming at us

395
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:18,369
immediately in fact most of our brain is

396
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:20,770
just one big giant get out of the way

397
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:22,629
machine there's only a very small part

398
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:25,389
of it that's designed for future

399
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:29,350
planning and preserving yourself in the

400
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:32,020
future which is why we are so good at

401
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:35,320
responding to a baseball flying or

402
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:38,110
baseball bat flying at our face unless

403
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:40,570
you're on the phone obviously turn but

404
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:42,879
are so terrible at flossing so much so

405
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:45,070
that something like 26 percent of

406
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,780
surveyed Americans that even say they

407
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:53,020
floss and you know a subset of those are

408
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:55,000
lying so we were really good for solving

409
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:59,410
situations of problems that

410
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,690
are going to affect our next few moments

411
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:04,330
and and our plans tonight I'm not great

412
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:07,240
for for planning for avoiding things

413
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:10,199
that affect our week from now or a month

414
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:13,450
from now a year from now so long-term

415
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:16,090
not awesome and then the last thing is

416
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:18,010
instantaneous we have a hard time

417
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:22,330
perceiving threats that happen gradually

418
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:24,520
now if if you woke up tomorrow and all

419
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:29,169
of your luscious head of hair and this

420
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:31,720
was in this case was gone then you would

421
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:33,160
see this as a tragic incident and yet

422
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,450
that needed to be resolved and you're

423
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,940
going to escalate this try to find

424
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:38,620
medicine we as a society would say

425
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:41,290
there's an epidemic happening massive

426
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:43,989
hair loss happened overnight but because

427
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:46,810
it happened slowly over time one hair at

428
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:48,070
a time over years you don't see it as a

429
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:49,990
thought it doesn't register with the

430
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:53,230
same amount of severity and we grow

431
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:55,110
accustomed to it over time so if

432
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:58,300
something happens instantaneously

433
00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:01,209
totally different story than something

434
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:04,120
that happened gradually so if we look at

435
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:05,830
security incidents that do perceive

436
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:08,800
threats and why they've driven certain

437
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:11,770
actions and motivation is because some

438
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:14,919
of these do fall into a category and

439
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:17,889
when we present our findings or or

440
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,780
understand that we're working on a case

441
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:22,690
potentially that falls into the

442
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:24,399
categories that we do play it up for its

443
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:27,340
full potential

444
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,960
so intentionality if we can understand

445
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:31,000
that there's a threat actor behind it

446
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,980
who had mal-intent and this in this case

447
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,620
you know cozy bare fancy bear that

448
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:39,400
there's someone who's has the the

449
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:42,370
outcome of trying to do as harm will

450
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:45,720
drive greater action immorality if we

451
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:48,699
can tie it to a personal and individual

452
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:51,820
sense of pain like your grandmother

453
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:55,660
losing all of her identity and all of

454
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:58,300
her retirement account feels wrong and

455
00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:02,320
so again can drive greater action if

456
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:05,050
it's imminent if you see this this event

457
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,689
coming and like if you you won't survive

458
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:09,100
it if if you don't resolve it now

459
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:12,070
and you can't keep putting it off

460
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:14,110
because in this case y2k you know there

461
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:16,290
was a very specific date and that was

462
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:19,570
looming and it was coming down obviously

463
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:22,930
happen but action was driven because it

464
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:24,970
was it was coming and it was coming

465
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:29,470
regular and steadily with with a

466
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:32,470
specific date in mind and instantaneous

467
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:34,480
I think the reason why we do see a lot

468
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:38,440
of press and momentum around things I

469
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,900
expect or heartbleed is because it's not

470
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,280
like a gradual buildup of P ones in your

471
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,410
vault in your organization all the time

472
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,690
it's a criticality that happens

473
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:48,520
overnight it hits the press and it's so

474
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:55,980
severe that you have to shift all of

475
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:58,840
your resources to it immediately and I

476
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:01,180
that should things I currently have

477
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:04,240
steadily developed over time with

478
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:05,890
gradual findings a lot of people who've

479
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,750
taken a lot longer just hit rate

480
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,670
behavior in the space and it would have

481
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:12,700
taken

482
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:16,530
companies a lot more prodding than than

483
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:19,120
it did to start addressing this and so

484
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:20,379
as a final takeaway for this I want to

485
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,229
recap some of the things that we've

486
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,940
covered that first of all knowing people

487
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:26,530
knowing about security isn't enough to

488
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:30,010
change behavior so even though we tell

489
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:33,580
people the facts of their their systems

490
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:36,310
or their behaviors unfortunately we and

491
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:38,290
they are human beings and knowing facts

492
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:41,980
are not enough we're just not wired that

493
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:43,930
way we tend to be overly optimistic that

494
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:45,520
we are more capable than other people

495
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:48,990
and that bad things won't happen to us

496
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:51,010
because yes that we are more capable

497
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:54,490
whether or not that's true

498
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:55,720
statistical statistics show us that more

499
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:59,530
people think they're capable than they

500
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:01,270
actually are we find then the next

501
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:03,700
finding is that the more we avoid

502
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:07,000
failure by means of luck the riskier the

503
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:09,610
actions we take and the further we get

504
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,860
away from consequences of risky actions

505
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:18,790
the more likely a damaging and severe

506
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:20,560
incident can happen and the last one is

507
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,309
the majority of security issues don't

508
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,049
usually read

509
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:25,240
Esther is one of the four categories of

510
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:28,840
threats and thereby don't trigger the

511
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:32,379
appropriate response and if you are able

512
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:36,970
to showcase a threat in one of these

513
00:22:32,379 --> 00:22:38,889
categories you're more likely to evoke

514
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:42,879
the appropriate threat response that we

515
00:22:38,889 --> 00:22:46,080
often hoped for in security of the

516
00:22:42,879 --> 00:22:48,759
organizations that we that we work with

517
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,639
but that that is the end of my

518
