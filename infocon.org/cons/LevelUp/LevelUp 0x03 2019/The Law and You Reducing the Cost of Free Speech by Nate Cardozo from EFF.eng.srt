we're gonna jump right into the last

21
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:26,300
talk of track 2 we've got neat Cardozo

22
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:29,119
here from the ESF it's gonna talk about

23
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,800
the law and you thank you so much for

24
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,750
joining us Nate I really appreciate it

25
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,790
this is an important topic for all of us

26
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,890
in the community yeah take it away

27
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:39,440
thanks Nate yeah thank you for having me

28
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,450
the law and you reducing the cost of

29
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,340
free speech so I'm gonna talk about

30
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:45,350
vulnerability disclosure this is

31
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,110
something that I'm sure all of you who

32
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:49,700
are attending a bugcrowd

33
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:51,770
conference know at least something about

34
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,540
a lot of what I'm gonna say is probably

35
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:56,959
obvious and you're gonna say uh-huh all

36
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,549
right we already knew that but you're

37
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,530
gonna say it at different times from

38
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,239
each other so I think it's still worth I

39
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,830
think it's still worth reiterating the

40
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,890
obvious and hopefully you'll pick up a

41
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:09,350
little bit here that you wouldn't have

42
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,399
before so what are we going to talk

43
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:13,100
about today we're going to talk about

44
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:17,050
what uff is what our coders rights

45
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:20,090
project does the legal and policy

46
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:21,380
positions that we take as a part of the

47
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,540
electronic frontier foundation to

48
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,910
support coordinate rights but mostly I'm

49
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,950
going to give you practical advice both

50
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:30,590
in terms of how to conduct research at

51
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:34,070
the outset to make disclosure easier

52
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:35,720
later on and then once we've decided

53
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:37,640
that disclosure is a route that we're

54
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:41,830
gonna go down I'll give you some do's

55
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:43,720
and don'ts for vulnerability disclosure

56
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:47,120
the Electronic Frontier Foundation

57
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:50,120
founded in 1990 is the oldest and

58
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,700
biggest NGO defending civil liberties in

59
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,390
the digital world we do free speech

60
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:59,839
privacy and innovation our biggest tool

61
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:02,570
is impact litigation we take people to

62
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,880
court to either make the law better or

63
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,650
keep it from getting worse we also do

64
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,540
policy analysis

65
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:11,480
I've gone up to Capitol Hill to lobby

66
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,400
about computer hacking laws and we do

67
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,269
grassroots activism and Technology

68
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,130
Development we brought you the world's

69
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:21,649
first and now biggest totally free

70
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:24,260
certificate authority let's encrypt and

71
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:27,948
we have a whole floor full of activists

72
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:30,520
whose full time job is to help you tell

73
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:34,880
the policy makers and people in power

74
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:38,030
what you want them to do not just what

75
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:41,180
the well-funded corporate types want

76
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:44,150
them to do as part of that the coders

77
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:48,050
Rights Project has been around for two

78
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:49,580
decades now and it's had a number of

79
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:52,130
lawyers working throughout the years

80
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:55,700
currently it's myself meet Cardozo our

81
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:58,250
general counsel who's Kurt Opsahl andrew

82
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:02,270
crocker Jaimie Williams and Stephanie La

83
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:04,190
Cumbre and we help coders security

84
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:07,070
researchers developers hackers you name

85
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:09,110
it at all stages of their research we

86
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,580
love it when folks come to us and say

87
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,860
hey I'm thinking about doing some

88
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,719
research how can I do it legally we

89
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,729
don't love it quite as much when folks

90
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,830
come to us and say here's all this

91
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:20,539
research I did I know it was extremely

92
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,200
illegal how do I present it without

93
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:24,050
getting in trouble

94
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:27,190
but we're happy to help people in either

95
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:30,410
of those buckets or anywhere in between

96
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:32,450
and you know the the reason that this

97
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:35,150
project is necessary is really

98
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:37,550
unfortunate in and that's that too many

99
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:40,940
legitimate researchers face legal

100
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:44,120
challenges that present that prevent or

101
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,889
inhibit their work this could be visits

102
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:50,419
from your not-so-friendly local FBI

103
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:54,070
agent to export control regulations to

104
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:57,560
NDA's to EULA's you name it

105
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:59,450
vulnerability disclosure as I'm sure you

106
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,099
all know security research does depend

107
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:04,460
on the free flow of information and the

108
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:05,810
uninhibited exchange of ideas and the

109
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,810
First Amendment here in the United

110
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:12,169
States gives us a right to disclosure

111
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:14,870
including proof of concept code this is

112
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:18,080
pretty pretty well sold in the law um

113
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:20,090
it's - despite the fact that it's seems

114
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,180
like a pretty

115
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,320
a absolute statement that the First

116
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,510
Amendment protects your right to

117
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,419
disclose it really does it really does

118
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:32,150
protect the right to disclosure that

119
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:33,919
said you can still get in trouble for

120
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:37,489
disclosure not through the act itself

121
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:42,710
but more commonly because the the

122
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:44,660
process of disclosure ends up giving

123
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,400
proof to the wrong people that you did

124
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:49,540
the wrong things and so that's what

125
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:53,299
we're gonna try and guard against today

126
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:56,960
code is speech so when I said on the

127
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:58,550
last slide that that disclosure is his

128
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,590
first time in protected activity that's

129
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:07,970
true even for a proof of concept back in

130
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:10,460
the early 1990s code was not generally

131
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:13,190
considered free speech dan Bernstein

132
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,659
then a grad student at University of

133
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:18,050
California at Berkeley came into our

134
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:20,810
office wanting to publish an encryption

135
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:23,180
algorithm online he had gone to the

136
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:25,010
State Department which administered the

137
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:29,389
export regulations and applied for

138
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:31,400
permission and he was denied and so we

139
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:33,530
went to court for him PFF represented

140
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,419
Dan Bernstein all the way up to the

141
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:37,460
Ninth Circuit and we got a really great

142
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:43,070
case which is now known as the Bernstein

143
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:46,039
case which really pretty solidly makes

144
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:47,930
it clear that under US constitutional

145
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:52,010
law code is speech and is fully

146
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:54,500
protected article 13 of the American

147
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:57,500
Convention is even stronger information

148
00:07:54,500 --> 00:08:00,410
and ideas of all kinds through any

149
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,750
medium of one's choice so code is speech

150
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:06,370
not just in the United States but in the

151
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:08,690
in the entirety of the Americas from

152
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:10,970
Chile and Argentina to Canada and

153
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:12,530
everything in between the situation in

154
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:14,960
Europe and Australia a little bit

155
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:18,320
different but luckily I'm a u.s. lawyer

156
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,479
and I most of you are probably in the

157
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,820
United States and most of the companies

158
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,090
to whom you're going to be disclosing

159
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:29,990
are probably in the United States so the

160
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:32,270
goals of the coders rights project are

161
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,070
to protect disclosure pen testing tools

162
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:38,360
proof the concept

163
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:41,659
so that's a real practical goal of ours

164
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:44,960
then the sort of bigger less practical

165
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:48,080
more ideological goals are to discourage

166
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:50,330
governments from enacting overly broad

167
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,210
anti hacking laws the Computer Fraud and

168
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:55,460
Abuse Act here in the United States was

169
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:57,830
written in nineteen eighty six the way

170
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:00,080
that computers look and operate and the

171
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:03,140
way that the network acts are utterly

172
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:06,200
different today than they were thirty

173
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:08,360
years ago when the CFAA the Computer

174
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,480
Fraud and Abuse Act was passed and so we

175
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,100
want to discourage other countries and

176
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,920
other states within the United States

177
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:20,330
from enacting overly broad laws because

178
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:22,339
we've seen what the CFAA has done and

179
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:24,200
then finally we we work to ensure that

180
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:26,360
penalties for computer crimes are in

181
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,060
line with similar crimes in the real

182
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,950
world currently this is not the case and

183
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:33,650
we're hoping to try and make it more so

184
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:36,830
an example here is Matthew Keyes

185
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:39,920
Matthew Keyes was charged with helping

186
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:42,589
someone else to face a single-page on

187
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,670
the Los Angeles Times website

188
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:48,740
it remains defaced for about 45 minutes

189
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:51,760
and he got 16 months in federal prison

190
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:56,150
for that that's ridiculous

191
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:59,150
practical protections the reason that

192
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:02,060
you don't want to be a test case and you

193
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:05,270
don't want AFF to ever have to represent

194
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:08,479
you is because being hauled in front of

195
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:10,189
a judge is extremely painful especially

196
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,950
because judges and prosecutors are

197
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:16,430
largely extremely unsophisticated there

198
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:22,459
are counter examples here we saw a judge

199
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:24,439
in San Francisco learn Java to rule on

200
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:27,020
the Oracle versus Google copyright case

201
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:30,770
but he is the exception when he tell you

202
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:32,240
not the role so what this talk isn't so

203
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:34,430
I'm not gonna preach to you about how

204
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,880
you should disclose I'm not gonna give

205
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:39,949
you a one-size-fits-all approach and I'm

206
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,320
not gonna give you legal advice I am a

207
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:44,990
lawyer but I'm not your lawyer I will

208
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,420
take questions at the end I would I will

209
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:49,069
I would love questions at the end

210
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:52,969
but I'm not going to give you specific

211
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:57,529
legal advice that's that's specific to

212
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:59,779
your situation research okay so let's

213
00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:01,489
let's start at the beginning you're

214
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:03,319
starting at the beginning what can you

215
00:11:01,489 --> 00:11:06,589
do to be better positioned for

216
00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:09,679
disclosure later get ahead of the game

217
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:10,399
if you can do it on your own stuff on

218
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:12,110
your own

219
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,739
equipment on your own account on your

220
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:18,439
own network please do it is a lot easier

221
00:11:15,739 --> 00:11:22,339
to defend security research when they

222
00:11:18,439 --> 00:11:24,110
did it on their own stuff is the target

223
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:25,939
of your research sitting behind in terms

224
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:29,569
of service or an end-user License

225
00:11:25,939 --> 00:11:31,670
Agreement a tosser a EULA if it is

226
00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:34,998
behind one of those is there a way you

227
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:37,639
can get it without agreeing to that toss

228
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:42,290
or you love is it downloadable from

229
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:44,809
somewhere else can you buy it used if so

230
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:47,738
that might be a great way of never being

231
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:49,610
bound by the pesky toss or you love

232
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:51,709
remember at the beginning when I said

233
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,980
that disclosure vulnerability disclosure

234
00:11:51,709 --> 00:11:57,378
is First Amendment protected activity

235
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:59,509
that's absolutely true but by disclosing

236
00:11:57,379 --> 00:12:01,220
a vulnerability that you had to have

237
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:03,799
reverse-engineered something that you

238
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,389
agreed not to reverse-engineer for

239
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:07,639
instance in a Terms of Service or an

240
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:10,850
end-user License Agreement you might be

241
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:12,919
incriminating yourself obviously look

242
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:16,399
for bug bounty programs if a bug bounty

243
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:18,470
program exists read the terms of that

244
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,829
program before you start your research

245
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:26,629
not after and then consider the optics

246
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:28,699
of the research are you researching you

247
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:31,699
know voting security in Georgia you

248
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:33,339
might want to think about the Secretary

249
00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:36,349
of State as part of your threat model

250
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:39,049
are you researching medical devices you

251
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:43,480
might want to be extremely clear that

252
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:47,149
you did not test this in the real world

253
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:50,299
okay now you found a vault what do you

254
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:53,019
do well it depends what's your goal is

255
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:56,539
your gold merely to get the thing fixed

256
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:58,639
is your goal to publish or present about

257
00:12:56,539 --> 00:13:00,079
your research or about the vulnerability

258
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,370
or about the process of finding the

259
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,410
vulnerability

260
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:06,560
is your intent to get famous so your

261
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:11,149
intend to get paid all of those will

262
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:13,329
have will make your the process of

263
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:15,949
disclosure different for you

264
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:19,219
disclosure do so I'm gonna I'm going to

265
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:20,959
do some do's and don'ts here developers

266
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,600
are people too

267
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,969
computers are machines and software runs

268
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,879
on computers but the people who designed

269
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:31,579
them are still people and why do I say

270
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:33,819
this this is obvious I say this because

271
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:36,800
they're flawed just like the rest of us

272
00:13:33,819 --> 00:13:39,469
maybe their egos are too big maybe

273
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,689
they're not as good a developer as you

274
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:45,079
are and they're not able to see how your

275
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:48,769
stuff works but the ego thing I think is

276
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:52,008
the biggest - remember you found a place

277
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:56,629
where they up so what do you do

278
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:57,740
don't make them feel bad about it many

279
00:13:56,629 --> 00:14:00,290
of the problems that security

280
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:03,110
researchers that we in our practice as

281
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:06,639
lawyers have faced could have been

282
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:09,920
avoided if they had taken this to heart

283
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:12,620
and what do I mean by that remember that

284
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,139
it may be that the person who's reading

285
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:17,029
your vulnerability report is the person

286
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:19,189
whose fault the vulnerability was in the

287
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:23,170
first place don't try and make them feel

288
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:26,809
bad I think that's a good way of

289
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:28,729
sometimes even getting a vulnerability

290
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:30,829
report escalated to the lawyers and

291
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:33,680
that's the speaking as a lawyer that's

292
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:35,120
the last thing you want so remember do

293
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,128
your homework do they have a

294
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,649
vulnerability submission process if so

295
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:42,079
that should be your first step are they

296
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:45,160
on bugcrowd for instance what's the

297
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:48,349
company's history are we talking a big

298
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:52,790
sophisticated technology sector company

299
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:56,209
a Google or a Facebook or are we talking

300
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:58,670
someone who's only recently started to

301
00:14:56,209 --> 00:15:01,628
get into tech and might not even think

302
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:05,839
about a vulnerability disclosure program

303
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:10,990
a good example here not from anyone I

304
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:13,850
consult but Brinks be the safe company

305
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:14,700
that is a very old company with a very

306
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,970
long history

307
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:21,150
dedication to security and complete

308
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:24,000
novice level cybersecurity skills and

309
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:28,010
they had no idea what to do with the

310
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,860
first vulnerability report that they got

311
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:34,800
and then Google just do as much googling

312
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,900
as you can about the company to whom

313
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:41,099
you're about to disclose have they sued

314
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:43,670
security researchers before if so tread

315
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:48,750
very carefully that kind of thing

316
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:50,490
find it so so this slide depends on the

317
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,990
answer to the first question on the

318
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:54,560
previous slide being know do they have a

319
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:57,480
submission process if the answer is no

320
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:00,329
find a person find a real live human

321
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,490
being someone who developed the product

322
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:05,220
someone on the team who's responsible

323
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:07,320
for one security someone who with the

324
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,910
name security in their job title will be

325
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,160
able to understand what the you're

326
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:13,560
talking about

327
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:16,829
LinkedIn is your friend here it is often

328
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:20,400
not that hard to find an actual human

329
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:25,470
being to whom you can direct a owner

330
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:28,260
ability report and you got a this is

331
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:30,650
sometimes times when developed when

332
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:34,410
researchers fail to do their homework

333
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:38,579
and again LinkedIn can actually be your

334
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:40,620
friend I I feel weird telling people

335
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:43,140
that LinkedIn is a useful and good tool

336
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:48,060
but in this case LinkedIn is a useful

337
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:50,370
and good tool disclosure do first

338
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:54,260
contact will be your most important

339
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:58,500
contact so be friendly come in peace and

340
00:16:54,260 --> 00:17:00,420
do not don't belittle the company the

341
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,720
developer the vulnerability don't

342
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:06,300
oversell don't undersell but make your

343
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,339
intentions clear if you've already

344
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:12,149
decided to go down the ulnar ability

345
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:14,159
reporting pathway and then presumably

346
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:15,840
you want to get this thing fixed you

347
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,630
might also want money you might also

348
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:21,000
want to be able to present but make it

349
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:26,280
clear that your first goal is to get

350
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,880
this thing fixed how important is it is

351
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:31,030
this the sort of bone

352
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:34,540
ability that if published could lead

353
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:36,730
every Tesla in the world to have its

354
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,530
brakes applied at the same time right is

355
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:41,410
this a public safety matter or is it

356
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:43,030
simple nuisance you know is this a loan

357
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:45,160
that will make a hardened plant stop

358
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:47,530
working or is this a film that will make

359
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,900
a game console lose an hour of time

360
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:53,320
don't oversell or undersell your

361
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:56,080
research if you're working alone maybe

362
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,929
talk to someone talk to appear either

363
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,300
inside or outside your organization

364
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:03,780
about it to see if their assessment of

365
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:08,290
the vulnerability matches yours

366
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:12,970
disclosure don't do not threaten if your

367
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:15,940
first language is that of a threat to to

368
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:19,390
the company they're going to take it

369
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:22,030
poorly don't make a demand don't make an

370
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:25,210
ultimatum on first contact

371
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:28,570
you know project zero at Google can do a

372
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:32,470
hard 90-day deadline for all of their

373
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:33,850
bones really only because they're Google

374
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:36,970
and no one in their right mind is gonna

375
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:38,860
sue Google but you're not Google I mean

376
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:41,770
unless you are Google but in which face

377
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:45,370
you don't need my help so don't tell

378
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:47,139
them on the first contact that unless

379
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:49,689
it's fixed in 90 days I'm gonna go

380
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:53,860
public even if that's your plan don't

381
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:56,560
put it in that first email so you have

382
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:58,629
an if your first language is different

383
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:01,750
from the language of the developers be

384
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:04,180
even more careful don't demand

385
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:07,000
compensation or a job even if there's a

386
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:09,100
bug bounty program if there is a bug

387
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,800
bunny program certainly mention that in

388
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:15,040
your first communications but don't open

389
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:16,960
with the demand for cash offering help

390
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,790
is fine but making your help

391
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,640
contingent on anything else could lead

392
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:25,120
to problems why am I saying this you

393
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:27,760
want to avoid extortion searches you do

394
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,739
not want the company to be able to tell

395
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,910
tell a judge with a straight face that

396
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:37,030
they were being threatened by a hacker

397
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:41,059
we see that happen yeah with some

398
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:42,559
frequency also remember the folks

399
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:44,539
who are going to be reading the

400
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:47,480
vulnerability report that you wrote and

401
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:50,960
maybe even the folk who wrote it that

402
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,490
being you might have social skills that

403
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,320
are more comparable to the average

404
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:57,980
developer and less comparable to the

405
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:02,330
average customer support representative

406
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:04,970
we in our field are a a strange and

407
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:07,908
wonderful bunch of people and I love to

408
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:10,460
interact with hackers but I have a

409
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:11,480
decade of experience doing so and the

410
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:15,499
people to whom you're going to be

411
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:18,590
reporting might not don't offer to keep

412
00:20:15,499 --> 00:20:21,980
quiet in exchange for anything money or

413
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:24,860
otherwise that is blackmail

414
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:28,700
even if it's true that's not the way you

415
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:31,998
should phrase it and don't say too much

416
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:35,899
too soon for instance let's say you are

417
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:38,749
doing some some pen testing and you

418
00:20:35,899 --> 00:20:41,178
happens to get into an s3 storage

419
00:20:38,749 --> 00:20:44,059
container that had everything of value

420
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:46,909
that the company has ever come up with

421
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:49,549
it might not be the best idea to tell

422
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:51,169
them immediately the severity of

423
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:53,509
everything you've got certainly don't

424
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:58,340
hold it back once they ask but maybe

425
00:20:53,509 --> 00:21:02,389
don't lead with it okay and here's the

426
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:05,509
you might need a lawyer if slide DRM if

427
00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:07,998
you had to break DRM to do any part of

428
00:21:05,509 --> 00:21:09,529
your research you probably need to talk

429
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:11,450
to a lawyer

430
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:14,240
if you violated a nondisclosure

431
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:14,659
agreement if you violated a Terms of

432
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,549
Service

433
00:21:14,659 --> 00:21:19,009
if you violated an end-user license

434
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:22,789
agreement you probably need to talk to a

435
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:26,539
lawyer before disclosure if you gained

436
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:29,210
access to something non-public I bled

437
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:31,009
like if a client that I was advising

438
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:32,809
gained access to someone something not

439
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:34,429
in public I would want to talk it

440
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:36,678
through very carefully to avoid

441
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:40,779
admitting to a Computer Fraud and Abuse

442
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:43,759
Act violation as part of that disclosure

443
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:47,470
if you've got something from a less than

444
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:51,259
public source you know if you found this

445
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:54,380
way out on some tor hidden service if

446
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:56,600
you got this from an FTP

447
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:58,520
that you know that they didn't intend to

448
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:01,250
be public something like that if you got

449
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:03,410
this from a shadowy figure in a darkened

450
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:05,080
hallway in the middle of the night you

451
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:09,950
probably want to talk to a lawyer and

452
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:13,220
then the last and and most common if you

453
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:16,040
in in my practice as a as a coders

454
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:18,590
rights lawyer at EF F is you might need

455
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:22,159
a lawyer if your employer will be upset

456
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:25,850
a lot of you work in security and a lot

457
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:29,450
of you have jobs that overlap with your

458
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:32,149
own interests if your employer is if

459
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:35,360
your disclosure is going to make your

460
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:38,000
employer's business or life difficult

461
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:42,500
then talk it through with them first

462
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,270
especially if your residency status in

463
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:47,960
the United States depends on your

464
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:52,160
employment you do not want as has as

465
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:55,600
we've seen at def cons past the choice

466
00:22:52,160 --> 00:23:00,800
between giving your talk at Def Con and

467
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:04,370
remaining in the United States so let's

468
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:08,000
sort those out for 20 minutes before

469
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:11,659
you're talking Las Vegas no no

470
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,570
one-size-fits-all I don't agree with

471
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:17,360
Google's project 0 90-day for everything

472
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:19,850
um but you know that's their choice not

473
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,860
mine I think that every vulnerability is

474
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:22,879
different and there's a myriad of legal

475
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:26,050
issues that could get you in trouble

476
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:30,170
here you know you might have a contract

477
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:33,980
that a EULA or a toss or an NDA or

478
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:37,940
something there's all sorts of different

479
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:41,720
reasons why disclosure varies so so

480
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,380
greatly disclosure do get paid this

481
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,570
one's easy

482
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:47,510
if the company has a bug bounty program

483
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:50,060
use it if the company doesn't have a bug

484
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:52,850
bounty program they're probably not

485
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:56,540
gonna pay you and if I were you I

486
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:58,850
wouldn't demand money that could get you

487
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:01,899
into the extortion realm

488
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:04,389
pretty quickly unfortunately

489
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:07,240
but Bonnie don't this is from a few

490
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:08,620
years ago before no I guess Facebook

491
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,500
actually did have a book writing program

492
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:13,330
at this point so this is a boner ability

493
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:17,380
disclosure method which I don't

494
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:20,439
particularly advise this guy had tried

495
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:23,020
to disclose a method whereby you could

496
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:26,020
post to anyone's wall on Facebook even

497
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:28,030
malls that did not allow visitor posts I

498
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:30,970
guess this is still when we called it a

499
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:33,940
wall now there a profile and so the way

500
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:40,179
that this researcher decided to disclose

501
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:43,600
why was by posting on zux profile that

502
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:45,429
didn't go very well for him he ended up

503
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,689
he didn't go to jail and he didn't he

504
00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:52,150
didn't lose money or anything like that

505
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:53,890
but Facebook did cut him out of their

506
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:56,770
bug bounty program on what would have

507
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:59,290
otherwise qualified for quite a bit of

508
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:02,050
money because by posting on sucks page

509
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:07,120
he violated the terms of the bug bounty

510
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:09,850
program okay so what do you want to do

511
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,280
after the after disclosures done after

512
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:17,409
the vulnerability has been fixed what do

513
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:20,010
you want to do decide that before you

514
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:22,540
actually start the disclosure process

515
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:24,460
disclosure when you do want to publish

516
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:26,850
her present is a little bit different

517
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:31,570
than if you just want to get it fixed

518
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:36,309
why because it requires keeping the

519
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:39,129
vendor in in a happy place if if you're

520
00:25:36,309 --> 00:25:41,649
only if your only goal is to get a

521
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:43,120
vulnerability fixed the the vendor

522
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:46,390
doesn't have to love you at the end of

523
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:49,000
the process all they have to do is is

524
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:51,820
sort of you know groan and say that's a

525
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,559
you know okay well we'll fix it but if

526
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:55,178
you want to publisher present you need

527
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:57,460
to make sure that they don't just see

528
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:59,950
you at the point of disclosure but also

529
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:03,460
at the point of your publication or

530
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:06,150
presentation and so think about think

531
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:10,170
about that in in your initial

532
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:10,170
vulnerability report as well

533
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,020
you know here's some things that

534
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,330
obviously you might want to think about

535
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:21,740
if you disclose to them it might give

536
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,840
them an opportunity to fix the

537
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:27,080
vulnerability but it might also give

538
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:31,760
them the opportunity to try and stop

539
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:34,760
your presentation or publication so if

540
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:38,240
this isn't a phone that a vendor will be

541
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:40,970
able to pack at all then there is no

542
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:44,330
opportunity to fix it there is only an

543
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:48,130
opportunity to get them extremely pissed

544
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:48,129
off at you before publication

545
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:57,370
is too much this is very important free

546
00:26:54,580 --> 00:27:02,049
subway rides for life if anyone was at

547
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:04,178
Def Con what was this tough con 16 or

548
00:27:02,049 --> 00:27:06,789
DEFCON 17 quite a while ago at this

549
00:27:04,179 --> 00:27:08,350
point there was a talk or at least they

550
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:11,230
were supposed to be a talk from a bunch

551
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:14,649
of MIT kids and the talk was titled free

552
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:17,350
subway rides for life they titled that

553
00:27:14,649 --> 00:27:20,439
to get exposure to get press it's a

554
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:24,689
splashy title and it was so splashy that

555
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:28,419
the MTV a the Boston Metro sued them

556
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:30,700
because their talk was going to disclose

557
00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:34,440
a vulnerability in the fare card system

558
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:37,779
of the Boston Tea the Boston subway

559
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:39,549
Boston believed incorrectly that their

560
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:42,309
research was a violation of the Computer

561
00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:44,379
Fraud and Abuse Act and sought a late

562
00:27:42,309 --> 00:27:47,139
Friday night temporary restraining order

563
00:27:44,379 --> 00:27:49,389
from a state judge in Boston to restrain

564
00:27:47,139 --> 00:27:53,350
the students from giving their talk in

565
00:27:49,389 --> 00:27:56,199
Las Vegas we the ffs represented the

566
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:58,059
students we eventually won the tiara was

567
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,340
lifted but that was two weeks after

568
00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:03,970
DEFCON engine and they were not able to

569
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:06,309
give their talk it's possible at least

570
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:09,039
that none of that would have happened if

571
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:13,210
they had had a less provocative title

572
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:15,129
for their presentation think of how the

573
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:17,980
title or the abstract will read to all

574
00:28:15,129 --> 00:28:20,320
of your audience's your audience isn't

575
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:23,259
just the other hackers and security

576
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:26,039
researchers in the room it's also the

577
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:29,289
feds in the room it's also investors

578
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:31,389
it's also your employer are you really

579
00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:33,039
going to give step-by-step instructions

580
00:28:31,389 --> 00:28:36,789
on how to give subway free subway rides

581
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:38,499
for life the MIT kids weren't actually

582
00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:40,149
planning on giving instructions on how

583
00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:44,940
to get a free subway rights for life and

584
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:48,489
that was a tease in their title

585
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:50,409
disclosure do do release a Bruce proof

586
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:52,929
of concept if you want you don't have to

587
00:28:50,409 --> 00:28:55,330
that's enough for someone with your

588
00:28:52,929 --> 00:29:01,840
level of technical ability to understand

589
00:28:55,330 --> 00:29:03,659
the vol but don't give give a proof of

590
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:07,169
concept advanced enough

591
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:10,830
script kiddies to take and and run and

592
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:13,320
destroy the world with is I mean if

593
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:15,000
you're if you're the audience that

594
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:19,260
you're aiming for is script kiddies then

595
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:22,320
then certainly don't listen to anything

596
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:25,950
I have to say if your if your audience

597
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,540
is the academic crypto community they're

598
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:30,300
gonna want to see pseudocode but they

599
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:33,360
don't necessarily have to see a way to

600
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:38,090
actually extract a public key from an or

601
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:39,270
private key from an Amazon installation

602
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:40,620
yeah

603
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:42,629
don't release approve from concept that

604
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:44,070
the kiddies can run with there's better

605
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:47,010
ways of advancing the state of the art

606
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:48,300
that doesn't help anybody there's

607
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:52,430
resources available

608
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:55,290
yeah org slash coders info a tff ugh

609
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:57,300
Haley's full-time job Ellie Peterson our

610
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:59,730
wonderful intake coordinator her

611
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:03,570
full-time job is to read and answer

612
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:05,130
email from info Eddie IFFT org and she

613
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:07,290
sends a lot of them to me because a lot

614
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:09,000
of them are hackers just like you and

615
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:10,710
that's all I have

616
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,600
I think I'm five minutes short of where

617
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:16,550
I was supposed to be so if we have five

618
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,550
minutes of questions that'd be great

619
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:21,990
all right thanks so much for that night

620
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,830
this is this is Casey jumping on with

621
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:24,000
the tail end there

622
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:26,909
we're just gonna look through the

623
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:33,090
questions that have come in and see if

624
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:34,320
there's any this is a great exposition I

625
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:35,939
think you know the way that you walk

626
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,960
through you know the different issues

627
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,110
the different things would be able to

628
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,280
consider you know especially with

629
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:43,469
newcomers joining into the

630
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:45,270
bounty-hunting space and people have

631
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:46,620
done necessarily I thought the context

632
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:48,600
of people that have been involved in

633
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:50,580
vulnerability disclosure for many years

634
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:53,490
this is very very helpful as an overview

635
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:55,740
so thank you for that yeah my pleasure

636
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:57,300
see what we've got by work questions one

637
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:02,400
question I had for you is you know just

638
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:05,460
in terms of the kinds of cases you end

639
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,690
up getting involved in most frequently

640
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:09,690
that have to do with vulnerability of

641
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:11,910
research what's what's if there was one

642
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:14,880
single biggest mistake that you could

643
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:15,809
say that was made that precipitates more

644
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,090
of those

645
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:21,840
those representations than others what

646
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:26,699
would that bake you mind it would be a

647
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:28,799
researcher using what they think is

648
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:31,519
strong language and what the company

649
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:34,649
thinks is threatening language in a

650
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:38,159
vulnerably the number one we see it we

651
00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:40,649
see it all too often we see hey here's

652
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:43,739
this foam it's really stupid if you

653
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:46,320
don't fix it all tell Brian Krebs and

654
00:31:43,739 --> 00:31:48,899
your stock will lose half of its market

655
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,089
value so basically basically coming into

656
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:53,488
ha coming in too hot is is definitely

657
00:31:51,089 --> 00:31:57,809
the the biggest problem that that we

658
00:31:53,489 --> 00:32:00,960
encounter the other the other biggie is

659
00:31:57,809 --> 00:32:04,349
getting in trouble from your employer

660
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:07,049
like if you're if you do InfoSec for a

661
00:32:04,349 --> 00:32:11,129
living and you piss off one of your

662
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:12,570
employer's clients your employer is not

663
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:15,269
going to be happy with you so that's

664
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:17,939
another big one yeah sure

665
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:19,440
I was interested to see and this is

666
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:21,899
definitely been our experience you know

667
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:25,469
your call out to English is a second

668
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:27,418
language as a factor that the FBI the

669
00:32:25,469 --> 00:32:29,389
idea that people that don't speak

670
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:31,979
English as a first language it's not

671
00:32:29,389 --> 00:32:33,359
necessarily a function of how they

672
00:32:31,979 --> 00:32:35,159
operate or how they think of how they

673
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:36,029
behave it's just the language difference

674
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:38,059
they can actually cause the

675
00:32:36,029 --> 00:32:41,879
communication to come across more

676
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:44,999
absolutely here's here's a good one that

677
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:47,279
I think he'll appreciate Casey at least

678
00:32:44,999 --> 00:32:49,499
once a year we deal with someone trying

679
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:52,919
to report the exact same vulnerability

680
00:32:49,499 --> 00:32:56,159
which is hospitals putting PII on the

681
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:58,979
paper network ooh let's do this all the

682
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,909
time hospitals all over the world do it

683
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:03,239
all the time

684
00:32:59,909 --> 00:33:06,179
the problem is in the United States the

685
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:09,659
wiretap Act has a specific provision

686
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:13,559
making it illegal to sniff the pager

687
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:15,719
network so there is literally no way of

688
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:17,399
disclosing that vulnerability without

689
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:19,349
also just closing the fact that you

690
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:21,510
committed a felony yeah

691
00:33:19,349 --> 00:33:25,020
wow that's

692
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:27,400
no one gets complicated very quickly yes

693
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:29,200
you know one other question that's

694
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,820
that's floating around in here right now

695
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,500
we've actually got a viewing party going

696
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:34,960
on in the office and this came up as

697
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,010
we're going just you know with some of

698
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,610
the stuff that we're talking about

699
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:40,690
earlier on in the day around

700
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:43,030
standardization like safe harbor

701
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:46,270
different things that can be done at the

702
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:48,428
program on a level to create you know a

703
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:50,168
greater sense of bilateral safety

704
00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:52,289
between the hackers and the program

705
00:33:50,169 --> 00:33:54,700
owners I mean obviously you've you've

706
00:33:52,289 --> 00:33:56,169
seen some of that stuff and we've had a

707
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,630
couple of chats about it along the way

708
00:33:56,169 --> 00:34:01,450
but I'm interested to understand what

709
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:04,299
your thoughts are on how these these

710
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:06,340
kind of anti hacking laws which were

711
00:34:04,299 --> 00:34:09,040
created really before the concept of a

712
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:10,480
good-faith hacker how you expect to see

713
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,889
those change over the next period of

714
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:18,849
time know me and I know it's a deep hole

715
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:20,590
but that's the $64,000 question I you

716
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:22,629
know for the first time ever people are

717
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:24,490
talking seriously about putting a

718
00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:29,049
security research exemption into the

719
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:30,668
anti hacking laws I we we at uff have

720
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:33,369
always thought that that's a good idea

721
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:35,348
in principle but we would like to we

722
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:36,790
will reserve judgment before actually

723
00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:40,440
seeing what that exemption would look

724
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:44,109
like there are folks who are started to

725
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,909
to get exemption to get statutory

726
00:34:44,109 --> 00:34:49,270
language that looked even closer to let

727
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:50,859
something that we might like and as

728
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:52,359
countries around the world start to

729
00:34:50,859 --> 00:34:55,598
adopt anti hacking laws for the first

730
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:57,129
time we're leaning on them to include a

731
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,280
security research exemption or a

732
00:34:57,129 --> 00:35:03,670
good-faith security research exemption

733
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:05,170
in their laws so that's one the the

734
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:08,170
Department of Justice here in the u.s.

735
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:12,580
is pushing on botnets real hard they got

736
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:15,130
a rule change early last year late the

737
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:17,710
year before to give them slightly more

738
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:21,190
power around botnets but they're they

739
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:23,290
want more I'm making sure that when

740
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:25,869
those statutory changes go into effect

741
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:27,730
that they don't have unintended

742
00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:28,330
consequences is something that we're

743
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:31,490
looking at

744
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:34,640
yeah okay that's well that's interesting

745
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:37,549
yeah I mean the feedback that we've

746
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,589
gotten is similar the level of interest

747
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:42,290
in the level of awareness of the problem

748
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:45,490
amongst legislators both both here in

749
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:49,850
the US and abroad is steadily rising

750
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:51,259
this question we do instead as well as I

751
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:52,400
think the priority with all the other

752
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:58,880
things going on in the world right now

753
00:35:52,400 --> 00:36:00,050
is making you interesting yeah you know

754
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,530
one thing which we have to worry about

755
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:05,780
in the u.s. is export controls there's a

756
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:08,510
a multilateral Export Control regimes

757
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:10,730
called the foster arrangement that the

758
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:14,120
US has not incorporated the most recent

759
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:16,580
changes so that that will happen at some

760
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:19,100
point and the intrusion software is

761
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:21,529
included within that and so making sure

762
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:24,400
that the US doesn't screw up the whole

763
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:26,360
pen testing industry is gonna be key

764
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,550
which will be an interesting challenge

765
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:31,520
so one last question real quick before

766
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:34,010
we wrap up deriving from what someone's

767
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:38,570
just said in the chat just talking about

768
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:41,090
the idea of research performs in context

769
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:44,870
or even you know as a moonlighting thing

770
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:46,430
or a personal hobby of employment you

771
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:48,230
know something that we have we have seen

772
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:50,779
there was an example just given in the

773
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:53,330
chat we've actually seen this I mean

774
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:55,090
even internally with employees from

775
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:58,250
different companies with this idea of

776
00:36:55,090 --> 00:37:02,360
research being performs at the same time

777
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:04,460
it's working in a security role any of

778
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,900
those sorts of things where you know a

779
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:09,350
disclosure might potentially be

780
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:11,690
construed as as competitive or even you

781
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:13,880
know kind of damaging to the overall

782
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:17,630
mission of the company that the research

783
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:20,060
is employed by how does you know what do

784
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:21,650
you suggest in terms of you know people

785
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:23,330
that are feeling uncomfortable about

786
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:24,680
that how to actually resolve that gets

787
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:28,069
more comfortable they should be going

788
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:29,839
forward um surprise is your enemy here

789
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:32,060
you don't want your manager to be

790
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,850
surprised so making sure your manager

791
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:36,380
knows what you're doing I think is key

792
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:38,839
if your manager knows what you're doing

793
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:41,250
and your manager is okay with it that's

794
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,980
all it takes to cya at Lee

795
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:45,510
in my book I understand that you might

796
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,610
not be particularly comfortable telling

797
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:52,830
your manager about the the research that

798
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:56,550
you're doing on the side but if if you

799
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:58,620
want to the best way of keeping your job

800
00:37:56,550 --> 00:38:02,190
is to make sure that your manager

801
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:04,109
actually knows what you're doing yeah

802
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:06,030
that's good advice all right well thank

803
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:07,860
you so much Knight this is uh this is a

804
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:09,390
really critical issue as instead of

805
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:11,460
before on it so it's great to have you

806
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:12,629
on pocket the way that you have I expect

807
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:14,400
we'll be talking more about this

808
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:16,500
throughout the course of 2019 some of

809
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,980
the stuff that we want to see improve

810
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,810
out there as you know AFF does as well

811
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,670
in a ways has so thank you so much for

812
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:28,100
your time and we'll wrap it up there

813
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:28,100
thanks a lot Casey take her yes
