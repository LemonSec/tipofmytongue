1
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:13,350
thanks for having me

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,490
so I'm Joe gray we're gonna be talking

3
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,530
I'm sorry about that

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,369
from seat

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:22,070
to CVE basically I'm going to share my

6
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:25,550
thoughts on CTFs and where the value in

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:27,470
CTFs lie and then share with you a story

8
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:31,310
of how I actually got my first and

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:35,000
currently only CVE from working through

10
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:39,589
things so not dissimilar to what you may

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,129
see on bug bounties or just out in the

12
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:47,660
wild and have to coordinate so to get

13
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:49,790
started I'm the 2017 derbycon social

14
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,769
engineering capture-the-flag winner my

15
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:54,350
team got third place in the Oh cents ETF

16
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:57,290
at no lacan last year we're coming back

17
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:59,110
this year and we're out for blood I'm

18
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:02,600
the co-founder through the hacking glass

19
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:04,459
mentorship project we are working on

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,200
getting everything up and running for

21
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:08,330
that I'll talk more about that at the

22
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,390
end of the presentation I'm a Forbes

23
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:13,490
contributor and I'm in the process of

24
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:15,380
authoring despite my poor grammar that's

25
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,119
why we have editors of social

26
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:20,240
engineering and open book window start

27
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,119
to press and you may be aware of my blog

28
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,770
and now pretty much defunct podcast and

29
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,770
advanced persistent security net

30
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:33,190
on the topic of CTFs here's some stuff

31
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:34,720
from the Derby con se CTF I forgot to

32
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,970
put the picture of my black badge into

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,920
the slide deck but if you go looking on

34
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:41,220
Twitter especially with Derby con being

35
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:45,100
a hot topic right now I think Kate brew

36
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:48,820
shared a picture of it this is from NOLA

37
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:51,070
con the same thing so if you see the

38
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,380
password inspection agency about you'll

39
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:55,149
know who it is

40
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,429
so the objectives and flow of this

41
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:59,920
presentation basically I want to talk

42
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:02,500
about types of CTF where you might get

43
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,080
CTF s-- some of the common themes tools

44
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,730
of the trade and then of course there

45
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,880
are pros and cons you're going to have

46
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:13,660
some people who just have to be 1337 all

47
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:15,760
over everything and they they just there

48
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:19,000
is no CTF that's good enough for them or

49
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,609
you have people who on the opposite side

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,400
of the coin can absolutely step in and

51
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:26,190
demolish anyone in any CTF but can't

52
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,390
hack their way out of a wet paper bag

53
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:32,140
then we're going to talk about finding a

54
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:35,529
bug and responsible disclosure so OOP

55
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:38,920
sorry before we get started

56
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:41,580
quick definitions red team basically

57
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,260
that's the adversarial emulation team

58
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,959
basically they are posing as the bad

59
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:49,179
guys they may be the bad guy you may

60
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,680
have what I call an unauthorized pin

61
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,450
test or an unauthorized Red Team

62
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,650
engagement and that's where you're gonna

63
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,899
have people helping you out with that

64
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:58,720
that you don't necessarily want their

65
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:02,770
help blue team that's basically any

66
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,390
defensive body it could even get into

67
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,370
policy procedure and senior management

68
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:09,100
but some people say that maybe the green

69
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,750
team or the Gold team I don't really

70
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,730
want to get into more colored teams that

71
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,770
if I don't have to I mean at the end of

72
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:18,880
the day security as a whole we are

73
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:20,860
rainbow team like it or not and honestly

74
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,260
with red team I'm kind of against the

75
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:26,110
use of the term red team because at the

76
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:28,840
end of the day if you're not a criminal

77
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:31,090
and you're not doing something out of

78
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,510
malice you're going to produce a report

79
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:36,940
and turn it over to your client and they

80
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:39,399
are going to take action in theory I

81
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,990
understand some won't to actually

82
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,450
improve their security so

83
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:46,180
in fact you are posing as red but you're

84
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:48,070
really working on the blue team purple

85
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,080
team engagements that's any sort of

86
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,489
collaboration between red and blue it

87
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,840
may have a red team or sitting right

88
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,340
beside a blue team were working in a

89
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,130
sock and they're saying something to the

90
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:59,110
effect of okay I'm right at your web

91
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:01,150
server I found this cross-site scripting

92
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:03,550
bug I'm going to exploit it let me know

93
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,530
if you see anything and basically they

94
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:09,520
work through various attack scenarios to

95
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:11,590
determine what specific events or

96
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,650
behavior is observed during those types

97
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,870
of things getting into the hats white

98
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,300
hat black hat gray hat this is a

99
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,280
reference to the old cowboy movies where

100
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,040
the bad guys always wore black hats and

101
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:27,669
the good guys always wore white hats

102
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:30,100
basically that's the same with in

103
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:34,120
industry and then you have gray hats

104
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:35,440
which are typically someone who is good

105
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,130
most of the time who does some things

106
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,650
bad or vice-versa an example of some

107
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:44,170
gray hat activity may depending on your

108
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,789
views and opinions might be anonymous

109
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:48,100
whenever they decided they were going to

110
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:50,190
take on the KKK while what there was

111
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:54,630
what they were doing was it illegal

112
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:58,210
it was seen as for the greater good of

113
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:59,950
people then we've got red hat and blue

114
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:01,750
hat I put those as jokes red hat of

115
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:04,539
course is the Linux operating system and

116
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:08,310
blue hat is a Microsoft conference just

117
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:13,090
to keep going with all of the colors so

118
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:15,460
about CTF we have various types you may

119
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:19,049
have one that's self-contained in a

120
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:22,890
virtual machine or it may be a puzzle

121
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:26,260
think of this last year's Def Con badge

122
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:30,070
if you went and was able to link your

123
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:31,930
DEFCON badge with one of each of the

124
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:36,599
other types of DEFCON badges whether it

125
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:41,940
be goon speaker organizer or volunteer

126
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:45,120
press whatever it opened up other things

127
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:47,770
you could have a network or web-based

128
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,730
network king of the hill which is very

129
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:54,849
popular with Def Con 404 in Atlanta they

130
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:57,729
tend to run one I would say at least

131
00:05:54,849 --> 00:06:00,279
three to five times a year my personal

132
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:03,308
favorites social engineering capture the

133
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:04,719
flag and ascent capture the flag which

134
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:08,169
includes the missing-persons

135
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:09,729
CTF that out Robert sell and trace labs

136
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:11,709
runs I think they're getting ready to

137
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:13,869
run a global missing-persons CTF so if

138
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:15,610
you want to dig into the ocean that's a

139
00:06:13,869 --> 00:06:17,319
good place to do it

140
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:20,199
then you might have hackathons which

141
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:24,099
they're not really a CTF but sometimes

142
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:25,959
they are vacation you'll see a D Fair

143
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:29,459
digital forensics in incident response

144
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:32,050
CTF where you may be tasked with solving

145
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:35,459
memory forensics challenges disk

146
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:38,019
forensic challenges possibly even

147
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:39,459
network forensic stuff you may be tasked

148
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:40,990
with reverse engineering a piece of

149
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:42,909
malware and providing indicators of

150
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,360
compromise or they may just put you in

151
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:48,459
front of something like Splunk and say

152
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,990
have at it detect what's going on and

153
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:56,379
from that same vein pros vs. joes those

154
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:59,369
will include four teams two sets of pros

155
00:06:56,379 --> 00:07:03,639
and two sets of joes one red pro and one

156
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:05,559
red jo and one blue pro and one blue jo

157
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:07,930
and basically the two teams compete

158
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:10,990
against each other so the red pros will

159
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:12,819
attempt to compromise the blue jo the

160
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:15,879
red pros will compromise the blue joes

161
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:17,409
and vice-versa starting get very

162
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:20,469
confusing with that terminology but

163
00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:22,659
basically it's allowing people who don't

164
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:24,369
necessarily work in a sock or are not

165
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:27,360
necessarily a pen tester to be able to

166
00:07:24,369 --> 00:07:30,269
test their skill against someone who is

167
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,999
someone on the opposite side of the coin

168
00:07:30,269 --> 00:07:36,129
so where can you find Ct apps

169
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:39,699
conferences that's pretty common if you

170
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:42,309
win the DEFCON CTF you get a black badge

171
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:43,959
and that's applicable to the network CTF

172
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:48,639
as well as other ones like the social

173
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:51,339
engineering CTF as an example my derby

174
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,279
cod black badge which I hope another

175
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:56,769
conference picks up the black badge

176
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:59,289
thing from Derby con just kidding maybe

177
00:07:56,769 --> 00:08:02,949
not Voland hub is a good place hack the

178
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:05,199
box root me over the wire CTF 365 and

179
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:08,620
sometimes Google or other companies

180
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:12,130
Cisco Google whomever they may run a CT

181
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:16,000
your local DEFCON groups run at CTF open

182
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:19,060
stock has a CTF so for example I'm one

183
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,450
of the co-organizers of DC 865 and we

184
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:25,480
try to run one or two CTFs for the

185
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:28,420
chapter every year we also assist with

186
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:31,150
building the CTF for besides Knoxville

187
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,950
and last year a few of us actually put

188
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:35,110
together a CTF and went and helped out

189
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:38,220
the cybersecurity club at Montreat

190
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:41,500
College so lots of stuff with that

191
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:43,810
so commonalities you're probably gonna

192
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,370
find some garbage software on there and

193
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:46,540
I'm not saying that the software itself

194
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,160
is garbage but it's going to be

195
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,230
configured like garbage

196
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,270
very typically you might see WordPress

197
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:54,970
Drupal or Joomla because they're

198
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:56,829
relatively fast and easy to set up

199
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:59,860
they're not that uncommon in the real

200
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:01,150
world and if you know what you're doing

201
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,960
it's really not hard to blow through it

202
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:07,240
you typically find weak passwords unless

203
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,490
we're talking like the DEF CON password

204
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:13,510
hacking challenge you'll typically find

205
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:18,880
passwords included from places like the

206
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:22,630
John text file rokkyo Tex top500 poor

207
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:26,260
passwords file things like that you'll

208
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:27,850
find poor configurations which in the

209
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:30,939
real world you would think they aren't

210
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:32,860
really that bad but we'll we'll talk

211
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:37,330
about that later you might find

212
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:40,720
something where it allows you to allows

213
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:42,460
route login via secure shell or you have

214
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,600
a secure shell key but you're able to

215
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:49,930
also crack the password or it could be

216
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,820
something like comments in the source

217
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:54,729
code of a website that's something very

218
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:56,920
common and that actually paid dividends

219
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,270
in the cctf this last year for me

220
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,920
because I was able to find some fun

221
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:02,860
stuff that I'll tell you about a little

222
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:06,579
bit later you do commonly find in secure

223
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:08,230
protocols like FTP telnet the such I

224
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:11,920
would like to say that they you don't

225
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:13,470
see that in the wild but I mean the

226
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,000
protocols are still around for a reason

227
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:19,090
you'll typically see web applications

228
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,170
and then a lot of times especially when

229
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:22,390
you're dealing with something like hack

230
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:25,390
the box you'll see named one

231
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:26,590
he's like a dirty cow or kerberos or

232
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,830
something like that and they're

233
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:32,200
typically with those types of boxes and

234
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:33,700
I've not taken OSC P I have not taken

235
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,250
the pin testing with Cali course so I

236
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:39,040
can't speak directly to the labs there

237
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:41,140
but I've been told that the lab the

238
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,660
machine names in the lab are also kind

239
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:46,750
of hints at what you're actually after

240
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:48,550
which we could say doesn't happen in the

241
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:53,260
real world but then whenever you see a

242
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:55,620
host that will say is Acme org you know

243
00:10:53,260 --> 00:11:00,400
the domain would be Agni org and we see

244
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:01,570
ad 1 dot Acme org well that's a pretty

245
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,550
good guess that that's Active Directory

246
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:07,900
and we can do the same thing with

247
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:10,300
anything else there's quite often crypto

248
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,500
involved and that's going to eat up a

249
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,660
lot of people's time because a lot of

250
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:18,430
people aren't as familiar with crypto as

251
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:19,480
others so that that's always an option

252
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:21,910
as well

253
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:25,000
steganography you'll see that especially

254
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:26,650
in like forensic challenges but

255
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,480
occasionally you'll see it in a regular

256
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:30,430
CTF as well where someone's trying to

257
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,290
hide something like say a picture or

258
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:33,910
some text within a picture or something

259
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:37,240
to that nature

260
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:39,880
same thing with packet captures so

261
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,920
within these specialized CTF we

262
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,980
understand that with a conventional

263
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,860
network or VM based CTF that you're

264
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:53,350
basically trying to compromise that host

265
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:55,150
or series of hosts so in doing so we

266
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:58,060
have to look at it from a different lens

267
00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:00,490
for other types of CTF so with us with

268
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:03,790
an ocean CTF you may have predetermined

269
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:06,850
targets and most often you will and with

270
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:09,310
that for like Chris Silver's has sent

271
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,540
CTF he takes some volunteers from the

272
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:14,319
conference whether it be goons

273
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:16,839
volunteers speakers or other people and

274
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,380
he'll Colette he'll ask for I believe

275
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:23,650
about five to ten pieces of information

276
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:26,500
on each and then the teams just go and

277
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:28,480
they look for it and they submit the

278
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,930
flag but then they could also be

279
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,730
solicited for a link to that because

280
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:35,170
with the OSINT you know you're not

281
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,250
interacting with these people at all

282
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,990
you're basically

283
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:42,670
seeing what you can find on the internet

284
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:44,800
for free and then the sometimes you

285
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,969
collect flags on to companies and

286
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,510
sometimes the people of the company

287
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:52,120
within the SEC TF which you'll be for

288
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:54,580
that scenario about six to eight weeks

289
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,280
out from either Derby con or DEFCON the

290
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:59,860
competitors are selected because you do

291
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:02,140
have to apply for it and then you are

292
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,730
assigned a target company you have three

293
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:06,180
to four weeks to complete the initial

294
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:09,790
ascent phase and collect those 35 Flags

295
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:12,819
you produce a cohesive report and you

296
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:14,170
submit it for scoring and then the part

297
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,630
of the SEC tip that everybody knows

298
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,800
about would be the day of the event when

299
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:20,620
you're actually in the booth making

300
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,630
phone calls doing vishen to your target

301
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:25,240
company keep in mind you're not allowed

302
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:28,570
to make contact with anyone in the

303
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,220
company leading up to that you can call

304
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,600
to verify the number is live but that's

305
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:35,200
it

306
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,580
so with Osen CTF the Waker Silver's does

307
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,640
that everybody's looking for the same

308
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:42,160
exact flags on the same exact targets in

309
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,080
social engineering everybody's calling

310
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,480
it different times and they all have a

311
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:49,660
different target for example this last

312
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,990
year at DEFCON my SEC TF slot was

313
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:55,270
Saturday at 1:30 and that was Saturday

314
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:57,640
at 3:30 local time for my target company

315
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,960
so it was a lot harder for me to get

316
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,340
someone to answer the phone than the

317
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:04,210
people who were calling at the same time

318
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:06,880
on Friday the same perceived local time

319
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:10,150
to their target on Friday that's why I'm

320
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,980
happy to hear that for Def Con 27 the SE

321
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,390
CTF is going to be on Thursday Friday

322
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,970
it's gonna even the playing field a

323
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:17,439
little bit more deferred is like I said

324
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:20,530
you may conduct forensics and analysis

325
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,000
on files provide advice hacking in you

326
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:24,459
may be trying to reconstruct what's

327
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,800
going on build a timeline or anything

328
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:30,560
and same thing pro's and Joe's so

329
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,128
typical

330
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,229
of the trade of course there's Kali you

331
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:39,170
may decide to use parrot you might want

332
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:42,290
to use black arch you can use anything

333
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:44,300
really I know some essence ETFs like the

334
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:45,589
one snow ran at hack Quest last year the

335
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,889
winning team actually used their

336
00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:51,199
cellphones they didn't touch a computer

337
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:53,569
so tools that I've mentioned here all

338
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:56,660
these things are contained within Kali

339
00:14:53,569 --> 00:14:57,740
so if you use that you're good but there

340
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,990
are times that you don't want to use

341
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:03,499
Kali like for example when I'm doing

342
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:05,480
certain types of ascent leading into a

343
00:15:03,499 --> 00:15:06,019
social engineering engagement or capture

344
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,439
the flag

345
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:11,420
I have a VPS hanging out in the cloud

346
00:15:09,439 --> 00:15:14,089
that has all the tools that I want to

347
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:16,009
use on it and I connect from there and

348
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:18,230
the beautiful thing is actually have a

349
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:19,579
backup of that so I can actually use

350
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:22,069
once and destroy so don't have to worry

351
00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:23,569
about a cross contaminating ocean from

352
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:26,779
one company with ocean for another

353
00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:29,180
company but I'm also able to get a new

354
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:31,309
IP address every time and avoid getting

355
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,079
put in threat intelligence feeds if the

356
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:36,850
company is proactive enough to catch me

357
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:39,829
so with these WP scan that's a wordpress

358
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:42,949
scanning an enumeration tool you can use

359
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:43,878
it to even conduct password cracking

360
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:46,969
with it

361
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:48,889
burp sweep is probably one of the most

362
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:50,990
important ones in my opinion I would say

363
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:54,980
it and Wireshark are probably the two

364
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:58,189
most important on this screen burp suite

365
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:59,720
being a web proxy that you are able to

366
00:15:58,189 --> 00:16:02,269
funnel all your traffic through and

367
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:05,329
you're able to inspect the requests and

368
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:06,889
the fields associated with it

369
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:08,529
you'll see this the outcome of some of

370
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:11,870
the stuff from burp suite

371
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:12,800
whenever I talk about my CBE and for a

372
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,360
lot of the things that you would be

373
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,729
doing especially with like bugcrowd or

374
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:19,069
hacker one or another bug bounty type of

375
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:22,209
thing a lot of its going to be web-based

376
00:16:19,069 --> 00:16:25,519
of course there are some sometimes some

377
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:29,089
companies ask for analysis of their

378
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,290
Android application or an iOS

379
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:32,329
application or something and they'll

380
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:35,059
give you the source code or the apk and

381
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:38,599
then you use your integrated development

382
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:40,730
environment ide for that but for web

383
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,139
things burp suite is probably your best

384
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:44,420
friend

385
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:46,970
in map it's old

386
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,519
reliable network mapper it's gonna tell

387
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:51,050
you what ports and protocols are running

388
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:52,430
you can go a lot deeper than just port

389
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:54,589
scanning with it if you get into the in

390
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:57,290
map scripting engine then you can start

391
00:16:54,589 --> 00:17:00,380
dealing with things like ascertaining

392
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:02,959
the version of things and testing for

393
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:05,809
known vulnerabilities you can even write

394
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,609
your own so in some ways in map is

395
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:10,639
actually more like Metis plate than it

396
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:14,540
is like necess the next one is

397
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,100
Metasploit because of OS CP and the fact

398
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:18,949
you're only allowed to use Metasploit

399
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:21,198
once in OS CP through all of my

400
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:22,610
offensive research and whenever i'm

401
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,160
entering other people i try to encourage

402
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:27,619
them to avoid using Metasploit if at all

403
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:30,590
possible of course if you're doing this

404
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:33,559
in a professional environment and you

405
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:36,260
are allowed two hours of time to conduct

406
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:38,030
the test and write the report it may be

407
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:41,840
practical for your time to do that

408
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:44,090
Armitage which is the next logo second

409
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,309
from the left on the bottom

410
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:49,580
that's basically a GUI wrapper for

411
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:51,530
Metasploit Wireshark that's going to be

412
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:54,230
your packet sniffer you're going to be

413
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:57,770
able to look at unencrypted packets and

414
00:17:54,230 --> 00:18:01,600
gather data from that if it is encrypted

415
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:01,600
there are ways that you could

416
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:07,700
that information but it's a fairly

417
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:10,400
complicated process and above the above

418
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:13,310
the scope of what I'm looking to attain

419
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:18,650
with this in crack it's just like Medusa

420
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:20,210
or Hydra you can use it for on the wire

421
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:22,700
password cracking it's part of the in

422
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:24,290
map project in some ways it's more

423
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,930
efficient than the others in other ways

424
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:29,090
it's a little bit Klinker than the

425
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:32,120
others but it's still an alternative

426
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:34,129
that's worth worth it examining and

427
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:37,010
getting some familiarity with I

428
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:40,850
certainly I enjoy using it when

429
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:45,320
appropriate so about the whole argument

430
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:47,860
with the CTF not being realistic I'm not

431
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:51,159
gonna lie to you sometimes CTF sarn't

432
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:53,689
you may not encounter that same type of

433
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:55,010
format in the real world I mean when

434
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,380
you're when you're doing a professional

435
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:59,810
pin test the probability of you cracking

436
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:03,140
the domain admin password using me me

437
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:06,260
cats after exploiting eternal blue and

438
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:10,910
the password being flag curly braket

439
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:13,129
some punny phrase into curly bracket is

440
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:15,490
pretty low not saying that there aren't

441
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:17,510
domain admin passwords like that but

442
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:21,639
more than likely they're not going to be

443
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:22,929
that way but the thing is the

444
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:25,208
the concepts that you're putting out

445
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:29,139
there and the concepts that you're doing

446
00:19:25,209 --> 00:19:30,129
within CTFs they are effective in the

447
00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:32,199
real world because it's going to

448
00:19:30,129 --> 00:19:36,549
stimulate creativity if it hadn't been

449
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:40,679
for me doing CTF and looking at the

450
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:43,450
source of the websites that I was on

451
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:46,119
looking for hints and looking for other

452
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:49,659
websites to pivot to I would have never

453
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:53,199
found some stuff and right here is just

454
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:57,039
an example this is from the SE CTF so

455
00:19:53,200 --> 00:20:00,159
I'm not going to say who it is but what

456
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:02,649
we can see here and you guys are

457
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:04,629
actually an advantage as opposed to if

458
00:20:02,649 --> 00:20:06,309
this were presented at a conference in

459
00:20:04,629 --> 00:20:08,408
front of a large audience on a projector

460
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:09,459
because your screens are actually small

461
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:11,799
enough to where you can read what this

462
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:18,309
is talking about but basically what this

463
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:22,149
is is it's a hard-coded pop-up that's

464
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:27,519
giving the recipes for the username and

465
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:29,649
password of users so if I wanted to be a

466
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,599
quote-unquote employee of this company I

467
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:34,718
can go to LinkedIn find out who it is oh

468
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:36,759
they work in the office so okay I can

469
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:40,169
guess that and then okay there's how you

470
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:43,899
turn it oh I'm a shop employee okay well

471
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:46,749
if I want to call and fish them for this

472
00:20:43,899 --> 00:20:49,869
okay well I need to confirm your

473
00:20:46,749 --> 00:20:53,079
maintenance maintenance tech technician

474
00:20:49,869 --> 00:20:54,849
number and then all that stuff and then

475
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:59,139
it's not hard to get the other stuff but

476
00:20:54,849 --> 00:21:01,178
the point being that this is actually in

477
00:20:59,139 --> 00:21:03,849
the source code of this company's

478
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:07,179
website and as you can tell I've

479
00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:08,289
censored as much as I can tell out of

480
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:11,440
here

481
00:21:08,289 --> 00:21:13,559
but nevertheless this is just one

482
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,559
example

483
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:23,080
so some people say they're just too

484
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:26,870
vulnerable well you could be right

485
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:30,889
but anyone who has a Twitter account

486
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:32,418
anyone who follow us anything InfoSec or

487
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,080
honestly just watches the mainstream

488
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:36,799
news anymore

489
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:39,409
knows how often organizations are

490
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,030
breached and that tells us that

491
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:42,860
vulnerability management is lacking

492
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:45,799
because with almost every breach we can

493
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:49,969
see we we hear someone talking whether

494
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:51,530
it be Patrick gray or Troy hunt or any

495
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:55,580
of the people here or locally it could

496
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:58,610
be Graham clearly in the UK Brian Krebs

497
00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:00,770
I mean Jason Street used the term Brian

498
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:04,760
Krebs should not be your IDs I cannot

499
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:07,280
agree more but point being reading their

500
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,480
blogs or listening to their podcasts or

501
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,889
what-have-you

502
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,360
we can always get to the bottom of

503
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:13,610
things for the most part so like for

504
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,139
example the Equifax problem was because

505
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:18,110
of the struts vulnerability that had

506
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:20,059
been released and it was outside the

507
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:22,459
nine the 30-day window for getting it

508
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:25,940
patched so that was just one example and

509
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:30,440
the thing is when you're doing these

510
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:32,480
things we want to use the the idea that

511
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,240
when you hear when you hear hooves think

512
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,470
horses not zebras

513
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,750
of course unless you're on an African

514
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:41,900
safari then I would actually think is

515
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:44,240
eBrush not horses but nevertheless that

516
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:46,640
trains us to look for the most simple

517
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,840
solution because sometimes you just

518
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:53,360
don't have to go all out to get in

519
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:56,209
social engineering is an excellent

520
00:22:53,360 --> 00:23:00,080
example of why that is the case we don't

521
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:01,700
have to go nation-state off the bat so I

522
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,559
mean it might be cool to use some toys

523
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,750
like that use the fuzz bunch stuff but

524
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:08,780
if you can get in with Hydra or a phone

525
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:10,100
call to the CEOs admin assistant I mean

526
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,480
that's what that's what the malicious

527
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:15,439
actors are going to do that's what we

528
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:17,780
need to focus on so and I try to relate

529
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,280
this to the Zen of Python and if you

530
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,928
want to play with the Zen of Python just

531
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:24,260
open up a Python interpreter and type

532
00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:25,940
important this and basically what it

533
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:28,010
says as simple as better than complex

534
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,460
complex is better than complicated and

535
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:31,190
readable

536
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:33,110
counts so there's a lot more to it than

537
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:34,390
that but that's the excerpt that I find

538
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:37,459
to be most important with that so

539
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:38,870
there's no sense in being complicated if

540
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,640
you don't have to there's no sense in

541
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:43,750
being complex if you don't have to if a

542
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,850
simple solution will work use it

543
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:50,120
sometimes it is a gimmicky game but

544
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:52,250
again its creativity and novel ways to

545
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:55,429
attempt to attack or solve the problem

546
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:57,890
because there are these are not pin test

547
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:59,930
reports these are people learning new

548
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:02,420
ways to do things and while the

549
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:05,750
storyline for things may be silly the

550
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:09,800
experience you gather with it can be

551
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:13,760
second to none so some of the effective

552
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:15,980
uses of CTF concepts well of course

553
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,250
bug bounties that makes pretty good

554
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:21,920
sense when you say excuse me

555
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:23,720
security research which ties in with bug

556
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:30,950
bounties or other responsible disclosure

557
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:32,840
type things while Tavis Normandy is paid

558
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:36,470
by Google he does a lot of research for

559
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:38,659
other against other companies devices to

560
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:41,060
be honest if I was the point of contact

561
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:42,620
for a company and I saw an email that

562
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:46,850
come into my inbox from Tavis I would

563
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:48,800
probably have to run to the bathroom to

564
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:50,810
change my underpants cuz it probably

565
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:54,050
would be a good day for me I'd probably

566
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:56,659
be about on the same level as if Brian

567
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:59,659
Krebs called my PR department or my CSO

568
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:02,210
and that's the same question but the

569
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:05,060
same concepts apply in that type of

570
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:08,450
stuff as well as well as purple teaming

571
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:11,240
so with this you're trying to use the

572
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:13,130
concepts in the CTFs basically you can

573
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:16,910
think of

574
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:18,680
can think of bug bounties as an open CTF

575
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:21,050
basically a company has given these

576
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:23,360
people permission like if you are a

577
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:26,180
member of this website they have given

578
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,550
you permission to use their stuff as a

579
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:31,070
CTF in exchange for if you find anything

580
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:33,919
you tell them you may get kudos you may

581
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:35,389
get money you may go may get nothing but

582
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,340
at least if you're doing it through a

583
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:39,530
bug bounty website like bug crowd as

584
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:42,830
long as you follow the rules that are

585
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:47,240
strictly defined to a tee you probably

586
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:48,500
won't face any legal repercussions but

587
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,120
you're gonna try it you're gonna try to

588
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:54,080
do those same concepts to try to find

589
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:56,300
vulnerabilities I mean you probably have

590
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:59,720
you probably need some experience with

591
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:02,810
nmap burp suite some fuzzers you might

592
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:05,210
want to take some of the 101 level

593
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:07,399
courses and I'm not talking college 101

594
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:09,050
I'm just talking 101 level courses with

595
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,840
how to fuzz how to use burp suite

596
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:17,240
I know secure ideas has a $25 burp suite

597
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:20,389
course that you can do as well and map

598
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:24,380
same thing and guess what where can you

599
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:30,590
gain access to the experience in using

600
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:32,240
these things CTF and the thing is your

601
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:34,070
lack of knowledge about a company

602
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,790
because you're only going to know what

603
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:39,500
the company tells you on the website and

604
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:43,399
then whatever you go off and find on

605
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:45,830
your own and I honestly taking a page

606
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:47,480
from my friends who are far better pen

607
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:49,550
testers than I am taking a page from

608
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,650
their book they say that if at least 50%

609
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:54,860
of your pen test time is not doing Osen

610
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:56,240
you're probably doing it wrong for this

611
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,760
we're not necessarily trying to gain

612
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,490
that type of access but it still never

613
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:04,580
hurts to do some Osen on your target I

614
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:09,200
mean I think it was about two years ago

615
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:12,199
I collected a bounty for a company in

616
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,840
Asia who had left some of their

617
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,300
employees personal information out on

618
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,590
the web and it was a very small file as

619
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,540
a PDF I think there was like 12

620
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:22,850
employees impacted they paid me like a

621
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:25,250
hundred bucks so I knew nothing about

622
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:26,899
the company so I was doing Osen on the

623
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:28,460
company to see what I could find out too

624
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:30,290
how I can leverage my way in through

625
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:32,840
their website lo and behold I find a PDF

626
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:35,480
with this information in it so that's

627
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,000
you know that's something to expect

628
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,010
another thing to expect is that you

629
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,190
should expect to fail far more often

630
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:45,830
than you succeed and while I know that

631
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:52,190
especially in industry right now there's

632
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:53,810
a huge kind of idea that if you're a red

633
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:56,180
team or you just want to beat your chest

634
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:58,370
and talk about i pwned everything iPhone

635
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:00,890
you know cone cone cone and they never

636
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:03,439
want to talk about solutions well this

637
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:05,240
is an opportunity for you to actually

638
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,020
restore your faith in humanity because

639
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:10,700
you're trying to pone things that aren't

640
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:12,800
exactly potable with that being said

641
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:15,460
though if a company is doing a bug

642
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:17,780
bounty through something like bugcrowd

643
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:20,420
chances are they've already got amateur

644
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:21,740
security program so you're I mean unless

645
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,600
you kitchen on the first day or two

646
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:26,000
you're probably not going to find a

647
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,990
whole lot of low-hanging fruit you're

648
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,810
gonna have to work for your money and

649
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:32,270
that's why I just want you to be

650
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:34,250
prepared that to fail far more often

651
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:36,020
than you succeed and there's nothing

652
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:39,350
wrong with that I mean I I don't know

653
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:42,290
who the inspirational thinker is that

654
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:45,379
said it but if if you've never failed

655
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:47,389
you've never tried and I know Helio

656
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,080
Gracie one of the founders of Brazilian

657
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:50,120
Jujitsu

658
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,399
he says you either win or you learn and

659
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,379
quite free quite frequently I actually

660
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:58,880
learn far more than I win and that's

661
00:28:54,380 --> 00:29:00,260
okay so security research it's the same

662
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,840
as bug bounties but you might have a

663
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:04,670
different term a different scope you may

664
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:07,720
be doing your internal assets or you may

665
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:10,850
be doing your personal assets you may be

666
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:13,010
like me trying to take a certification

667
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:15,980
exam and you buy the device that they

668
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:17,200
tell you to set up for the lab and it

669
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:20,840
just so happens that it's vulnerable

670
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:24,770
that's just one example with purple

671
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:26,679
teaming same thing and the other thing

672
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:29,180
is especially if you're a small shop and

673
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:30,920
what I mean by that is you don't have a

674
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:34,730
dedicated red team or blue team you

675
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:37,190
literally have a security team if you

676
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:40,790
ever find yourself in a position where

677
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:44,030
you're not struggling to keep up and

678
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:46,670
gasping for air and you have

679
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:47,840
management's approval in writing even

680
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:49,900
though you're an internal employee I

681
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,899
still recommend getting it in writing

682
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:56,690
you could very easily ich depending on

683
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:58,520
how well you do your blue team job go

684
00:29:56,690 --> 00:30:01,940
off and attempt to exploit certain

685
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:03,800
things within your environment and then

686
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,900
because you know the exact timeframe you

687
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,770
can look back at your events assuming

688
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:10,850
you have a sim or some of their log

689
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:12,500
mechanism to be able to see what's going

690
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:14,959
on so you can determine what kind of

691
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:17,480
events would create what so you know if

692
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:21,770
you do a sequel injection on your

693
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:23,180
authentication database then you can

694
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,560
look at those events and if it's

695
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:28,000
successful you're going to get a lot

696
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:30,200
more out of it but it also allows

697
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,810
cross-training and innovation which is

698
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,920
very important that's one of those

699
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:36,290
things if I were going to gripe about

700
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:38,480
anything in industry right now I would

701
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:40,550
probably gripe about a lot of the blue

702
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,580
team has no desire to learn anything

703
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:45,879
about attacking anything or

704
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:49,790
methodologies they stick to the whole

705
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:51,590
idea of well you know you just do you

706
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:54,139
follow this framework you do these steps

707
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:57,800
and you know you're compliant so you're

708
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:59,930
good or they fall under the idea of I

709
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,580
don't need to know how to attack I just

710
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:03,710
need to be able to parse through my sim

711
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:06,230
and those ideas are somewhat correct but

712
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:08,000
at the same time we need to stay up to

713
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:09,890
speed on things and they may say well

714
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,510
you know I got this certification back

715
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:15,260
in the day and it tells me that you know

716
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:19,730
it's it's a skinning and reconnaissance

717
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:21,710
foot printing in opposite order and then

718
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:24,890
gaining access maintaining access

719
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:27,850
clearing tracks and reporting and yeah

720
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:31,490
that's true and I mean that process

721
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:34,669
while a gross generalization is correct

722
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:37,460
it's not always the idea of what's going

723
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:39,290
on and the other idea is that everybody

724
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:40,730
wants to get domain and then and beat

725
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:42,170
their chest about it well here's the

726
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:46,900
thing I can do just as much damage

727
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:46,900
without domain admin and not be detected

728
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:52,169
I can if I can get in install torque

729
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:54,269
change a password send an email to

730
00:31:52,169 --> 00:31:58,409
myself and install something I don't

731
00:31:54,269 --> 00:31:59,720
need domain admin no one does so you

732
00:31:58,409 --> 00:32:01,950
know getting away from that dichotomy

733
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:04,049
understanding what someone could do I

734
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:05,580
mean an example of a purple team

735
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:08,879
engagement you could do in the office on

736
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:11,369
Monday you could go and ask with a

737
00:32:08,879 --> 00:32:14,039
formal permission of course you could go

738
00:32:11,369 --> 00:32:16,590
and get so in HR to try to send things

739
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:18,600
to themselves and I mean you can

740
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:20,580
wherever you store your crown jewels if

741
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,639
this person has access to that create a

742
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:25,129
dummy file

743
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:28,820
I mean you know you have crown jewels

744
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:30,470
text create jewels crown text and make

745
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:32,178
sure that that's what's getting sent but

746
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:34,820
send it another thing is you can do to

747
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:36,440
assess that as well as write a

748
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,820
PowerShell or Python script to see if

749
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,039
you can encrypt a file if you can

750
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:40,939
encrypt a file using a script there's a

751
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:43,879
good chance you're about to be

752
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:45,070
susceptible to ransomware as well so

753
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,620
here's my story

754
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:50,120
basically I'm starting on OS WP which if

755
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:51,350
you're not aware is the offensive

756
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:54,439
security wireless professional

757
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:56,389
certification when you go to the web

758
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:59,029
site they tell you there are certain

759
00:32:56,389 --> 00:33:02,120
network cards they tell you to get I've

760
00:32:59,029 --> 00:33:05,649
got the 2.4 and the 5 gigahertz alpha

761
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:08,059
card and then they also tell you to get

762
00:33:05,649 --> 00:33:10,908
one of two routers because they are

763
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:13,668
injectable and there are security flaws

764
00:33:10,909 --> 00:33:16,000
with them this was I did check exploit

765
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:18,620
DB before I went down the rabbit hole

766
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,409
pursuing the CVE to verify that it

767
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:23,209
wasn't there and it was not so I had

768
00:33:21,409 --> 00:33:25,130
just finished a vole hub CTF I don't

769
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:29,389
remember which one it was but I had I

770
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:30,980
had my system configured for burb and I

771
00:33:29,389 --> 00:33:35,149
was like ok well you know I'm gonna

772
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:39,559
configure my router so whatever and from

773
00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:40,699
there I I logged in and I started seeing

774
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,379
thing and I was like ooh this is

775
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:44,840
interesting I'm going to take a look so

776
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:48,049
this is the router it is a d-link derp

777
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:50,480
601 it is one of the two that offensive

778
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:54,080
security asks that people get when doing

779
00:33:50,480 --> 00:34:00,110
the osw key hardware version a one

780
00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:01,490
firmware version 1.02 in pay so let's

781
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:03,740
think about what we do when we secure a

782
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:05,960
router we need to figure out what the

783
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:09,109
host name is do we want to broadcast the

784
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,369
SSID what is the SSID what kind of

785
00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:12,580
encryption do we want to here is do we

786
00:34:10,369 --> 00:34:15,129
want to set it on a specific channel

787
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:17,750
what what do we want to set for the key

788
00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:20,719
you know do we want to configure it over

789
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:22,609
wireless do we want to do that over HTTP

790
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:26,330
or HTTPS and I mean a lot of these

791
00:34:22,609 --> 00:34:30,239
things in terms of HTTP or HTTPS okay we

792
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:32,969
know we're we want to use HTTPS

793
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:34,888
we probably don't want to allow

794
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:36,598
configuration over wireless but for some

795
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:40,020
people and some organizations that fits

796
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:42,599
their threat model better encryption and

797
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:45,540
the key and broadcasting SSID same thing

798
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:46,950
we know that we should be using wpa2 we

799
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:51,058
know we should be using strong keys and

800
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:53,098
we know that we should I mean I if we go

801
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:55,440
by certain certifications we should not

802
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:56,639
be broadcasting the SSID but from what

803
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,140
I've learned taking the course

804
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,290
associated with this it really doesn't

805
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,290
matter

806
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:05,740
but nevertheless you may have some

807
00:35:02,619 --> 00:35:07,840
hardware an old computer you know you

808
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:12,430
might have a crotchety great-uncle who's

809
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:13,960
still using Windows 98 whose idea for

810
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:15,609
using it is because it's so old he

811
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:19,030
doesn't believe anybody will attack it

812
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:23,140
and it's got his entire finance stuff on

813
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:25,210
it from the 80s and the 90s and he uses

814
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:29,230
it because it's got a version of Quicken

815
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:31,840
that he likes so with a hose like that

816
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:34,260
you honestly might not even be aware use

817
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:37,180
wireless in fact you probably not but

818
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:40,600
with the system from that same era or a

819
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:43,060
little bit younger than that that type

820
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:45,580
of host it may not support anything but

821
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:47,470
wet it may not support anything but WPA

822
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:48,759
so that's something you've got to

823
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:52,660
consider because at the end of the day

824
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:55,840
an IT we especially in security we are

825
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:58,839
not the purveyors of no I know we've

826
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:00,970
kind of got that stigma about us but at

827
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:03,220
the end of the day we are enablers of

828
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:06,000
the business we are trying to do things

829
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:10,750
to enable the business to be more secure

830
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,730
so with that you know our get off that

831
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:13,990
soapbox and keep moving along but all

832
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:16,840
these things were configured over the

833
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:17,229
web interface so here's what I put

834
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,330
together

835
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:20,560
after I noticed something was up I was

836
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:22,960
like alright I'm gonna put some fake

837
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,880
date I'm not about to email d-link with

838
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,350
my super secure password that I created

839
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,290
it with my password manager and stuff

840
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:33,549
they don't they're not good enough they

841
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:36,609
don't deserve that but anyway basically

842
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:39,940
I named it wireless lab I broadcasted I

843
00:36:36,609 --> 00:36:43,090
went with wet that's what I said it to

844
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:49,619
channel Auto this router didn't allow an

845
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:54,130
HTTP option so that's how I set it up I

846
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:55,540
don't know well if I hadn't have given

847
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:57,760
episode I probably would have taken a

848
00:36:55,540 --> 00:37:01,150
massive drink of darker pepper or

849
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:03,310
something bubbly to create me to make me

850
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:06,010
expel air out my mouth so I can be

851
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:08,020
plenty about using the term burp but

852
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:09,609
nevertheless anyway here's here's what

853
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:11,170
we have for a password change and I've

854
00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:13,660
highlighted everything in red so there's

855
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:14,319
the IP address up at the top that's the

856
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,209
default Ike

857
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:19,808
and we see its tools underscore admin

858
00:37:16,209 --> 00:37:21,698
dot ASP and we see right here says admin

859
00:37:19,809 --> 00:37:23,680
password equals one two three test one

860
00:37:21,699 --> 00:37:26,920
two three test one more on that later

861
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:29,979
and then user password equals that which

862
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:32,109
is base 64 encoded at the bottom we can

863
00:37:29,979 --> 00:37:34,328
see right here where it says allow all

864
00:37:32,109 --> 00:37:36,400
for the filter so that part's not

865
00:37:34,329 --> 00:37:40,900
filtered and it's allowing a remote

866
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:46,269
management so I go to log back in cool

867
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:50,469
so there's those two boxes again okay

868
00:37:46,269 --> 00:37:52,779
what's going on with those well so I

869
00:37:50,469 --> 00:37:57,670
made a username and a password file and

870
00:37:52,779 --> 00:37:59,859
I base64 decoded them and let me just be

871
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:02,380
clear encoding is not encryption and

872
00:37:59,859 --> 00:38:04,058
hashing is not encryption I will say

873
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:06,999
hashing is probably more secure than

874
00:38:04,059 --> 00:38:10,119
encoding but there are more secure ways

875
00:38:06,999 --> 00:38:11,680
to handle authentication but remember I

876
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:13,930
said that the password I was using was

877
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:16,979
one two three test one two three test

878
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:21,879
one two three two and three is missing

879
00:38:16,979 --> 00:38:23,828
so what that's saying is that it only

880
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,420
allows the 15 character password it

881
00:38:23,829 --> 00:38:30,849
truncates anything after the fifteenth

882
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:33,130
character so what do we do well like I

883
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:36,459
said I went looking through exploit DB I

884
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:38,499
went doing some specialized Google

885
00:38:36,459 --> 00:38:40,749
searches basically the same type of

886
00:38:38,499 --> 00:38:44,109
searches I would do if I were running Oh

887
00:38:40,749 --> 00:38:47,379
sent four CVEs I looked at Metasploit D

888
00:38:44,109 --> 00:38:49,900
links website Google everywhere I can

889
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:52,479
think that look I look to see if anyone

890
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:56,109
else had identified and disclosed this

891
00:38:52,479 --> 00:38:57,968
and well no one had so I reached out to

892
00:38:56,109 --> 00:39:01,299
D link and William gets in contact with

893
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:05,199
me so basically his initial response was

894
00:39:01,299 --> 00:39:09,038
that you know it's a legacy product yet

895
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:10,390
it's true and that it's the land side of

896
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:13,749
the device it's not the internet-facing

897
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:18,519
side yep but he says that it's secured

898
00:39:13,749 --> 00:39:21,519
with encryption well I did responded and

899
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:23,560
said hey here's what I did but you know

900
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:24,850
saying that

901
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,080
just because it's on the land side

902
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:28,089
doesn't mean that it's not your concern

903
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:31,750
because you're not going to be able to

904
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:33,430
force someone to use encryption and you

905
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:35,740
know honestly it's not hard for someone

906
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:38,230
to run D off especially on something

907
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:40,529
like this to be able to recreate

908
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:43,270
something and be able to gain access so

909
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:45,130
he basically you know acknowledged that

910
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:46,600
it was a vulnerability and advised me

911
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:49,180
that stuff was end of life and no patch

912
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:52,690
was available I was like okay that's

913
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:54,460
fine I just wanted you to know he said

914
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:56,580
that I could disclose whenever I was

915
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:59,530
welcomed or whenever I wanted to and

916
00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:02,200
include the specific verbage in there

917
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:05,560
so great now where do I need to go to

918
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:07,480
look to get a CBE well Google is not

919
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,710
very helpful with this because when you

920
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:15,070
look at CV ease

921
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:17,800
you've got you've got CBE naming

922
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:20,290
Authority CAS and a lot of vendors are

923
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:24,550
their own seat CNAs like Apple for

924
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:26,590
example then you have cert who handles

925
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:28,630
some and then you have mitre who handles

926
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:30,880
others but I couldn't find a definitive

927
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:33,880
thing so basically I had to learn how

928
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,460
the process work I knew what I just

929
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:38,290
mentioned and I knew how to search

930
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:40,690
exploit DB to see if there was a proof

931
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:42,670
of concept on it so I reached out to the

932
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:43,720
DEF CON 404 mailing list in Atlanta

933
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:45,880
because I know there's a lot of

934
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:48,580
researchers there who actually make a

935
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:51,100
living from doing such types of

936
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:52,509
disclosure and one person said go

937
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:54,670
through mitre the other side and go

938
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:56,800
through cert typically I'm not one to

939
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:59,140
step down from a challenge but in this

940
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:04,750
case certain looked easier so I went

941
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:07,000
with cert so cert said cool story bro

942
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:08,020
but you need to go through mitre so I

943
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,380
did the mitre

944
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:13,240
write-up but the thing is with mitre to

945
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,780
get an actual CV you have to publish it

946
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,629
somewhere else

947
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:19,200
so I wasn't aware of we're aware of

948
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:22,090
where to do that so it's like mm-hmm

949
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:25,319
so I found in some places the full

950
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:28,240
disclosure mailing list there's the the

951
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:31,000
basically I've posted links to where I

952
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:33,100
posted everything for the specific CVE

953
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,080
but then I for some things aside from my

954
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:37,328
website these are the other places that

955
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,979
I put it so just to make sure that

956
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:41,469
one could say that I did not disclose it

957
00:41:38,979 --> 00:41:42,339
publicly I put it on the full disclosure

958
00:41:41,469 --> 00:41:44,529
mailing list

959
00:41:42,339 --> 00:41:47,859
I did a peer list post for it I posted

960
00:41:44,529 --> 00:41:51,039
it on my website github I think the only

961
00:41:47,859 --> 00:41:53,650
thing I really missed was Twitter but

962
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:56,319
nevertheless I did that and then I sent

963
00:41:53,650 --> 00:42:00,069
the information to mightor and here is

964
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:03,569
so this is the actual CBE its 2018

965
00:42:00,069 --> 00:42:07,029
- 1:06 41 this didn't really capture

966
00:42:03,569 --> 00:42:10,269
everything that's wrong with it but it

967
00:42:07,029 --> 00:42:11,950
captured enough and it was one of those

968
00:42:10,269 --> 00:42:15,729
things because the system is end of life

969
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:17,259
and because they're probably not going

970
00:42:15,729 --> 00:42:19,269
to put any fixes out for it I didn't

971
00:42:17,259 --> 00:42:20,680
feel that it was really necessary to

972
00:42:19,269 --> 00:42:27,519
argue back and forth with mitre and

973
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:29,410
create multiple CVEs or whatever so here

974
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:33,218
are my key key takeaways from this

975
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:35,109
curiosity and dumb luck go far that what

976
00:42:33,219 --> 00:42:38,109
what I ran into with that was dumb luck

977
00:42:35,109 --> 00:42:38,558
based on curiosity not all CTS are

978
00:42:38,109 --> 00:42:42,249
garbage

979
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:43,719
not all CTS are made of gold when you're

980
00:42:42,249 --> 00:42:45,459
doing these types of things whether it

981
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:47,859
be at CTF your own independent research

982
00:42:45,459 --> 00:42:49,779
a bug bounty or whatever you can make a

983
00:42:47,859 --> 00:42:51,069
difference in a product if you get an

984
00:42:49,779 --> 00:42:51,640
answer that doesn't make sense don't

985
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,229
accept it

986
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:59,499
continue to challenge it in a respectful

987
00:42:53,229 --> 00:43:03,069
manner so there is nothing formally

988
00:42:59,499 --> 00:43:06,038
defined to have something for disclosing

989
00:43:03,069 --> 00:43:07,150
anything but having a group of people

990
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:11,680
like Oh wasp

991
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:15,640
DEFCON groups city SEC slack channels is

992
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:18,729
c-squared aisaka I forget what the

993
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:21,269
CompTIA calls there's a ITP I think is

994
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:23,890
sa yeah yeah I Oh

995
00:43:21,269 --> 00:43:26,140
lotsa and all those having those at your

996
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:27,999
fingertips is invaluable because while

997
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,749
you may know more than some people on a

998
00:43:27,999 --> 00:43:30,430
given topic

999
00:43:28,749 --> 00:43:31,689
there's always someone in there that's

1000
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:34,930
going to know something thing you don't

1001
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:36,549
and whenever you're able to interact

1002
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:39,249
with those people you're going to pick

1003
00:43:36,549 --> 00:43:41,140
up on things that will make you a better

1004
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:43,718
professional but then whenever you come

1005
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:45,308
into issues like this you have someone

1006
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:47,140
to actually ask for help and as long as

1007
00:43:45,309 --> 00:43:49,809
you come in a humble manner and you're

1008
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:51,250
not trying to tone the world or you know

1009
00:43:49,809 --> 00:43:55,170
Doc's

1010
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:58,090
President Trump or something like that

1011
00:43:55,170 --> 00:44:01,990
most people will help you but I think

1012
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:04,500
today whether it be in school at work in

1013
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:06,759
one of these groups at a conference

1014
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:09,220
anywhere in life don't be afraid or

1015
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:11,950
intimidated to ask for help I respect

1016
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:14,529
people who ask for help a lot I hold

1017
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:17,259
them in the hole a lot higher regard

1018
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:19,599
than people who are too proud to ask for

1019
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,740
help because at the end of the day if

1020
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:22,060
someone asked me a question that I don't

1021
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:23,740
know the answer to I'll be the first to

1022
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:26,020
tell you I don't know I might give you

1023
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:27,669
I'll tell you that but I may follow it

1024
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:30,520
with if I had to make an educated guess

1025
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:32,080
here's what I would guess here's how to

1026
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:33,790
go about searching to find out the

1027
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:35,020
actual answer would you like me to get

1028
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:39,670
that answer and get back to you is the

1029
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:41,440
way I would go about it so through the

1030
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:44,020
hacking glasses basically we're looking

1031
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:47,650
to produce training resources and

1032
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:49,750
mentorship to people trying to advance

1033
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:52,330
in industry break into industry or

1034
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:55,440
change roles within industry we're

1035
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:58,259
looking at a five by five model five

1036
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:02,080
categories and five levels of difficulty

1037
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:05,619
which would be hardened attack monitor

1038
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:08,830
respond analyze and then the levels

1039
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:11,140
would be single system two to four

1040
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:13,660
systems three to five systems small

1041
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:16,690
office home office for three to five and

1042
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:19,629
then homogeneous enterprise and

1043
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:20,980
heterogeneous enterprise so there's a

1044
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:24,130
lot of building to be done with that we

1045
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:27,130
definitely need lots of mentors I think

1046
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:29,740
we're up to about twenty five mentors

1047
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:32,800
and about two hundred and eighty people

1048
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:35,080
on the list you can be a mentor and a

1049
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:38,140
mentee so just take a look at the

1050
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:41,230
Facebook or the Twitter for that so

1051
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:44,259
basically if we think about academia and

1052
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:45,940
certification there's some overlap but

1053
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,930
they both still lack in some places and

1054
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:50,560
we're trying to help fill in those

1055
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:52,750
blanks my future speaking engagements

1056
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:55,630
film one is going to be in any of these

1057
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:57,750
areas feel free to come say hi I'll be

1058
00:45:55,630 --> 00:46:00,550
at besides Tampa besides Huntsville

1059
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:04,000
insomniac in Geneva Switzerland

1060
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:04,930
besides Kansas City and hack in Paris I

1061
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,850
just kicked off

1062
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:09,339
I wasn't training this morning so I

1063
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:11,920
figured I'd give the attendees of this a

1064
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:13,720
coupon code so at the bottom it's a link

1065
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,930
to a two-hour OSINT training it's a

1066
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:18,759
basic post sent and a coupon code if

1067
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:22,950
anyone wants to sign up

1068
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:27,000
what's that being said any questions

1069
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:27,000
we've got about 10 minutes

1070
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:36,359
all righty let's see if we've got any

1071
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:38,460
questions coming in or let's see if

1072
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:39,900
we've got any questions I don't see

1073
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:42,270
anything on Twitter

1074
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:47,310
we'll see if anything comes in via

1075
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:49,079
twitch but a great job Joe really

1076
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:51,390
appreciate you going through this whole

1077
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:55,050
talk and giving us a good understanding

1078
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:57,629
of how to make progress and I really

1079
00:46:55,050 --> 00:47:00,119
appreciate what you said about asking

1080
00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:01,650
for help something that something I

1081
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:03,750
personally struggle with it can be hard

1082
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:05,609
especially when you know you're in a

1083
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:09,089
field or surrounded by really talented

1084
00:47:05,609 --> 00:47:10,650
people but as we've seen today a lot of

1085
00:47:09,089 --> 00:47:12,779
folks are willing to share what they've

1086
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:14,670
learned so that other people can have a

1087
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:16,290
leg up but not go through the same

1088
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:18,810
issues so it's something to keep in mind

1089
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:20,730
for sure absolutely

1090
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:22,828
I mean together we grow that's what it

1091
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:24,540
boils down to because I didn't come out

1092
00:47:22,829 --> 00:47:25,530
of the womb and know what I know just as

1093
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:28,079
you didn't come out of the womb knowing

1094
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:29,910
what you know I mean there are arguments

1095
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,800
which we won't get into philosophically

1096
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:32,910
that we've known all this stuff all

1097
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:36,990
along but we just had to have it

1098
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:38,940
unlocked but generally speaking you know

1099
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:42,060
we learned through interacting with

1100
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:44,880
others challenging ourselves and doing

1101
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:47,430
things that will make us grow and I

1102
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:51,089
think things like this are certainly a

1103
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:54,140
step in the right direction for that for

1104
00:47:51,089 --> 00:47:57,650
sure well let's see we've got a couple

1105
00:47:54,140 --> 00:48:03,390
things that just came in via the twitch

1106
00:47:57,650 --> 00:48:06,359
so we had a question from joy Kappa who

1107
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:11,460
asked on an average how much time do you

1108
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:14,310
invest in a week into finding bugs right

1109
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:16,740
now given that I'm producing training

1110
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:20,430
working a full-time job writing a book

1111
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:22,049
and writing for Forbes just in those off

1112
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:26,160
chances that I might find something I'll

1113
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:30,089
say 0.5 yeah in my in my heyday I would

1114
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:32,660
say probably between 10 and 15 on a

1115
00:48:30,089 --> 00:48:36,660
normal week all the way up to about 40

1116
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:38,069
outside of work on a heavy week it

1117
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:40,950
varies anyone who knows me could

1118
00:48:38,069 --> 00:48:42,610
probably attest that this is my passion

1119
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:44,830
my hobby and Mike

1120
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:47,260
so if I'm awake chances are I'm doing

1121
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:51,660
something security-related okay

1122
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:56,590
eat sleep hacking all right so our next

1123
00:48:51,660 --> 00:49:00,580
ha RSI question was from volton RS who

1124
00:48:56,590 --> 00:49:03,580
asked an interesting question kind of

1125
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:06,100
they asked for someone that has a CCNA

1126
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:08,380
what would be the next logical step to

1127
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:10,270
get into the security field if you have

1128
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:12,420
any kind of advice for folks out there

1129
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:15,730
that I have their Cisco Certified

1130
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:18,340
networking associate or some you know

1131
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:19,470
similar sort of a certificate or degree

1132
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:23,110
or whatever

1133
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:25,180
absolutely and honestly the the answer

1134
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:27,400
is pretty much yes there's no right or

1135
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:31,240
wrong answer for that it depends on what

1136
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:32,830
you are passionate about so if you have

1137
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:35,859
CCNA you may already have enough

1138
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:37,630
technical chops to go ahead and go

1139
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:39,790
straight for something like say o SC p

1140
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:43,570
or o SW P if you want to go into like

1141
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:45,160
hacking and pin testing but depending on

1142
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:47,650
your budget who you're working for and

1143
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:49,299
whatever you may need to may be

1144
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:51,490
worthwhile to go do certified ethical

1145
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:54,220
hacker and I mean I know that they catch

1146
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:55,720
a lot of crap for previous versions of

1147
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:58,480
the test and I'm not going to defend

1148
00:49:55,720 --> 00:50:00,370
previous versions of the test what I

1149
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:05,230
will say is right now I am actively

1150
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:07,960
enrolled in an online ceh course I'm

1151
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:10,660
working on completing it just because

1152
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:12,430
I've never done it and I'm also doing it

1153
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:16,029
because I want to teach the class at

1154
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:17,500
some point and I mean I'll disclose I do

1155
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:18,520
have a working relationship with

1156
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:20,830
ec-council

1157
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:24,280
I have social engineering training that

1158
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:26,380
I administer through ez Council but back

1159
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:29,230
to the question if you want to go more

1160
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:32,950
Blue team then it's going to be a little

1161
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:35,020
bit trickier I would say go to Chris

1162
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:37,569
Sanders org and take a look at some of

1163
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:41,080
his stuff he wrote practical packet

1164
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:44,200
analysis volumes 1 4 editions 1 through

1165
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:45,520
3 so he has a lot of stuff to help you

1166
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,799
out with that so that you can learn to

1167
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,300
pick apart things and work that way if

1168
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:52,210
you're trying to go like the route of

1169
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:53,890
soccer forensics but honestly the best

1170
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:56,539
thing I can tell you is follow your

1171
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:58,788
passion and

1172
00:50:56,539 --> 00:51:00,890
to quote system of the down stay smart

1173
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:03,650
and think dangerously that's about the

1174
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:05,960
best advice I could give you nice I

1175
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:08,930
didn't expect to a sewed a system of a

1176
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:11,690
down quote yeah I would suggest I

1177
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:13,460
actually I started I took I started

1178
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:16,339
taking CCNA classes when I was in high

1179
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:19,250
school and I feel like those that whole

1180
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:22,038
the you know experience just helps give

1181
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:24,380
you a great baseline understanding of

1182
00:51:22,039 --> 00:51:27,559
how the internet works and so I feel

1183
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:30,440
like a CCNA is a great you know platform

1184
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:32,539
to jump off into web hacking and all

1185
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,319
maybe API hacking all kinds of stuff cuz

1186
00:51:32,539 --> 00:51:34,940
you're just going to have a better

1187
00:51:33,319 --> 00:51:37,549
understanding of how the internet works

1188
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:39,170
and and you're you're gonna have an eye

1189
00:51:37,549 --> 00:51:40,839
for things that others might not have

1190
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:43,039
since they don't have that background

1191
00:51:40,839 --> 00:51:45,950
exactly because the only networking

1192
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:49,460
certification I have is a lifetime

1193
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:53,118
network plus that I got in like 2009 I

1194
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:57,829
think so you know I'm I'm not a heavy

1195
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:59,029
networking person my my background

1196
00:51:57,829 --> 00:52:00,799
before I got into security was I

1197
00:51:59,029 --> 00:52:01,970
actually navigated submarines and I'll

1198
00:52:00,799 --> 00:52:04,759
say that and people think I'm kidding

1199
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:07,270
but no I legitimately told the officer

1200
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:09,910
of the deck which way to steer the boat

1201
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:12,950
where we whenever we were going places

1202
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:14,118
so whenever I got out using my security

1203
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:17,538
clearance I went straight into an

1204
00:52:14,119 --> 00:52:19,609
InfoSec role where I basically was doing

1205
00:52:17,539 --> 00:52:21,829
GRC type stuff like helping a symbol

1206
00:52:19,609 --> 00:52:24,589
security documentation packages to

1207
00:52:21,829 --> 00:52:27,589
submit for an agency in the intelligence

1208
00:52:24,589 --> 00:52:29,900
community but then I stepped back from

1209
00:52:27,589 --> 00:52:32,569
security for about a year and worked as

1210
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:34,789
a senior UNIX admin administering hqx

1211
00:52:32,569 --> 00:52:36,770
and Red Hat because I think er with

1212
00:52:34,789 --> 00:52:39,950
clinics and stuff at home Illini taken

1213
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:42,589
some college classes on it so you know

1214
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:44,240
if networking is your background great

1215
00:52:42,589 --> 00:52:45,920
but don't let that discourage others

1216
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:48,649
that may have a system administration

1217
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:50,990
background as well because you know when

1218
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:53,240
when someone says you know oh you're a

1219
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:54,649
hacker I mean I live in eastern

1220
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:56,000
Tennessee I get jollies out of killing

1221
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:57,740
people on the hacker to see the look on

1222
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,819
their face and watch them trying to tell

1223
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:04,250
me I'm about to go to prison and once I

1224
00:53:01,819 --> 00:53:05,690
once I calm them down and understand get

1225
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:07,490
them to understand what a hacker really

1226
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:09,049
is I tell them hey you know what you

1227
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:09,618
know what a hacker is it just means I'm

1228
00:53:09,049 --> 00:53:12,079
a better sister

1229
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:13,279
madmen than you are I found your I found

1230
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:17,119
your flawless that's all it is it's all

1231
00:53:13,279 --> 00:53:19,009
based on logic so that's a gross

1232
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:24,769
generalization but that's certainly

1233
00:53:19,009 --> 00:53:28,339
something worth using for sure well I

1234
00:53:24,769 --> 00:53:31,279
think we addressed those few questions

1235
00:53:28,339 --> 00:53:34,759
that did come in via the twitch chat and

1236
00:53:31,279 --> 00:53:39,109
I don't see anything else on Twitter so

1237
00:53:34,759 --> 00:53:41,240
I think we're set Joe we had a lot of

1238
00:53:39,109 --> 00:53:44,058
really great feedback in the chat you

1239
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:46,399
know oh actually thanks and everything I

1240
00:53:44,059 --> 00:53:47,720
just got a question via DM but we're

1241
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:52,099
trying to get it out in the twitch

1242
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:53,569
channel but it didn't work so they

1243
00:53:52,099 --> 00:53:56,630
wondered about full-on man hours with

1244
00:53:53,569 --> 00:54:03,680
CTF CTF that proved helpful how long did

1245
00:53:56,630 --> 00:54:06,529
I invest as a noob I would say as many

1246
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:12,200
as four hours a day four to five days a

1247
00:54:06,529 --> 00:54:15,829
week as a noob for CTFs the full amount

1248
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:19,058
hours that proved helpful once you get I

1249
00:54:15,829 --> 00:54:21,739
I would say anything you get on Volm hub

1250
00:54:19,059 --> 00:54:23,779
is solid anything that you do on hack

1251
00:54:21,739 --> 00:54:25,400
the box is solid hack the box is going

1252
00:54:23,779 --> 00:54:27,920
to be pretty hard so I would say get

1253
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:29,509
comfortable with wall hub first but in

1254
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:32,180
terms of the man-hours associated with

1255
00:54:29,509 --> 00:54:35,210
it whatever time you can spare you can

1256
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:37,368
spare whatever you can't you know I've

1257
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:40,910
been fairly fortunate in a lot of my

1258
00:54:37,369 --> 00:54:43,369
roles that I have somewhat of a level of

1259
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:47,538
autonomy though that I can actually go

1260
00:54:43,369 --> 00:54:51,019
off and do CTF sand stuff so it varies

1261
00:54:47,539 --> 00:54:52,900
I know specifically for the SE CTF my

1262
00:54:51,019 --> 00:54:56,720
ocean phase over those three weeks

1263
00:54:52,900 --> 00:55:02,420
typically ranges between 55 and 80 hours

1264
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:04,069
in three weeks so but it just depends

1265
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:05,779
like if it's something that's not going

1266
00:55:04,069 --> 00:55:07,640
anywhere and I'm not time constrained

1267
00:55:05,779 --> 00:55:10,519
I'm probably not going to invest that

1268
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:13,359
I'm not going to put that time of time

1269
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:13,359
investment into it

1270
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:20,660
great I was there anything else that

1271
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:22,160
came in via DM is there anything I'm

1272
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:26,120
gonna check as well to see if I see

1273
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:29,839
anything else pop up I'm not seeing

1274
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:32,270
anything okay um well great again

1275
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:35,560
everyone who's watching live thank you

1276
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:35,560
so much for joining us
