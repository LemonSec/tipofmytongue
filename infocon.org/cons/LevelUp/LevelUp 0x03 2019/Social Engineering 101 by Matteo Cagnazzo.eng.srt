1
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:16,860
thank you very much for the introduction

2
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:22,800
Sam um yes I have a shot what the goals

3
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:27,479
of of an attacker of you are and yeah

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:30,539
how can we how can we achieve personal

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:36,300
contact with our potential victims and

6
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:40,950
yeah just talk a little bit so just a

7
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:44,300
really quick introduction about me and

8
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,770
the best faylene University in getting

9
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:52,019
I'm not really a back Bounty Hunter

10
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:54,510
I'm more like a researcher guy and yes I

11
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,690
do some things but that's enough of the

12
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,890
introduction and yeah let's dive right

13
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,140
into it

14
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,349
because we don't have a lot of time I

15
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,119
have some slides prepared for you so the

16
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:08,339
first thing we want to talk about when

17
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,280
we talk about the text is we always want

18
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:15,630
to yes he's some kind of taxonomy and

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,689
this is based on work of writer who yeah

20
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,899
showed this at an workshop at security

21
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:26,609
and privacy 2014 and you see we have

22
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:28,770
some categories of social engineering if

23
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:31,199
we talk about it the first one is no

24
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,109
interpersonal action so basically when

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,939
we do intelligence gathering this is

26
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:38,908
based on open source intelligence and

27
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:41,038
dumpster-diving the one the intelligence

28
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,409
is online well dumpster-diving is mostly

29
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:45,119
offline where you try to get as much

30
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:46,710
information about your victim as

31
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,319
possible by yeah

32
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:52,499
searching through trash with which can

33
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:54,959
be yeah disgusting sometimes but you

34
00:01:52,499 --> 00:01:58,259
will always find some valuable things

35
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:00,450
for example USB sticks or shredded

36
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:02,909
documents not securely shredded

37
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:06,020
documents documents that aren't shredded

38
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:09,289
at all so this is always a good idea to

39
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:12,630
to gather information if you are on site

40
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:14,640
we do open source intelligence mainly

41
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:17,939
when we conduct information gathering

42
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,109
online so and this is something my talk

43
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:24,140
will focus on

44
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:24,140
go to the cases that I prepared for you

45
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:33,209
we then have interpersonal action and

46
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:37,500
this is when we actually try to exploit

47
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:39,630
our victims which we also do in a non

48
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,130
electronic way so this is basically for

49
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,900
information in exfiltration

50
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,510
for example shoulder surfing on the

51
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,340
plane or on on the train

52
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:51,149
impersonation attacks interrogating

53
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:53,040
attacks these are not really in the

54
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,800
focus of this talk and we have

55
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,459
electronic interpersonal action which is

56
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,760
your classic smishing phishing and

57
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:05,220
phishing attacks

58
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:09,140
so we always try to gather information

59
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:12,180
about our victim beforehand and this is

60
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,890
from my point of view where social

61
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,260
engineering is either successful or

62
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:19,040
unsuccessful how how well we are

63
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:22,320
prepared about our potential victim

64
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:28,739
because if we have personal contact with

65
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:32,220
them we who it's easier for us to to

66
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:33,320
actually get victim to do something that

67
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,209
we want them to do

68
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,500
and three things that we always want

69
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:40,320
them to do when we're talking about

70
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,660
social engineering online they visit a

71
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,850
website that might look familiar but

72
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,100
actually it's not the website they are

73
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:50,790
familiar with so for example a

74
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:53,250
fraudulent login page for Twitter would

75
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:55,590
be something that is that we try to

76
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:59,100
achieve here or they download data so

77
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:00,600
your classic ransomware case or also

78
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,950
information-gathering if you install a

79
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:08,010
key logger on their on their system by

80
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:11,160
an email attachment or we want them to

81
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:13,440
carry out certain actions for this is

82
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,140
for example if we want to do SEO fraud

83
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:20,100
or password exfiltration or two factor x

84
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:22,919
situations impersonate the technician

85
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:25,979
and I want my victim to give out for

86
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:28,409
example is two-factor credentials his

87
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:32,210
second factor dentures I can yet try to

88
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:35,180
call them up and actually talk we

89
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:38,270
them for example that there was a

90
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:41,570
security issue and they I need access to

91
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:44,090
their to their private account because I

92
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:46,490
want to check if private it has lost or

93
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:49,909
some some story and you always see with

94
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:53,360
the story the whole attack that we carry

95
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:57,460
out is either successful or unsuccessful

96
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:01,070
that's why basically things like

97
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:04,159
Nigerian prince mayor's that we all have

98
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:07,280
in our inboxes are not that successful

99
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,590
it anymore like they were in the

100
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:14,750
beginning of the internet so that's

101
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:17,750
basically where someone once you two get

102
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:19,580
to get your bank account out for them

103
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,470
because they have a large amount of

104
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,000
money that they somehow need to get out

105
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:27,080
of their country or something like that

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:31,009
so that's basically our goal our goal is

107
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:34,370
to achieve personal contact and without

108
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:39,110
the person actually actually knowing

109
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:41,479
that that we that we are currently

110
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:45,530
stealing information from them and the

111
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:48,349
more personal I craft relay the more

112
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:50,270
likely I will have success and if I'm

113
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:53,949
able to smoothly integrate my attack

114
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:56,780
into the daily life of my victim I

115
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:57,409
probably will be successful so it's my

116
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:00,770
victim

117
00:05:57,409 --> 00:06:02,419
like afterwards says oh yeah I thought

118
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:07,310
that was strange but it was reasonable

119
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:10,820
reasonably reasonable request due to the

120
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:12,560
Miss configuration i I I had then my

121
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,550
attack in slightly was slightly

122
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,550
successful

123
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:24,840
the water real quick um so as I

124
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:27,500
mentioned before we will focus on open

125
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:30,119
source intelligence or yeah like a

126
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,160
subtype of it in this talk and open

127
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,860
source intelligence is always your go-to

128
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,130
method and the most important step

129
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:40,410
especially if you're not on-site at your

130
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:42,509
client but if you're sitting remotely

131
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:47,009
and you try to get as much information

132
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:51,720
out of the you're out of your your

133
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:54,120
contractor as possible so there's one

134
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,720
big problem with source intelligence

135
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,630
it's that you have too much data often

136
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,419
and then you have some sort of

137
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:08,219
information overload and you need to

138
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:11,280
prioritize your your your findings so

139
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:16,020
you need to really check ok what's what

140
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:19,679
will my victim most likely be like what

141
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:25,830
what's the pages he often visit so I can

142
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:27,599
maybe forage for a lock inside and the

143
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,969
problem is that there is so much data

144
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,849
publicly available sources can include

145
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:34,650
emails domains apiece or biometric data

146
00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:39,810
a location-based data or telephone

147
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:42,810
numbers etc and we can always find

148
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:46,500
information that is somehow crucial for

149
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:49,620
our for our attack in open source

150
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:52,949
intelligence and that's a big problem

151
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:55,080
because as our victim he might not or

152
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:57,030
she might not know which piece of

153
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,300
information aren't going to use against

154
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:01,008
him

155
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:04,430
because in scenarios I have specific

156
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:07,469
specific data that is very valuable

157
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:10,440
yeah and just as an example how Huson

158
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:13,020
looks like I just used the German hacker

159
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,150
orbit who collected mostly open source

160
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:18,448
intelligence from various sources and

161
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:24,570
then dumped it online at least that's

162
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:28,050
what Deepika pka the German Federal

163
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:30,779
Police said during their investigation

164
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:31,360
that a lot of information that was put

165
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:34,299
out

166
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,979
from the peak a PKA was either

167
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:41,578
open-source intelligence or it was

168
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:44,769
simply a lie and so this is yeah this is

169
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:47,729
the current major case on open source

170
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:50,610
intelligence at least from my opinion

171
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:54,490
because he also probably scraped

172
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:57,579
passwords that were breached and then he

173
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:59,589
locked into accounts and stole data from

174
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:03,339
personal accounts just because the

175
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:05,709
password was breached before there are

176
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:09,640
also rumors that he broke some sort of

177
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:11,199
reset account reset mechanism in Germany

178
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,250
may provide us but there's really no

179
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,980
proof about that

180
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,990
so yeah currently it's basically open

181
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:24,060
source intelligence from various sources

182
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:28,720
used against the victims of this attack

183
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:32,890
why is Owen so successful this is mainly

184
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:37,570
based on four things at least from from

185
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:39,880
what you see the first one is anglia

186
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:42,490
privacy privacy mechanisms in online

187
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:45,010
platforms sometimes they're a little bit

188
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:46,510
shady at which data is really public in

189
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:50,500
which data is not we will talk about

190
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:53,500
that in our case later we also have over

191
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:56,410
sharing of MPO ye so a lot of data is

192
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:59,890
shared which might not be shared with

193
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:01,870
the public then we have poor OPSEC

194
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:04,360
practices so operational security

195
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:07,180
practices which aren't enforced for

196
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:10,420
example don't post your badge on social

197
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:12,779
media and we have social media campaigns

198
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:15,399
that can also be a real pain for

199
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:17,890
operational security and therefore an

200
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:21,149
attack vector for someone who is using

201
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:25,630
human intelligence to attack companies

202
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:28,600
and that's the theoretical piece of my

203
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:31,269
talk we will now talk about the

204
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,430
different cases that I put up here one

205
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:36,730
case that is pretty popular from the

206
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:38,739
beginning of 2018 was the CompTIA flip

207
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:41,589
my cute competition where a lot of

208
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:43,720
people put their workspaces on Twitter

209
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:45,400
under the hashtag come to earth like you

210
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,250
it was

211
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:54,189
thing in 2018 when it came out because

212
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:56,560
there were so many of SEC leaks that

213
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:58,120
it's pretty pretty hard to to see them

214
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,699
all but as you can see on the pictures

215
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:04,210
there a lot of people just posted their

216
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:06,990
their inbox on the photo or like the

217
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:10,450
domain controller of an organization or

218
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:12,880
firewall rules so this was generally

219
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:15,340
like a real of sex fair and there are

220
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,500
other hashtags that I also provide

221
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:21,100
valuable information for example if you

222
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:24,220
are on site at a client and you use the

223
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:27,250
hashtag work batch to find like the

224
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,260
current work batch of a of an employee

225
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:32,250
you can forge that with the information

226
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:36,220
you get from the internet which is

227
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:43,200
generally it works well on Instagram and

228
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:45,850
Twitter so we also we try to yeah use

229
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,250
use Twitter hashtags or Instagram

230
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:49,780
hashtags or wherever hashtags are just

231
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,580
to search information that's basically

232
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:54,040
what they are for and we use this

233
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:56,470
information for attack scenarios for

234
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:59,500
example if you want to get fire was

235
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:03,400
firewall rules that to come to that

236
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:10,480
might you could even though I just

237
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:12,100
checked this this early and there aren't

238
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,080
much posts online anymore

239
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,600
under congested mycube there was also a

240
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,870
best off the count which also seems to

241
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:22,330
be down if there if anyone has more

242
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:27,880
information on why it is down feel free

243
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:29,650
to reach out to me so yeah that's the

244
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,780
first case study so basically here the

245
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:33,640
problem is social media that is mixed up

246
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:36,699
with poor OPSEC because these people

247
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:40,630
don't seem to be educated that you don't

248
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:45,220
put yeah information about your

249
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:47,340
workplace online or at least critical

250
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:50,640
information is something you shouldn't

251
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,640
take a photo

252
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:57,660
next step we have this over sharing of

253
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:59,370
employees and poor operational security

254
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:02,130
because they don't know that there's

255
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:07,410
actually valuable data and you take from

256
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:09,649
cast nor from 3333 his talk was tighter

257
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:12,540
when the world is Carmen Sandiego and

258
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:17,190
basically he scraped Instagram for

259
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:20,939
airline tickets and after he scraped

260
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:23,250
that he'd stolen miles from from

261
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:25,529
customers and then got free flights or

262
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:30,120
potentially got free flights and we use

263
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:33,209
that we use that as a methodology if we

264
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,180
find someone in a company who is really

265
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:38,339
active on Instagram to maybe find

266
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:40,310
information like this so we find the

267
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:44,630
employee who uses Instagram we're

268
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:47,489
regularly there's this there might be a

269
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:51,680
step in between because maybe he has a

270
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:51,680
private profile or she and we need two

271
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:58,290
stories and posts for airline tickets

272
00:13:55,890 --> 00:14:01,079
for examples or other barcodes or

273
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:03,719
personal secrets that he shares and then

274
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:05,849
we read out data from barcodes do

275
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,690
whatever is in scope of our audit and

276
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:12,810
then we profit because our successful

277
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:14,940
and here's basically the case you just

278
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,949
scrape Instagram for the hashtag

279
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:22,560
boarding pass and you will find that

280
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:25,320
there are probably now 100 and and a few

281
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:28,170
thousand of these posts are online and

282
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:31,230
then you scan the QR code with whatever

283
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:33,689
type of scanner you have at hand and

284
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:36,589
then you get this blue information which

285
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:39,390
is basically the reservation number and

286
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:41,310
it's now anonymized this ticket but

287
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:46,649
there is a last name on the ticket

288
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:51,719
and then you can lock into into the

289
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:53,730
airline and see what data was used to

290
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:59,250
actually book this ticket you can see

291
00:14:53,730 --> 00:15:02,490
booking details like with like like

292
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:05,170
details on how the ticket was purchased

293
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:06,970
what's the address maybe

294
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,738
the workplace address or the private

295
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:11,259
address you can furthermore collect

296
00:15:08,739 --> 00:15:14,949
miles which is what Casanova did in this

297
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:17,679
talk at 33 c3 or you can rebook flood

298
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:20,889
which is which is great because

299
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:23,019
sometimes in the Red Team assessment you

300
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:25,319
need to disrupt critical business

301
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:27,999
processes which could be a meeting and

302
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:30,729
this works just fine this also works

303
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:35,919
fine with at least in Germany with with

304
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:38,259
train ticket so we can we can use this

305
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:41,259
information to really disrupt business

306
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:43,149
processes which is sometimes in scope of

307
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:45,519
our achievements s mentor of our social

308
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:47,919
engineering audit and this is something

309
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:52,209
we could define as a goal and then we

310
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:55,179
reach our goal and this is yeah bad for

311
00:15:52,209 --> 00:16:03,299
the company or good for the company

312
00:15:55,179 --> 00:16:03,299
because they they can like enforce rules

313
00:16:03,689 --> 00:16:09,339
use this so that's basically this case

314
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:12,309
sorry over sharing then we have unclear

315
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:15,100
privacy mechanisms and another platform

316
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:17,040
that is pretty pretty great for unclear

317
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:20,949
privacy mechanisms is Facebook but

318
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:23,769
because everyone does Facebook I use

319
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:29,258
Java once or twice or use it once or

320
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:36,029
twice because Strava was popular in the

321
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:36,029
beginning of 2018 as well because the

322
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:53,619
and we found a methodology to to find

323
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:55,480
people who work at places and yeah the

324
00:16:53,619 --> 00:16:59,039
first step we need to take is we need to

325
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:02,379
find some place of interest so this is

326
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:04,720
this is a military side in Germany and

327
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:08,139
you can see that there is a circle on

328
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:11,620
the picture and we this circle is called

329
00:17:08,138 --> 00:17:18,089
a segment and now you can find this

330
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:20,010
segment on on your favorite fitness app

331
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:23,938
and the segment is basically something

332
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:27,510
we can compete online with other users

333
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:32,820
of this app so you you run you need to

334
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:35,610
run faster than them segment we can see

335
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:39,928
who is the best in the segment can not

336
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:46,110
only see who is the best but the 20 best

337
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:48,179
people overall and the 20 best women and

338
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:52,590
if we have a sock puppet account on our

339
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:57,059
favorite fitness app we can also all

340
00:17:52,590 --> 00:18:00,959
people who ever ran this segment unless

341
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:03,779
they stated by the time they uploaded

342
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,690
their activity that they don't want to

343
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:10,620
share this but this is pretty at least

344
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:13,470
in our favorite fitness app this is they

345
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:17,719
are pretty hard to to to achieve because

346
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:20,460
of the the way the UI and UX is designed

347
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:23,669
and so they're first pretty hard for

348
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,960
people to to hide and you can you find

349
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:27,690
information for example you find

350
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,779
information where they are stationed if

351
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:33,029
like this was a military scenario you

352
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:35,640
can find that that some of those users

353
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:37,110
we find you can track them around the

354
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,510
world where they're where they are

355
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:40,979
stationed you also find information

356
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:42,960
which brand of jogging shoe they use

357
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,480
which icicle type they use which brand

358
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,610
of bicycle they use how they are daily

359
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,770
commuting to work and stuff like that

360
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:52,260
and all of this information is something

361
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:55,620
we can then use to craft really really

362
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:58,620
good fishing campaigns we did some case

363
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:03,149
studies with a few companies here and we

364
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:05,489
see it we can we can forge pretty good

365
00:19:03,149 --> 00:19:12,479
fishing mayor's with that and people

366
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:14,520
don't recognize them as fishing and some

367
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,620
people so now the question is how do you

368
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:19,590
find people that work in the company

369
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:22,229
that you're auditing you can create

370
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:24,658
malicious segments so basically the

371
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:27,450
segment's we use before were regular

372
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:30,809
segments where we try to just the

373
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:31,500
identity anonymize people but if you

374
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:33,420
have an order

375
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,640
you can create malicious segments to

376
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:40,050
your users of a specific company into

377
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:43,140
your interview segment and then you you

378
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:45,780
have yeah activity information about

379
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,830
them as you can see here this looks

380
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,570
strange

381
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:50,909
and this looks strange this looks like

382
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:55,350
like a starting point and actually this

383
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:58,380
is a company in Germany where bicycles

384
00:19:55,350 --> 00:20:01,770
are stored during the day and this is

385
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:03,950
the way the commuters of those people

386
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:06,690
who come back we'll leave the the

387
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:11,990
company so we can create our malicious a

388
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:16,050
second year by uploading a GPX file and

389
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:19,530
then by the time they start commuting

390
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:23,760
home and they activate yet we will

391
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:28,200
directly see in our segment and who they

392
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:30,900
are which and then depending on we see

393
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,210
all the types of information that I

394
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:36,810
mentioned earlier and this is a pretty

395
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:38,790
good scenario if you have like a company

396
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:42,290
that has more than a hundred employees

397
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:46,040
you can find those patterns and just

398
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:47,280
yeah use that for your audit and craft

399
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,720
yes

400
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,320
phishing phishing campaigns that are a

401
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,330
little bit yeah off the beaten track so

402
00:20:52,320 --> 00:21:00,450
they are harder to detect in our

403
00:20:54,330 --> 00:21:04,620
experience and this is something that we

404
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:06,930
like to do originally Nathan Russa

405
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:19,530
discovered this privacy leak on the heat

406
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:22,440
map he discovered he privately mmm about

407
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:29,040
the military bases that were secret and

408
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:32,610
that they were revered by oh as the last

409
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:39,030
case study I have something that is that

410
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:45,209
we found out recently that is that yeah

411
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:49,020
um that ATMs wait don't

412
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:51,330
draw cash from but you load up your your

413
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:54,870
Oyster card for example or like your

414
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:59,330
your daily commute car for public for

415
00:21:54,870 --> 00:22:02,399
public trains so whenever no money is

416
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:05,460
coming out of a machine there isn't

417
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:08,010
there is no structural security so as

418
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:11,370
you can see this is basically in the

419
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:14,310
university which I attended see that

420
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:20,939
someone can photograph from the way up

421
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:24,110
and sitting here and just means like in

422
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,110
a pretty old-fashioned way

423
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,930
train stations where you pay for your

424
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:33,450
way you can pay for your ticket on on

425
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:35,610
such a machine and you don't get out

426
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:37,920
cash so there is low structure of

427
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:42,330
security and that's the way we pretty

428
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:46,430
substantially fish earlier so this is

429
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:51,629
just a little bonus for the talk and

430
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:52,410
yeah some tools that that we find or I

431
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:54,180
find useful

432
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:56,430
the first one is data Floyd if you are

433
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:59,250
gathering a lot of information in little

434
00:22:56,430 --> 00:23:01,560
time but it's pretty unorganized the way

435
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:03,420
it comes from github but it's easy to

436
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:07,110
extend an organize so for example we can

437
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:09,270
dump every information we find in if

438
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:12,949
you're using elastic just put it in

439
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:16,800
elastic and then do some some analyst

440
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:18,840
analysis on the data if you need to

441
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,370
check something real quick internet

442
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,169
techniques is really helpful because

443
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:24,270
they provide a web page where you can

444
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:26,160
just put on whatever kind of information

445
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:28,590
you find so maybe it's a domain or maybe

446
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:32,040
it's an IP you find and then you can

447
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:40,139
just use inter techniques to get direct

448
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:42,090
access to the best research if you are

449
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,160
taking a whole company we can use

450
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:46,439
everything back bounty hunter normally

451
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,930
uses to increase its attack surface and

452
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,240
other information about it so maybe we

453
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:53,040
can do subdomain enumeration we can do

454
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,290
an nmap weaponize or whatever you want

455
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,180
to do a review source code to just find

456
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:58,168
information that really shouldn't be out

457
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:00,269
there

458
00:23:58,169 --> 00:24:03,029
which is normally considered private and

459
00:24:00,269 --> 00:24:05,850
then use this to get to another

460
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:08,159
information and then craft our personal

461
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:11,219
contact with with the company or with an

462
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,200
employee of the company another thing

463
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,119
that I found pretty useful and that is

464
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,980
less talked about is that you need to

465
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:18,600
audit your own operational security if

466
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,820
you add interacting with the company

467
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:23,549
directly so use burner phones use tor

468
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:27,509
use VPN whatever you need just so you

469
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:33,600
don't get yeah that you yet you're not

470
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:39,289
too noisy and you you get lost in austen

471
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:41,969
the data and which is also quite useful

472
00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:48,989
but not a must for social engineering or

473
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:51,720
oesn't is really easily you can also use

474
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:54,149
go i just forgot whatever script

475
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,139
language using so bit of scripting is

476
00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:57,139
always useful

477
00:24:58,429 --> 00:25:06,869
yes that was my talk I'm a little bit I

478
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:12,619
took 25 minutes I just check real quick

479
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:12,619
if I have some questions on Twitter

480
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:30,299
accounts that I find pretty useful

481
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:31,769
whenever I'm yeah when I'm looking for

482
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:35,239
inspiration or when I'm looking for cool

483
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:38,399
stories tinker SEC is really great he's

484
00:25:35,239 --> 00:25:40,559
he's sharing Red Team stories like Neil

485
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:42,809
not in real time but he shares them

486
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:46,320
after this engagements which is pretty

487
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:51,830
entertaining yeah I just scrolled

488
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:54,178
through the latest it takes a crowd

489
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:57,539
hashtags and I don't see a question for

490
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:59,330
me so I'm done with my talk I hope you

491
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:02,309
enjoyed it and you learned a little bit

492
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:03,869
about social engineering open-source

493
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:09,520
intelligence and how you can gather

494
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:11,919
information and yeah maybe this will

495
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,500
you with back bounding because for me

496
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:18,130
I've collected some back bounties while

497
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:19,990
researching this because all the data we

498
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:24,340
