1
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:13,340
okay thank you very much on a great day

2
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:14,660
I've been in and out of the virtual

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,930
conference there's been some awesome

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:20,599
talks with a lot of information so glad

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:23,090
to be part of it and everything else so

6
00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:26,090
thank you for the invitation and

7
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:28,670
everything so um when I first saw the

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:32,628
opportunity to think about what would I

9
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:36,830
tell people with that I thought about my

10
00:00:32,628 --> 00:00:39,290
toolbox because it's something that used

11
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:41,059
to be that was what was your tradecraft

12
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:43,610
that was what you it was your secret

13
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:47,479
sauce that was what a lot of things that

14
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:49,280
people wanted to do and then when I

15
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:53,269
started looking you kind of look out

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,580
there and there is a flood of different

17
00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:57,710
tools and everything else around that so

18
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:00,140
started putting a little thought process

19
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:02,780
into that and saying okay what what do I

20
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,339
use and how do I use it and sometimes I

21
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,020
use different tools than a lot of other

22
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:08,658
people use and sometimes everybody who

23
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:12,140
did the same thing and then in my world

24
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:15,140
of be NSC so I have this thing called

25
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:17,720
budget and I can buy lots of really

26
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,850
expensive tools and sometimes they work

27
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,100
really good and sometimes the

28
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:25,160
open-source world or the free tools work

29
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:28,460
much even better than these so it's kind

30
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:30,259
of this world of why do I want to use

31
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:36,080
and how do I want to use it as a lot of

32
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:40,400
the cases that's there so to quote

33
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:42,440
American philosopher Jeff Spicoli from

34
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,840
Fast Times at Ridgemont High I've dated

35
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:48,679
myself I've been doing this way longer

36
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,870
than they're one of his things was he's

37
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,420
got an ultimate set of tools it can I

38
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:57,500
can fix it if I have the right tools I

39
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:59,900
can do just about anything along those

40
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,780
lines and I also have like two quotes

41
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:05,299
from my parents one my dad always used

42
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:07,190
to tell me with a great set of tools you

43
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:09,080
can break anything and he wasn't talking

44
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:11,510
about software tools at that point in

45
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,030
time his regular tools yes you can break

46
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,760
things very easy if you have the right

47
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:18,830
tools you can also fix things but in a

48
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,140
lot of times you're more along the lines

49
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,960
of

50
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:24,600
breaking things my mom always used to

51
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:28,200
tell me why do I need 15 screwdrivers or

52
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:30,120
12 pairs of pliers and it was always one

53
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,000
of the things you need different things

54
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:37,650
to be able to deal with those functions

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,530
and sometimes the easiest access to to a

56
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,000
thing and a unique one and it may be a

57
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,480
favorite one or something along those

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,739
lines and then Batman is just a rich guy

59
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,780
with cool tools and and the end of the

60
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:54,300
side of it is I'm not really a Batman

61
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,530
fan I'm more of a Punisher person and

62
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,580
people that know me know that all too

63
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:02,790
well but it's the same idea is that

64
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:05,430
tools allow you to do things that you

65
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,829
wouldn't normally be able to do whether

66
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:10,500
it's speed whether it's complexity

67
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:12,390
whether it's those ideas around that and

68
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,540
this is why this talk is shifted around

69
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:17,790
a couple of things so a little about me

70
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,769
now so you kind of know where I'm coming

71
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,019
from I'm C so from Motorola I've been C

72
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:24,329
so for like ten years which usually in C

73
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:27,780
so years I should have died long ago I

74
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:31,950
do have a crazy family on that side of

75
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:35,519
it and it's all part of the fun that's

76
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:39,390
there I have all sorts of stories about

77
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,500
my daughter's understanding CAPTCHA my

78
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:46,140
daughter's understanding your password

79
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,970
questions and why they're stupid and why

80
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:51,390
they can answer each other's password

81
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:55,859
questions to reset each other's accounts

82
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:57,869
I had an awkward conversation with one

83
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,950
of the Vice Principals at one of my

84
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:07,079
daughter's schools where she had

85
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:09,959
bypassed the app control library on her

86
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:12,959
iPad and loaded a game on her iPad that

87
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,489
she was playing in math class I gave her

88
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,200
a fist bump Who am I talking to the Vice

89
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:18,090
Principal when I learned about it that

90
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,579
she had detention for that reason Vice

91
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:23,159
Principal didn't find that funny I did

92
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,320
but I had to explain what I did and how

93
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,840
this was a good thing she still didn't

94
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,690
get it that's there I've done this a

95
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,549
really long time I've done corporate

96
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:34,560
I've done startups I've done a lot of

97
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,630
different functionalities I've written

98
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,120
tons of articles you think we'll go out

99
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:41,310
and Google here's one undoing hacking

100
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,260
the White House by Wireless here's

101
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,960
another one on wireless security and

102
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:48,419
retail space back in 2000 long before a

103
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,719
lot of the Wi-Fi stuff was going on and

104
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:54,510
it's it's continuing out there in the

105
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:58,710
area and along with the process that's

106
00:04:54,510 --> 00:05:01,050
there I'm a lot of Cisco by Casey so by

107
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:05,159
day I work for some of the largest

108
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:08,280
companies I chase bad people most of my

109
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:10,650
day they're trying to do bad things to

110
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,650
my organization and other organizations

111
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:15,870
around the world so I spend a lot of

112
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:18,539
time and doing some of this stuff so

113
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:21,000
some of my approaches or around speed

114
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:23,520
some of my approaches are around hey

115
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,909
what can I look at really quickly and

116
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:29,460
determine things that are around that

117
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:30,780
I'm a speaker conference jockey fanboy

118
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,239
whatever you want to call it

119
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:37,260
I'd like to attend conferences around

120
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:40,620
that if you know a cool conference you

121
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:44,099
can tweet me at sec rich or my contact

122
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:48,120
details are in here you can get me on

123
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:49,530
that side of it I like to attend new

124
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,479
things I have to think of conferences

125
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:55,200
like restaurants there's always a new

126
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:57,000
flavor a new way and some conferences

127
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,090
are not for everyone some conferences

128
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,430
are around there so try to attend quite

129
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:05,609
a few number or and speak at a quite a

130
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,710
few around the world in a lot of cases

131
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,030
that are there and I'm always in search

132
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:12,930
of more time because they don't have

133
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:15,719
enough I'm a security researcher by

134
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:18,090
night and I always say what happens at

135
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,870
night stays at night I've been doing

136
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:22,440
security research

137
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:27,690
well longer than I've been C so probably

138
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:31,669
closer to 20 years I have a bunch of

139
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:35,430
zero days that I've given for different

140
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:37,680
companies and organizations around part

141
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:41,760
of that unfortunately a part of the zero

142
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,720
days where many many many scary legal

143
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,599
letters that I

144
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,230
from the places that we were giving out

145
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,590
or I'm providing information to and

146
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:54,570
saying hey you really need to fix this

147
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:58,140
followed by don't talk about it never

148
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:59,820
mention that and system to cease at all

149
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,770
activity that you're actually doing it

150
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,530
was a really nice thing you know the way

151
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:06,930
I looked at it maybe not so much but

152
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:10,590
that's where that kind of dealt with

153
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:13,110
that and I always looked for one of the

154
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:16,640
things I really understand fubar and you

155
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:20,400
can open dictionary that if you need to

156
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:23,250
when you see it and that's kind of where

157
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,260
I've always got into the security things

158
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,840
once I see something I'm like this is

159
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,849
wrong let me figure out what's wrong

160
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,770
with it and it could be a device it

161
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,070
could be a app it could be something

162
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,710
else

163
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:36,900
so my triggers are kind of when I see

164
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:39,000
something to run across something find

165
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:42,870
it then that's how I want to actually go

166
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,230
into it that's there so kind of the

167
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:50,100
first area and the one or a lot of the

168
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:52,920
vulnerability scanners run and and and

169
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,630
and such dynamic analysis other things

170
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,190
that are around there and I'm really

171
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:59,580
broken it down into some key areas

172
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:04,050
there's not a perfect solution let's be

173
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:06,659
honest everybody has their own method

174
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:08,970
and everybody has their own desire to do

175
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,590
the scanning so if you think of from a

176
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:13,740
sea stroke perspective I've had a scan

177
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:16,349
millions of IP address spaces in my

178
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:19,770
environment versus a very small segment

179
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:21,690
so speed flexibility and everything else

180
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:23,370
is the choice that you're looking at

181
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:27,330
versus some of the other things that are

182
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:30,450
there and one of the things I do like in

183
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:33,179
a lot of cases is that the community

184
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:36,169
editions of most the tools that are out

185
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:38,520
there are actually better than the

186
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:40,559
production tools that you currently have

187
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,659
that are being deployed because around

188
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,510
the production tools I have a different

189
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:48,209
requirement my production tool needs to

190
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:51,540
eliminate as many false positives as

191
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:53,220
possible and be very successful if

192
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,260
there's an exploitation and I tell you

193
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,780
to exploit it it has to exploit it it

194
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,880
has to

195
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:00,730
well and it has to do a time and time

196
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,500
and time and time again so a lot of the

197
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:06,370
things that are in the community edition

198
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:09,760
think of it as beta they're pre before

199
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:12,940
they actually go into the regular stable

200
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,950
version of the edition or what I get

201
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,630
shipped as the professional version so

202
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,790
the tools that are actually there so the

203
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:22,300
community ditions actually have a leg up

204
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:24,579
in a lot of cases of these tools and so

205
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:28,180
that's why I like to lose a lot of those

206
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:29,920
whether it's the rapid7 Expos or any of

207
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,930
the other professional-grade scanners

208
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,030
typically have a Community Edition that

209
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:36,099
you can use and limitations with that

210
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:38,620
now sometimes the limitations are hey

211
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:44,080
you can scan an IP address block you

212
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:47,830
can't scan I external IP addresses etc

213
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,430
with that and that's true just always

214
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:53,500
remember the network address translation

215
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:57,489
Association you can leverage at the same

216
00:09:53,500 --> 00:10:01,300
time on devices as well so the there's

217
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:04,180
there's ways but one of the things is

218
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:08,620
that it's it's the area to be focused

219
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:10,300
with that's there I'm a big fan and I

220
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,670
was glad the previous conversation was

221
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:15,010
talking about burp suite that's a long

222
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,939
time in my toolbox if you can afford a

223
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:20,710
professional road the pro version is is

224
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:23,140
really sharp really supported big

225
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:25,930
community effort I think that's one of

226
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:28,360
the big things that I look at for a lot

227
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:30,579
of my tools they fall into the same

228
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,380
community standards that are there is

229
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:35,530
that there is a community supporting the

230
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:37,540
tools there's pages of functions people

231
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:39,220
are going in and out of that but I think

232
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,410
that's one of the key areas that are

233
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,120
around things that are around that one

234
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:44,980
of the big things that I start looking

235
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,710
for specialties and some of the other

236
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,900
stuff that's around that so things that

237
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:53,440
can run in other platforms in other

238
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:55,930
words I don't necessarily need Windows

239
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,030
or a Linux box every time I want to be

240
00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:00,040
able to do a tool or someplace else

241
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:03,880
that's why I like things like Python and

242
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:07,599
Java capabilities because I can run them

243
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,889
in a lot of different locations and get

244
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,319
closer to where I need

245
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:14,170
run them from or in some cases I'm

246
00:11:11,319 --> 00:11:16,988
already inside the area that I need to

247
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:20,290
run them around that that includes like

248
00:11:16,989 --> 00:11:22,149
Vega which is java-based and then some

249
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,939
of the load basing if I've got to do a

250
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:27,970
lot of things because sometimes you come

251
00:11:24,939 --> 00:11:30,309
back and I'm like where you start how do

252
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:32,439
I want to look what am I looking for or

253
00:11:30,309 --> 00:11:35,769
I've got a lot of load that I want to

254
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:37,839
process so very deep web sites and

255
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:40,859
everything else some of the stuff that's

256
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:43,540
really big and bulky as I refer to it as

257
00:11:40,859 --> 00:11:45,970
Google's skip fish tool does a really

258
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,769
good process function that's really

259
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,209
lightweight on the CPU and everything

260
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:52,509
else is not trying to kill you

261
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:55,419
but does handle a lot of a lot of app

262
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:59,049
side functionality that's around there

263
00:11:55,419 --> 00:12:01,689
in some of those other ones and then you

264
00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:04,749
can go back go down at the the other

265
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:08,769
side of it is sometimes people like

266
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:11,829
Louise other times people like command

267
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:14,230
line it's a choice it's just perspective

268
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:17,410
sometimes the command line people are

269
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:21,279
just happy with other times people are

270
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:23,769
trying to one and GUI just because it's

271
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,600
it's more configurable and some of the

272
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:27,549
other options that are there it's a

273
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,009
preference and there's not a right or

274
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:31,959
wrong answer for it but and some of the

275
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:34,239
times a lot of people look at the other

276
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:38,529
features and that's what I typically do

277
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:40,779
on some of these areas if I've got

278
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:42,790
things that are in JavaScript I maybe

279
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:45,610
use grabber to look at it to look for

280
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:48,549
possible exploitation or something in

281
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:51,100
Ajax that's around that I do my

282
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:55,089
programming is not the best in the world

283
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:57,549
I spend a lot of time in Python and so a

284
00:12:55,089 --> 00:13:00,069
lot of my sets and everything else are

285
00:12:57,549 --> 00:13:01,959
around Python just because that's where

286
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:05,108
I mean they're coming from or going to

287
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:10,599
in a lot of cases for what I'm actually

288
00:13:05,109 --> 00:13:12,279
trying to do in some of those areas one

289
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,289
of the things I see in my environment is

290
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:18,970
the vulnerability scanners that are

291
00:13:14,289 --> 00:13:21,339
people are using against me and a lot of

292
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,010
times it's actually acts some of the

293
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:26,300
open bass

294
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:30,680
stuff Neko some of the proxies and

295
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:33,680
everything else the side of that is a

296
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,209
lot of these have distinct signatures in

297
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,189
the packets in the way they craft the

298
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:39,320
packets so that they're tagged and says

299
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:41,000
hey this is an SSK 'nor and it gets

300
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,430
picked up and it gets picked up by the

301
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,290
firewall picked up by the laughs or

302
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:48,650
picked up by the intrusion detection

303
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:51,170
system on the other side of it so that's

304
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:52,850
three different things that can do

305
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,370
something to you now one of the key

306
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:57,950
areas that a lot of people don't

307
00:13:54,370 --> 00:14:00,020
understand is that on the enterprise

308
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:02,870
side and everything else a lot of

309
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:05,300
organizations are using vulnerability

310
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:07,460
blocking rules on firewalls and

311
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,920
vulnerability blocking rules and laughs

312
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:11,930
type of environments that are there so

313
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,380
that if there's a phone ability that's

314
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:17,660
there and you may find it because of a

315
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:20,180
versioning issue or something else

316
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:24,260
that's popping up and said oh this is an

317
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:27,170
old version of PHP 5.5 okay I know

318
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:29,170
exactly what to do now and now you try

319
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:32,150
and nothing happens

320
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:35,300
I've posted me I fold enough red team

321
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:37,069
exercises doing that that it's

322
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,959
aggravating because you're like why is

323
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:42,950
it there is everything she says that

324
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:45,110
this is a legit issue and it is but it's

325
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:47,990
being blocked in other words it's it's

326
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:50,060
stopping the firewall or the proxy or

327
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:52,670
something is stopping the tool that's

328
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:54,170
actually going through that it doesn't

329
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:57,229
say the vulnerability doesn't exist

330
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:59,510
so some of that can be submissions and

331
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,910
things like that other times though it's

332
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:04,310
like okay how do i bypass how these

333
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:08,630
things are stopping well sometimes the

334
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:10,760
way that the vulnerability is is being

335
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:13,340
trying to be exploited it is sometimes a

336
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,200
common tool sometimes proof of concept

337
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,430
software and everything else they

338
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,800
literally took that same

339
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:21,890
proof-of-concept software wrote the

340
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:26,750
blocking rules for it wrote it identical

341
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:29,569
for that particular function and there

342
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:31,490
it goes with that and it stops it so

343
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,200
anything that's being generated at that

344
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:35,329
will always stop it so it's time to

345
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,799
chain it up you add some padding

346
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:40,819
you change some of the other stuff or

347
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:43,100
use something similar to scat it's copy

348
00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:46,040
or something else one of the network

349
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:48,079
protocols or change enough things around

350
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,649
it to do the recent mission of it so

351
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:53,388
that it looks different or put it into

352
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:56,149
HTTP environment for some of these stuff

353
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:58,220
or SSL so they they don't see it they're

354
00:15:56,149 --> 00:16:00,199
not breaking it so necessarily some of

355
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:03,699
this stuff comes all the way across in

356
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:05,599
some of those areas but a lot of times

357
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:07,008
just because you're not getting a

358
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,319
positive result does not mean that

359
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:11,689
vulnerability is not exploitable it's

360
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:13,939
just a matter of taking the time to go

361
00:16:11,689 --> 00:16:16,368
back and figure a way around the

362
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:18,139
obstacle that's actually there so a lot

363
00:16:16,369 --> 00:16:19,579
of times when people are looking for

364
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:21,499
things they're looking for things and

365
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:23,118
they're overlooking this they go oh well

366
00:16:21,499 --> 00:16:25,549
this wasn't exploitable so it's not a

367
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:26,989
problem or this is that and that's not

368
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:29,480
always the case some of them are very

369
00:16:26,989 --> 00:16:31,759
distinct that's actually something is

370
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,929
bad it's just the fact that the

371
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,850
firewalls are doing what they're

372
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:37,610
designed to do and that's their

373
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:41,029
mitigating controls but it's time to

374
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:43,970
move on from that fix the problem that's

375
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:46,279
there because many times these are just

376
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:48,889
by passable I don't want to say by

377
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:51,139
trivial functionality but once it's

378
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:53,389
found it's usually pretty pretty common

379
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:56,809
and easy to be able to bypass and a lot

380
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:59,899
of the cases that are there now one of

381
00:16:56,809 --> 00:17:04,189
the areas that gets into this is is what

382
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:08,539
in size toolbox do you actually need

383
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:11,480
because in some cases standing up some

384
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:14,179
of these tools like a good example is

385
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:17,689
open vas and some of the other ones very

386
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:20,990
expansive tool very capable tool very

387
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:23,419
open in its arena that's actually there

388
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:25,519
but it's a bunch of different components

389
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:27,139
all tied together a lot of the

390
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:29,710
open-source tools start getting into

391
00:17:27,138 --> 00:17:33,408
well here's my engines here's my

392
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:36,980
databases here's my reporting system

393
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:40,279
here's my console and you end up with

394
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:42,799
like I need like six separate servers or

395
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:45,260
lo and behold I can run them all in one

396
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,240
giant VM environment which kind of

397
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,300
defeats some of the purposes of around

398
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,520
this but

399
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:53,399
idea behind that though unfortunately is

400
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,080
that it's complicated to upgrade it's

401
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,090
complicated to maintain and it's

402
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,220
complicated to to do some of the

403
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:02,389
environments that are there but they're

404
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:04,230
very powerful in some of those areas so

405
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:06,870
there's some advantages and

406
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:08,550
disadvantages one advantage is once I

407
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:12,239
put some of these tools up and let them

408
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:14,490
rip they inject and work with multiple

409
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,770
sets of tools along this thing so it's

410
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:20,100
kind of one shot than in study and then

411
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:22,350
I can make a plan based upon some of

412
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:25,500
those other capabilities that are around

413
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:28,439
there a lot of times multiple tools

414
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:31,170
allows me rapid scans a good example of

415
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:34,230
this I can deduct the false positives so

416
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:36,030
I'm not spending a bunch of time on a

417
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:39,900
lot of different things that are around

418
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:42,180
there on one side or another side that

419
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,160
says hey is this I'm chasing things that

420
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:46,200
say hey here's a false positive here's

421
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,420
not a false positive it's like if two

422
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,850
two will say that there's an issue the

423
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:54,930
likelihood that it is an issue very very

424
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:56,490
very high on a lot of times the

425
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:59,520
information gathering and the other

426
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:02,250
capabilities around that or some of the

427
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,780
better results sometimes you have tools

428
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,820
that are like I'm going to go out and

429
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:07,530
get the network components of this I'm

430
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,540
going to go out and look at DNS and I'm

431
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:11,190
gonna go out and look at the application

432
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:13,920
side of the house and I'm going to do

433
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:16,920
this simultaneously the problem is that

434
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,780
as you move some of this stuff around

435
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:23,280
that and then some of those areas how do

436
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:24,780
I bring those together to do better and

437
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,460
that's one of the key things a lot of

438
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,830
times when you have these multiple sets

439
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,930
of tools it's kind of like oh I'm going

440
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:33,510
to look at a port scan first before I go

441
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:35,430
try all the ports to see what's there

442
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:37,620
it's the same kind of stair-step

443
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:39,510
scenario is that I need portions of this

444
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:42,929
data and how do I get that data and

445
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:44,730
leverage and use that and that's part of

446
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:46,500
the part of the arena and part of the

447
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:49,290
process that goes into a lot of that

448
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:54,570
that's just around that that scenarios

449
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:56,909
in a lot of cases that's there so one of

450
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:59,520
the things there are a lot of Universal

451
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:00,870
tools just due to the age of things that

452
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,600
are out there

453
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:05,879
so part of the issue is that yes you're

454
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,530
gonna have tools that have been expanded

455
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,020
and expanded expanded the community

456
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:14,340
effort can make tools do a lot of

457
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:16,379
different things great examples in map

458
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:19,559
and Metasploit have been around for

459
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:24,210
years and there are they're super

460
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:26,670
popular and they're super easy to find

461
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:28,590
information that are based around a lot

462
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:31,860
of those things and I think it's one of

463
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:36,120
the key areas that's there that allows

464
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:39,959
you to to deal with some of those now I

465
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:42,270
will be the first to say that out of all

466
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:45,720
these tools a lot of those the in map

467
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:48,870
Metasploit necess is another one the

468
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:53,130
proxies whether it's the rad Pharos and

469
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:53,399
some of the other scenarios that are out

470
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:56,850
there

471
00:20:53,400 --> 00:21:00,140
Suites another one that you how people

472
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:03,059
use the tool is very different and

473
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:05,309
there's a lot of web information a lot

474
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:07,530
of Twitter functions that are there

475
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:10,290
there's tons of different pieces of

476
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:13,260
sources of out there to be able to

477
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:15,149
leverage and use that to go after some

478
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,379
of these things because I would say that

479
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:19,440
a lot of these tools

480
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:22,110
most people use maybe somewhere in the

481
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,270
neighborhood of 20 to 30 percent of the

482
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:25,678
capabilities of the tool and you can

483
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:28,200
talk to somebody that's used it for

484
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,730
years and tell them hey have you looked

485
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,670
at this and they're like I didn't know

486
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:34,710
it did it and that's a lot of the things

487
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:38,700
you've learned something new and a lot

488
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:41,910
of cases that's there because it's it's

489
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:45,030
just that it's just that way as you're

490
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:48,210
typically using your same set and you're

491
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:49,980
moving through and processing the data

492
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:51,809
and finding out and going through that

493
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,880
and you're using only a small portion of

494
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:56,370
it just because that was what you

495
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,200
leveraged and use when you first started

496
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:01,139
or that's what you're familiar with as

497
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:04,230
you go through that and they do change

498
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:06,750
they do get better and better as things

499
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:09,600
go on so it's kind of the vice-grip

500
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:12,120
model of tools is like hey I can make a

501
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,090
universal function that's actually there

502
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,639
and

503
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:19,840
and out there so one of the ones that I

504
00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:22,809
always like is like in map with the map

505
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,970
scripting engine so at a good example of

506
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:28,658
that is a scripting language based on

507
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:30,820
I'll that basically allows you to script

508
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:34,240
up what you're trying to do in a lot of

509
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:38,860
these areas so by default in map comes

510
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:42,539
with about over 600 scripts only about a

511
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:45,610
hundred and fifty are enabled by default

512
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:49,990
so you only have 150 that are sitting

513
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:52,269
out there the rest you need to be

514
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:55,059
invoked directly so there's only about

515
00:22:52,269 --> 00:22:57,340
150 that are used by the application the

516
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:59,980
rest of them you have to go invoke

517
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:02,230
directly on that and here's a bunch of

518
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:06,039
my favorites to actually use in a lot of

519
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:08,379
cases that's there and they all do

520
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:11,309
different things from enumerated your

521
00:23:08,379 --> 00:23:15,399
server path environments to DNS

522
00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:19,178
enumeration looking for your death your

523
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:20,619
pride your pre pride your backup to all

524
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:23,710
these different things it will try to

525
00:23:20,619 --> 00:23:26,709
look for this and your DNS to go look

526
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:29,679
for other areas and to focus in around

527
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:33,580
that the same thing for mapping those

528
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:35,799
sites doing a layout with that looking

529
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,509
at your firewalls what's in front of me

530
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:40,809
that I gotta worry about is there

531
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:43,240
anything in front of me that's there all

532
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:45,519
those different things pulled to that

533
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:48,249
there there are some of the other stuff

534
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:50,860
that's around dealing with

535
00:23:48,249 --> 00:23:55,899
vulnerabilities and in doing full scans

536
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:58,979
so vulnerable scan are our two scripts

537
00:23:55,899 --> 00:24:02,258
for in map that looks for CVS they use

538
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:04,269
database one uses one locally one will

539
00:24:02,259 --> 00:24:06,129
go out and pull out the database that

540
00:24:04,269 --> 00:24:07,990
basically looking for common see bees

541
00:24:06,129 --> 00:24:10,029
and see if they can actually pull and

542
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:13,029
look for those that are there these are

543
00:24:10,029 --> 00:24:14,980
great pieces of software to give you a

544
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:17,529
cursory look a lot of times when you're

545
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:19,480
starting to look for a scam once why do

546
00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:21,820
I need to scan multiple times around

547
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,820
portions of this to be able to do it

548
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:26,770
this also goes back to looking for your

549
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,960
web application firewalls

550
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:33,190
is there one what's the fingerprint is

551
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,440
it something in the cloud is it

552
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:37,950
something on prim a lot of those areas

553
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,990
that are around they're looking for

554
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:43,420
scripting for errors we saw or than the

555
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:45,880
earlier presentation where sometimes

556
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:48,040
Erica its divulged lots of different

557
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,380
things so the same kind of error is

558
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:53,940
looking for what is available on the

559
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:57,010
sites that's there there are plenty of

560
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,929
scripts for applications there's plenty

561
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:01,510
of brute-force scripts I don't know of

562
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:04,210
anything that's not a brute forcible

563
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:07,210
function that's actually out there and

564
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:10,300
you can always do a script help for the

565
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:12,160
particular script and it will download

566
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:17,770
the script tell you what it actually

567
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:22,059
does and in and of itself again you can

568
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:24,540
look at the documents a 10 micron award

569
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:27,399
for NSE it's kind of the source of truth

570
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:30,610
there's a hashtag on Twitter side called

571
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:32,980
discovery NSE which is is a great place

572
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:35,050
to go find what community editions of

573
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:36,580
people thrown out looking for some of

574
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:39,040
the same things because again it's one

575
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:42,189
of the things that people it's easy

576
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:45,550
quick painless and a lot of people

577
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:47,710
already did your work for you and so a

578
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:49,510
lot of times these are great if I'm

579
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:50,830
trying to look at an app I'm trying to

580
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:53,620
prove force or trying to look at

581
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:55,480
something these give you great ideas of

582
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:58,330
how to situate this thing so I don't

583
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,610
spend time having to look at the

584
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:03,460
communication that's there rewrite

585
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:05,530
what's actually there bring it out it's

586
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:07,120
already done so a lot of times you can

587
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:09,160
bring in a lot of pieces of the data

588
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:14,219
that's actually there that's along the

589
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:16,660
line that's there so one of my quick

590
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:18,940
areas that I deal with and I spend a lot

591
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:21,429
of time with sandbox is just due to the

592
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:24,400
malware components of this but in in

593
00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:26,380
doing so you always discover that hey

594
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:31,900
guess what these are great for looking

595
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:34,570
for binary executables regular sites web

596
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:36,580
sites as well because I pull back the

597
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:38,439
JavaScript I pull back all the content

598
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:40,509
is that so in some of the cases that's

599
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,879
there and also the Sam boxes are doing

600
00:26:40,509 --> 00:26:46,329
my work for me so if I don't want to

601
00:26:42,879 --> 00:26:47,468
look like I'm coming from where I want

602
00:26:46,329 --> 00:26:48,369
to come from I want to come from

603
00:26:47,469 --> 00:26:50,289
someplace else

604
00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:54,329
these are a great opportunity to have

605
00:26:50,289 --> 00:26:57,809
something much on that side of it um

606
00:26:54,329 --> 00:27:04,479
there's always the build one versus buy

607
00:26:57,809 --> 00:27:09,969
or free ones for my perspective the

608
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:16,829
build one they are one of the standards

609
00:27:09,969 --> 00:27:18,699
that are there but kuku is one of the

610
00:27:16,829 --> 00:27:22,559
containerization vm's

611
00:27:18,699 --> 00:27:25,449
it's hard to upkeep and keep up to date

612
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:27,249
just in its environment and I highly

613
00:27:25,449 --> 00:27:31,149
suggest using containers for this rather

614
00:27:27,249 --> 00:27:33,429
than actual server but it's one of the

615
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:35,258
things that yeah they're great

616
00:27:33,429 --> 00:27:38,049
but it's there's a lot of upkeep

617
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:40,899
involved in a lot of sandboxing that's

618
00:27:38,049 --> 00:27:43,749
there cuz again oh whoa I need Windows

619
00:27:40,899 --> 00:27:46,899
10 or and you know Linux or I need an

620
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:49,059
iOS or I need an android emulator and

621
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:51,849
then oh I need this version or I need

622
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:54,279
this version or I need this version so a

623
00:27:51,849 --> 00:27:55,809
lot of those you end up with okay

624
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:57,639
there's more and more of these and

625
00:27:55,809 --> 00:28:00,489
there's a lot of stuff that's there

626
00:27:57,639 --> 00:28:02,678
around that side of it it's there so

627
00:28:00,489 --> 00:28:05,199
there's a lot of community additions

628
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:07,119
slash free ones that are there they have

629
00:28:05,199 --> 00:28:12,209
limitations so it's like hey you can

630
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:14,948
submit ten binaries to us every month or

631
00:28:12,209 --> 00:28:17,139
there's a small subset of there some of

632
00:28:14,949 --> 00:28:19,059
them are allow for pay some of them are

633
00:28:17,139 --> 00:28:21,428
allow for research there's a lot of

634
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:24,428
different variations along the same

635
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:26,249
lines with that and there's a lot of

636
00:28:24,429 --> 00:28:29,949
specifications so some of them are

637
00:28:26,249 --> 00:28:32,559
across platforms oh I have iOS Android

638
00:28:29,949 --> 00:28:35,229
Windows different versions windows 7

639
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,809
windows 10 windows with office windows

640
00:28:35,229 --> 00:28:39,909
with Adobe etc with that some of them

641
00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:42,249
are very specific I'm looking for other

642
00:28:39,909 --> 00:28:45,190
pieces of Wrath so some of the ones that

643
00:28:42,249 --> 00:28:47,169
I like and the reports on to the right

644
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:49,719
on here and and again you think about

645
00:28:47,169 --> 00:28:51,940
this these are guides around what things

646
00:28:49,719 --> 00:28:53,110
are coming out so it tells me especially

647
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:55,690
around applique

648
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:58,120
what kind of controls are in there are

649
00:28:55,690 --> 00:29:00,430
you operating at administrative levels

650
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:03,340
do your self promote do you do some of

651
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:06,370
these things that as somebody looking

652
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:09,189
for exploitation it's the perfect place

653
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:12,429
that go really quick really find I need

654
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:14,710
this and now I know my targets rich

655
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:17,230
environment of like here is where I want

656
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:20,650
to actually go some of the other

657
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:22,990
versions will have code analysis

658
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:24,580
sections that are there so as it comes

659
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:26,770
in it breaks out the code and does a

660
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:30,280
visualization on the code analysis and

661
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:32,530
sometimes you can see the I don't know

662
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:36,490
what you want to call it band-aids or

663
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:37,810
patches that people put in because you

664
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:39,640
see all this also and you see this

665
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:40,629
injection going hanging off the side of

666
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,150
the country

667
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:45,130
and you're like what is this and that's

668
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:46,960
a good place to start and look and go

669
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:49,800
what is going on here because this

670
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:52,930
doesn't look like this should be here

671
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:55,510
and it shouldn't it should have been in

672
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:57,430
that but they just put it that way which

673
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:59,430
usually means hey there's more things

674
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:03,130
for you to look at at this point in time

675
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:06,400
so I typically in the free and buy side

676
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:08,860
of the world Joe Security org is a good

677
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:13,410
class platform hybrid analysis is using

678
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:17,169
falcon on that side IMAS is an android

679
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:19,180
specifically one one of the big things

680
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:23,230
that come up is kind of the innovation

681
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:25,810
side of sandboxing so an teaser is

682
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:27,370
another great one that does DNA and

683
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:29,230
family classification that's really

684
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:30,850
useful for malware because it says hey

685
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:33,640
that we've seen this before and this is

686
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:35,500
the family that's there with but the

687
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:38,170
same thing can be from a DNA

688
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,520
classification for vulnerabilities and

689
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:43,840
some of the other stuff hey we've seen

690
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:46,000
this before and so some of that DNA and

691
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,000
that perspective gives some insight into

692
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,560
binaries and some of the other stuff

693
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,370
there's another one that's in Iran which

694
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:56,639
legitimately is any dot run it's another

695
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:59,020
malware it has probably the best

696
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,610
interaction capability because I don't

697
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:02,320
have to script anything I don't have to

698
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:04,990
let the sandbox do it I can actually

699
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,790
interact the VM at the same time that

700
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:09,070
stuff is there so if I need to click on

701
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:12,490
something or I come to a window that

702
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:15,820
says please enter in the following code

703
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:17,620
a year not left with most Sam boxes

704
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:19,510
we'll get there and go I don't know what

705
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,340
to do I'm waiting for an interaction and

706
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:23,620
there's no way to interact with a lot of

707
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:25,510
the stuff that's there so it hangs up so

708
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,699
you only get like a third of the way

709
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:29,650
through something for it actually

710
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:32,200
running or if I'm trying to look at

711
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:34,810
parsing or some of the other capability

712
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,430
but play adobe is great but guess what

713
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:39,610
it's all about when you open up the PDF

714
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:42,850
not when you just launch it and so

715
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:45,040
that's portion of file open I need that

716
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:47,399
capability the any run product does a

717
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:49,720
great job of pulling that information in

718
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:52,240
allowing you to interact with it and

719
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,770
doing a very nice record of the data

720
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,480
that's actually there providing you with

721
00:31:53,770 --> 00:32:00,760
the details that are actually there

722
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:06,360
along the same lines that's there so one

723
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:08,830
of the other key areas that I like is a

724
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:11,770
static code and people are like well who

725
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:14,020
likes to look at other people's code

726
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:15,850
error cuz some compiler code that people

727
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:19,600
wrote well no one cuz I can tell you no

728
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:24,280
one likes to look at my code but in a

729
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:26,560
lot of cases that it is you you do need

730
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:29,440
to look at things but looking's

731
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:33,340
different and this is one of the things

732
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,950
that unfortunately and in the world of

733
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:39,280
tools the corporation's have an

734
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:43,630
advantage of this that the static code

735
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:46,300
tools are really good with that and they

736
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:49,870
find a lot and the consumer side of it

737
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:52,960
that's their business side of it they

738
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:56,500
find a huge amount of tools that are out

739
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,060
there there's big names brands of it and

740
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,620
they do an awesome job and they have

741
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:06,340
different levels of services that are

742
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:10,629
there but they cost money for a lot of

743
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:18,639
things but if people were actually using

744
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:19,620
them a lot we have a harder time finding

745
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,950
bugs

746
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:26,699
that are there and that's not the case

747
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:31,320
in a lot of cases with that so a lot of

748
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:34,350
times the problem is that these code

749
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:37,080
tools part of the software development

750
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:41,010
lifecycle and everything else we're

751
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:44,340
plugged in after the code base had

752
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:48,120
already been established for a while so

753
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:49,408
maybe you had 50,000 lines of code

754
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:53,370
really small couldn't amount of code

755
00:33:49,409 --> 00:33:56,580
case but out of those 50,000 lines that

756
00:33:53,370 --> 00:34:00,178
there maybe ten thousand lines of code

757
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:03,090
that need to be changed to fix that code

758
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:04,529
base but why because well it was run on

759
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:06,418
Version three

760
00:34:04,529 --> 00:34:09,449
so there were three versions of this to

761
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:11,190
go through and now okay we almost need

762
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:12,928
to rewrite part of the whole app to be

763
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:14,820
able to do it no one wants to do that

764
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:18,179
because they're like hey we need to have

765
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:21,599
version 4 out and the thing so this fix

766
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:23,159
what we want to fix and go back to it so

767
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:26,879
a lot of the things that you start

768
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:28,710
looking at look great on the outside and

769
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,418
everything else and then when you do

770
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:33,899
something on the inside it almost you're

771
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:36,089
like oh my gosh this is crazy and you

772
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:38,279
run into that on time and time again so

773
00:34:36,089 --> 00:34:40,320
I can tell you that these tools are not

774
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,899
lever that has being leveraged and used

775
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,970
and a lot of cycles that are out there

776
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:46,618
they're getting more don't get me wrong

777
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:48,000
they're getting more and more but

778
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:50,399
there's still all this legacy code

779
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,040
that's never going to change never gonna

780
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:56,009
work into these environments that are is

781
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:59,040
is perfectly exploitable that's there

782
00:34:56,010 --> 00:35:00,750
now they do win on the capabilities all

783
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,400
those tools that are out there are

784
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:05,790
definitely out there that's there

785
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:08,490
there's two lists that I like to use a

786
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:15,420
lot of the static code people I like to

787
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:18,060
say that find tools that you're like the

788
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:22,740
output of so some of the tools the

789
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:25,920
output comes out very straightforward

790
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:29,069
other the tools try to be cutesy and hey

791
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:32,510
we were we will add some extra pieces of

792
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:35,120
data from some CVS and some other stuff

793
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:37,280
their tools are like oh we will try to

794
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:39,170
give you some ideas on how to fix it and

795
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:45,110
then other tools are pretty much just

796
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:47,330
raw it's like bad with that so depends

797
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:49,550
on what kind of output you want and and

798
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:51,980
what languages you're trying to process

799
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:54,980
this code in from the source code side

800
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:58,610
of it so sometimes you're dealing with

801
00:35:54,980 --> 00:36:01,190
very very normal classifications other

802
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:03,230
times there's some abstract function

803
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:05,750
that people are writing in that you want

804
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:07,820
to be able to leverage or use well you

805
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:09,770
need to have a static code analysis for

806
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:12,380
portions of that in some of the cases

807
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:14,990
that are there so here's two links that

808
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:16,610
are really good for the tools choose

809
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:19,660
accordingly and choose more than one

810
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:23,150
because again some of the code bases

811
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:25,339
doing too much one some of the things my

812
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:28,820
preferences like I'd rather have a tool

813
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:30,740
that did three separate good languages

814
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:32,990
that are there versus something that's

815
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:36,080
trying to do twenty because at that

816
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:39,859
point in time you're not you're not

817
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:42,440
you're not doing a lot of due diligence

818
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:44,870
on the area you spread yourself way too

819
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:47,990
wide in some of the areas that are there

820
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:51,319
now one of the things that like to do

821
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:55,970
for anything is always look for keywords

822
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:59,420
that are there so finding the key words

823
00:36:55,970 --> 00:37:00,799
typically relates to problem if you see

824
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:02,990
these keywords there could be

825
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,210
potentially this is either a vantage

826
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:06,560
point for you to take a closer look or

827
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:09,530
this is a vantage point that there's a

828
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:11,090
problem that you've just found figuring

829
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:13,430
out how to take advantage of that

830
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:15,410
problem is a different story but things

831
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:19,129
in code that say things like Beiber

832
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:22,220
debug or trace or method equals get or

833
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:24,080
location all those times when you see

834
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:25,370
that you're like okay location means

835
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,920
you're trying to do location and no

836
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:29,690
one's going to shorten that they put it

837
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,070
in the code as hey here's my element

838
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:32,450
that's there so anytime you're popping

839
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:34,760
in the location you're gonna be like oh

840
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:37,399
where are they going to get this how are

841
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,320
they doing this a lot of the same time

842
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,630
same with debug and trace and that is

843
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:43,820
like a lot of the stuff was left in as

844
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:46,220
part of the value as part of their

845
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:48,980
normal process and it's still

846
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:51,919
there so you can take a look at same for

847
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:55,640
a database with executor to lead or

848
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:58,640
queries creating objects getting

849
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:02,060
strengths data adapters the same for

850
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:05,930
input validation hey file reader file

851
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:08,119
writer Java IO file each of these are

852
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:10,399
usually specific that's their the same

853
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:12,950
thing goes for output validation hey if

854
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:17,240
I'm encoding the URL I'm encoding the

855
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:20,240
HTML all those pieces tell me things oh

856
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:22,459
I'm writing a response great des tells

857
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:25,569
me where I want to look for here's file

858
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:27,500
creation at the point same with password

859
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:28,940
and you would figure that would you

860
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,800
everybody would code with something

861
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:32,630
different than past know everybody codes

862
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,840
when uses password as it's the fault

863
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:37,970
with that impersonate get localhost

864
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,920
figure out where you're at here's the

865
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:43,430
host name that I'm looking for the same

866
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:46,910
with session IDs and cookies looking for

867
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:48,680
things HTTP only is one of the best

868
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:50,720
that's like oh man you're killing me

869
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:53,720
with some of this stuff or looking for

870
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,848
SSL okay why would you now if you

871
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:58,250
weren't always encrypted why are you now

872
00:38:55,849 --> 00:39:01,099
changing to encryption what are you

873
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:04,490
about to do that you don't want anybody

874
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:06,380
to see and again look at code and think

875
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:08,598
about it of what's actually being done

876
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:11,540
you don't have to necessarily understand

877
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:13,700
to figure out this but looking at these

878
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:16,279
snippets and finding those very early on

879
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:19,250
are usually the keys to looking and

880
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:21,170
finding where things actually are versus

881
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:23,810
the other side where I started lying one

882
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:27,710
and I get to online 50,000 and I've got

883
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:29,480
a headache and I've I'm just wash

884
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:30,859
because no one really likes looking at

885
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,380
other people code because I don't

886
00:39:30,859 --> 00:39:37,369
understand the method to the madness

887
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:38,810
that's going on so using keywords and

888
00:39:37,369 --> 00:39:41,270
searching for certain of those things

889
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:43,160
whether it's encryption or Eric codes or

890
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:46,040
data transmission gives me the idea that

891
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:48,290
these are important areas that I want to

892
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:50,240
focus in on because this is the

893
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:52,790
likelihood where mistakes have been made

894
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:55,490
that I can take some exploitation around

895
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:57,980
and use and leverage those some of the

896
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:59,540
tools will do this very quickly for you

897
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,170
you can do it yourself

898
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,819
just

899
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:02,930
keyword searching and through some of

900
00:40:01,819 --> 00:40:05,359
these stuff that's actually there

901
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:07,609
whether it be HTML or a regular source

902
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:09,650
code or java javascript in these

903
00:40:07,609 --> 00:40:11,720
environments that are there that are

904
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:14,059
leveraged or used so utilizing keywords

905
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:20,569
are really good as part of the process

906
00:40:14,059 --> 00:40:22,970
that's there now why would I if I

907
00:40:20,569 --> 00:40:26,960
couldn't talk about mobile I would be

908
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:28,578
kind of a shame so there's certain

909
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,920
things I can and cannot talk about as

910
00:40:28,579 --> 00:40:33,470
we're a mobile provider that I don't

911
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:36,589
want to say but as far as mobile

912
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:38,509
everything is an app everything is going

913
00:40:36,589 --> 00:40:40,819
to an app even if it's a stupid web

914
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:43,130
browser that's wrapped as an app it's

915
00:40:40,819 --> 00:40:45,650
still an app people are wanting

916
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:48,109
applications the businesses that are

917
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:51,650
developing applications one application

918
00:40:48,109 --> 00:40:54,290
versus website because it gives them a

919
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:55,579
feeling that they're there so more and

920
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:58,849
more air things are going to

921
00:40:55,579 --> 00:41:02,270
applications that are there commercial

922
00:40:58,849 --> 00:41:06,079
tools really good we use one called now

923
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:09,980
secure that is great at doing all mobile

924
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:12,500
app undoing it to do it correctly you

925
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:14,930
have to be on the hardware that's there

926
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:17,780
which kind of now becomes a barrier to

927
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:19,339
entry to a lot of people because guess

928
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:22,190
what I need to have like six different

929
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:24,440
phones and everything else to be able to

930
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:27,410
do this and have different versions of

931
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:31,280
OS and some of them I need to have six

932
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:32,868
carrier accounts etc because Wi-Fi

933
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,579
doesn't necessarily work all the time

934
00:41:32,869 --> 00:41:39,530
and and so a lot of those things become

935
00:41:36,579 --> 00:41:41,420
problems for a lot of people when they

936
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:44,780
start doing mobile testing and then

937
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:46,400
again having test rigs for aplia for

938
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:48,829
mobile phones is not the easiest thing

939
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,680
to develop and there's a lot of stuff

940
00:41:48,829 --> 00:41:55,240
that's around there so that's one of the

941
00:41:51,680 --> 00:42:00,828
key areas that's there now one of the

942
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:02,799
key things to look for on mobile and the

943
00:42:00,829 --> 00:42:04,730
platforms that are actually there is

944
00:42:02,799 --> 00:42:07,460
look at the server and application

945
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:08,869
checks first place they go for any of

946
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:11,930
these because these are always the ones

947
00:42:08,869 --> 00:42:14,540
that are messed up for lack of a better

948
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:18,180
term because

949
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:19,890
it's two different pieces the server is

950
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:22,020
in the cloud somewhere running

951
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:24,000
application everything else the

952
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:28,530
development team that was developing

953
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,369
that code is not the people on the

954
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:31,200
server side

955
00:42:29,369 --> 00:42:32,880
Dowdell with people developing the app

956
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,439
code or on the app side going hey we're

957
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,599
writing this and we're mobile app

958
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:39,329
developers

959
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:41,250
we're not server or guys that's oh

960
00:42:39,329 --> 00:42:43,200
that's the IT department or that's

961
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:45,359
another group that's actually there and

962
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,910
they're like oh it's in the cloud we

963
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:50,460
just stands this up spit it up put some

964
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:52,140
software on here listen to it and then

965
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:54,030
what are you sending in how are you

966
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:57,569
sending it oh okay we're sending NIST

967
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:58,950
okay good to go easy and unfortunately

968
00:42:57,569 --> 00:43:00,960
that's part of the problem and how does

969
00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:02,640
authentication happen how does a lot of

970
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,920
the other stuff that are there how do I

971
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,379
log into it do I use something uniquely

972
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:09,000
to it is there a captcha portion of this

973
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:10,170
that keeps from brute-forcing what

974
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,339
happens when I send you a hundred

975
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:17,549
thousand requests things along those

976
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:20,460
nature's and oh yes the big thing about

977
00:43:17,549 --> 00:43:24,450
apps that a lot of people don't know is

978
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:27,030
that I have to support old versions it's

979
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:29,220
not like a website where I just fixed

980
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:33,900
the server and everybody's automatically

981
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:35,939
upgraded the applications it's up to you

982
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:38,520
going and saying yes go ahead and do

983
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:40,500
updates and it's like yes yes yes yes

984
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,180
yes or if I change my permissions follow

985
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:44,309
the privacy statements any number of

986
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:47,700
things can keep you from actually

987
00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:49,680
upgrading one of these or you just never

988
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:51,029
download the new ones and you tell you

989
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,549
told it I hey I don't want to ever

990
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:55,680
upgrade my apps that are there well it

991
00:43:53,549 --> 00:43:58,410
has to work with that application so

992
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:00,419
that's portion of the server side that

993
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:02,578
has this problem where I've got to

994
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:04,890
operate on all these different variants

995
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:07,670
even if I break something I cannot not

996
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:11,009
have it talked to me in a lot of cases

997
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:14,040
so those are issues that on the server

998
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:16,670
side are they are the easy ones to

999
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:19,109
actually find in a lot of the areas

1000
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:21,000
transportation layers and ciphers so

1001
00:44:19,109 --> 00:44:22,619
many times you've seen so many talks and

1002
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,960
I'm sure there'll be more thoughts of

1003
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:26,830
this of how hey something's not

1004
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,620
encrypted being sent where

1005
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:31,420
it's GPS locations authentication other

1006
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:32,109
things it's getting better and better

1007
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:34,300
and better

1008
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:35,260
but there's so many things they're still

1009
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:37,570
left

1010
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:39,490
non-encrypted oh they'll they'll do it

1011
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:41,230
and a lot of people are like why in the

1012
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:44,009
world of dealing with the world where

1013
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:46,720
everything's going encrypted and to end

1014
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:48,520
around this are there applications still

1015
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:51,129
to this date that's there and it's part

1016
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:54,009
of the it's part of the battery life

1017
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:57,250
it's part of the CPU utilization of the

1018
00:44:54,010 --> 00:45:01,000
device along those that there was an old

1019
00:44:57,250 --> 00:45:03,040
idea that hey these were kind of fragile

1020
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,950
devices didn't have a lot of horsepower

1021
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:10,029
and if I encrypt everything I uh call my

1022
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:13,839
battery down and that does happen or if

1023
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:17,110
I if I everything I'm now impacting the

1024
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:19,990
performance of my device and yeah that

1025
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:21,340
happens too but it's secure so a lot of

1026
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:23,410
times they're there trying to balance

1027
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:27,280
that performance with security side

1028
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:30,250
that's actually their business logic

1029
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:33,010
rules are really good to exploit in

1030
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:35,470
applications and the reason why they're

1031
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:37,330
so good exploit on application side of

1032
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:40,750
it is they're typically the same rules

1033
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:44,500
that were set up for wept and it's not

1034
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:46,450
the same logic and so a lot of times of

1035
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,950
like how do I reset the account and most

1036
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:49,569
the time you hit on the reset button and

1037
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:52,660
it's like it'll click out and they will

1038
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:54,460
send an email woohoo

1039
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:56,399
and so you see all these different

1040
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:58,720
things that are really designed around

1041
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,460
hey this is the same way we did it on

1042
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:03,459
the web so why can't we do it this way

1043
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:05,590
on the application and those are very

1044
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:07,720
good around that the same thing for like

1045
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:09,850
brute force is like oh wait we have a

1046
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:11,439
captcha sitting up here so if you start

1047
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:13,569
banging on this we're gonna come back at

1048
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,850
you and make you type something in well

1049
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:19,570
how do you do that on your application

1050
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:21,460
and do you do stop it do you not stop it

1051
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:23,680
how do you do that and those are those

1052
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:26,020
are things that are not thought through

1053
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,440
same with permissions of what

1054
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:31,810
permissions do I need versus what

1055
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:33,490
permissions do I want first the what

1056
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:37,240
commissions are actually the app

1057
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:38,589
actually has so they're the security we

1058
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,029
always know who with hey lease

1059
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:42,560
privileged

1060
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:45,050
applications unfortunately is most the

1061
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,700
time they're like well most privileged

1062
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:49,070
and then we'll cut ourselves back if

1063
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:51,529
people yell at us or we wonder why

1064
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:53,450
things and a lot of times the privileges

1065
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:57,500
it used to be in the old days these were

1066
00:46:53,450 --> 00:47:00,230
really badly done it's like hey I need

1067
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:02,720
to be able to read and write files and

1068
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:03,890
you're like oh no and I was like well

1069
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,810
how do you expect me to take a

1070
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:08,089
photograph and not write it to your

1071
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:10,340
thing oh okay that's what you're doing

1072
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:12,530
so they weren't really specific but so

1073
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:14,630
many applications now go out and get

1074
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:17,630
these large-scale permissions just

1075
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:20,060
because they're either develop poorly

1076
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:22,910
that's a usually a key sign if you have

1077
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:25,190
really bad development environment they

1078
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:28,339
will ask for a lot of overreaching

1079
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:29,990
permissions or your malware you'll ask

1080
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:31,550
for overreaching permissions because you

1081
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:33,680
don't understand how to make this work

1082
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:35,540
the way you need it to work without

1083
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,770
doing the permissions or you're not in a

1084
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:39,580
mobile development you're just in a

1085
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:44,000
regular development shop that are there

1086
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:47,509
a lot of times code issues are pretty

1087
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,970
much normal code issues that are around

1088
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:52,670
there input validation other things

1089
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:54,649
there around that functions that are

1090
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:56,990
their memory and storage is really good

1091
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:58,340
to play with because a lot of times they

1092
00:47:56,990 --> 00:48:01,959
it's not something that's really

1093
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:05,960
understood by the application owners are

1094
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:07,580
builders because most of this is stored

1095
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:10,070
in a sequel like database at least on

1096
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:12,380
the Android side of it or other

1097
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:14,119
databases they're there but I sometimes

1098
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:16,310
they're stored in clear text sometimes

1099
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:18,140
they're stored and they're not removed

1100
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:20,240
so they're stored and left in logs

1101
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:21,859
they're stored in left in cache so when

1102
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,930
I connect to something I'm like here's

1103
00:48:21,859 --> 00:48:25,279
my log file of all my connections and oh

1104
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:27,980
yeah here's the username and password

1105
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,550
that's in the log file or here's my

1106
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:34,580
things that are in cache that stay there

1107
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:37,850
now does it change doesn't do it a lot

1108
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:39,920
of times things are in a debug mode when

1109
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:41,270
people are looking for things and then

1110
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,190
they're produced and they're still in

1111
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:46,100
debug mode someone never turned it off

1112
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:48,980
that's their information stored in the

1113
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:52,430
clear when they crash they dump

1114
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:54,050
everything around that and and some of

1115
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:56,810
the other stuff that's there

1116
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:59,570
one of the key things to remember though

1117
00:48:56,810 --> 00:49:01,369
is that when you start messing with

1118
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:06,560
applications or actually messing with

1119
00:49:01,369 --> 00:49:08,680
the iOS or the Android functions that

1120
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:11,090
are there for the software side of it

1121
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:11,779
you can break stuff and it don't work

1122
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:17,330
anymore

1123
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:19,550
really so sometimes you can revert back

1124
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:21,319
to it and other times it takes a lot to

1125
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:24,920
revert back to it and sometimes it's

1126
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:26,240
just never going to come back so I tell

1127
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,100
people please start

1128
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:30,169
if you starting in the world of mobile

1129
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:33,319
apps and you want to beat on something

1130
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:37,160
buy you stuff buy stuff that's cheap

1131
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:39,110
versus expensive stuff because things

1132
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:43,549
will break and you will blow things up

1133
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:46,970
and it will not come back and you will

1134
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:49,550
be sad at the phone that's there that as

1135
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:53,270
you see it's just every way you powered

1136
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:56,150
on it powers itself off so that's one of

1137
00:49:53,270 --> 00:50:02,600
the other areas that are there that's

1138
00:49:56,150 --> 00:50:06,260
around that um IOT devices so IOT is one

1139
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:11,660
of these areas brand-new stuff but it's

1140
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:14,420
also cool stuff so it's all about the

1141
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:17,210
device in the world of IOT and what I

1142
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:20,480
mean by the device is is finding what

1143
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:22,880
you're trying to look for remember that

1144
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:25,130
these devices are designed typically to

1145
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:28,040
be cheap and replaceable and easy to use

1146
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:31,430
which for us hey this is a great

1147
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:35,080
opportunity because cheap easy to use

1148
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:39,220
usually does not go well with security

1149
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:42,890
so part of that way that you look for is

1150
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:47,480
typically a kind of for different areas

1151
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:50,150
to do exploitation on these IOT devices

1152
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:52,609
in and they kind of like open them up

1153
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:55,070
for that one is the firmware you don't

1154
00:50:52,609 --> 00:50:57,230
even need the IOT device if you get the

1155
00:50:55,070 --> 00:51:00,830
firmware with that sometimes the

1156
00:50:57,230 --> 00:51:05,150
firmware is encrypted which sorry

1157
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:06,860
it's encrypted your stock at this find

1158
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:08,450
another device typically

1159
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:10,070
that you're not gonna necessarily

1160
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:11,660
brute-force encryption you're not going

1161
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:14,390
to necessarily get the keys they're not

1162
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:16,240
it just makes things really really

1163
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:20,420
difficult it doesn't make it any more

1164
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:24,020
secure it just makes finding it a much

1165
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:25,580
more pain in the butt to actually do if

1166
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:27,650
you look at the non encrypted version

1167
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:31,100
you need to extract it analyze the

1168
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:33,320
firmware look for common exploits the

1169
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:36,490
standard thing it's code understand

1170
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:39,470
what's there look for backdoors

1171
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:42,319
connectivity other things that are all

1172
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:44,629
there Springs passwords other things

1173
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:46,220
that make sense when you start looking

1174
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:49,270
at this stuff that you're like oh I

1175
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:51,680
found something here that's there you

1176
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:54,890
can get it through other ways like

1177
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:57,890
support sides call people ups and email

1178
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:59,509
off I need to reset this device how am I

1179
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:01,370
going to reset these tools and

1180
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:04,460
everything else those are all common

1181
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:06,140
steps that you can typically get and you

1182
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:11,360
can get some additional pieces of that

1183
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:13,700
Hardware figuring out what it is FCC ID

1184
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:16,160
you can usually typically look on the ID

1185
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:17,540
on that you can get it's got a barcode

1186
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,460
number

1187
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:22,370
registration number with it that tells

1188
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:25,010
you what it is or how it's registered

1189
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:26,630
and that Google usually has some

1190
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:28,460
information on that side of the MAC

1191
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:33,200
address we'll give you the manufacturer

1192
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:35,870
at least the interfaces that around that

1193
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:39,649
and again looking at supports and

1194
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:41,210
functionalities that's there I'm a

1195
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:42,770
proponent they're cheap and easy that

1196
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:45,320
means I can buy more than one and I can

1197
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:47,600
open them up even if it tends to violate

1198
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:49,070
the warranty at some point in time and

1199
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:51,230
we won't discuss other legal

1200
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:55,400
ramifications about opening up devices

1201
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:57,830
but this there the screws were hidden

1202
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:01,060
nine times out of ten under rubber pads

1203
00:52:57,830 --> 00:53:03,710
I always say use a lighter and a big pin

1204
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:06,470
simply do the fact that you can make any

1205
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:08,240
screwdriver that you want to by melting

1206
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:11,959
the end of the big pin and inserting it

1207
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:15,439
onto a screw do not do this at home or

1208
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:17,510
use at your own risk but opening up will

1209
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,660
give you access to the PC board which

1210
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:22,849
now you can look for slots enabled slaw

1211
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:25,848
it's everything else from a hardware

1212
00:53:22,849 --> 00:53:28,309
standpoint there's a lot of things that

1213
00:53:25,849 --> 00:53:30,710
I can do on the hardware side in other

1214
00:53:28,309 --> 00:53:33,470
words I can disable ports I can not

1215
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:36,020
enable stuff so even if you find a USB

1216
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:38,118
port that something's plug into doesn't

1217
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:41,180
mean that it's turned on and enabled by

1218
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:43,220
the software and so a lot of those

1219
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:46,160
things that are built sometimes have

1220
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:48,288
those areas that are there so look for

1221
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:50,390
empty slots look for empty connectors

1222
00:53:48,289 --> 00:53:52,369
chips that are supposed to be there you

1223
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:55,250
need a little bit of Electrical

1224
00:53:52,369 --> 00:53:56,930
Engineering and other types of things to

1225
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:58,869
look for these connectors and understand

1226
00:53:56,930 --> 00:54:01,669
stuff but if you open up enough boards

1227
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:03,829
you start understanding hey I've seen

1228
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:06,230
this chip before this is memory this is

1229
00:54:03,829 --> 00:54:08,559
flash okay good okay there's some

1230
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:11,359
there's my firmware etc with that

1231
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:14,990
looking for things like JTAG known chip

1232
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:19,609
connectors known known ribbon connectors

1233
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:23,180
how things are being done known network

1234
00:54:19,609 --> 00:54:24,890
function so hey is it Wi-Fi Bluetooth is

1235
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:26,720
it just Bluetooth is it something else

1236
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:28,368
that's all and the thing is they're near

1237
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,899
field communications part of this

1238
00:54:28,369 --> 00:54:32,809
there's all these different functions

1239
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:35,299
that you can find out just by looking at

1240
00:54:32,809 --> 00:54:37,730
these components because that provides

1241
00:54:35,299 --> 00:54:39,589
you the other next areas of Wow now that

1242
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:42,799
I want to get there how's this device

1243
00:54:39,589 --> 00:54:44,900
working okay I have connection and setup

1244
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:47,210
around that is it a mobile lab do i

1245
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:49,339
connect to it do i unset up do i have to

1246
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:52,700
be near it does it find it when it's

1247
00:54:49,339 --> 00:54:54,109
near those kind of things is it looking

1248
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:55,640
for it because it's connected to the

1249
00:54:54,109 --> 00:54:58,750
same network is it looking for it

1250
00:54:55,640 --> 00:55:02,058
because it's broadcasting a new ID

1251
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:04,849
that's there how does that find the

1252
00:55:02,059 --> 00:55:06,950
device how does the app start on square

1253
00:55:04,849 --> 00:55:08,809
one with connecting and targeting that

1254
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:10,819
device because those key elements that

1255
00:55:08,809 --> 00:55:13,309
you once you find that you should always

1256
00:55:10,819 --> 00:55:16,339
record the network traffic of that now

1257
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:17,990
you get into this oh now I see how this

1258
00:55:16,339 --> 00:55:20,270
is finding it now I see how it's working

1259
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:23,089
and now I see what it it's on there is

1260
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:24,770
it using known protocols universal plug

1261
00:55:23,089 --> 00:55:27,230
and play and some of the other ones that

1262
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:29,480
I can use potential exploitation because

1263
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:31,640
the service that's running on that each

1264
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,170
one of those things provides kind of the

1265
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,910
next

1266
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:35,710
learning or a stepping-stone that gets

1267
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:39,879
me to the next level that's actually

1268
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:42,579
there you can have oh its configured via

1269
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:46,210
web interface oh okay so how is it

1270
00:55:42,579 --> 00:55:49,089
configured is it set up for HTTP is it

1271
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:51,010
configured for secure does it go to a

1272
00:55:49,089 --> 00:55:54,279
secure standard or if it goes to secure

1273
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:55,660
can I do it in securely all those

1274
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:57,130
different things that are around there

1275
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:59,410
look at the network traffic because it

1276
00:55:57,130 --> 00:56:00,940
provides different pieces of it you can

1277
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:02,680
use things like tools like Wireshark

1278
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:04,240
since you're connecting on local side of

1279
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:06,308
it you can connect all they'll find all

1280
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:08,558
the data easy to do

1281
00:56:06,309 --> 00:56:11,309
same with Android there's D capture and

1282
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:15,010
some of the other ones which it spins up

1283
00:56:11,309 --> 00:56:17,490
basically a VPN sim port and then sends

1284
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:20,950
all the data to a file that's they're

1285
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:23,410
looking at clients api's so and maybe it

1286
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:25,930
requires a client to be downloaded or an

1287
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:27,399
app to be downloaded on your PC those

1288
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:29,589
are even better because there's like

1289
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:32,079
okay there's a trust issue with the

1290
00:56:29,589 --> 00:56:35,650
client and the server on the other side

1291
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:37,540
and so it's like oh well what do I do a

1292
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:39,339
secret handshake do I do some other

1293
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:41,380
things that are around some of those

1294
00:56:39,339 --> 00:56:43,420
areas and some of that actually comes

1295
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:45,940
into some of those that are there the

1296
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:50,530
same with the radio is a Wi-Fi Bluetooth

1297
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:52,690
near-field Bluetooth ZigBee using SD

1298
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:54,819
ours to find the data looking how its

1299
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:56,829
talking around this again there's

1300
00:56:54,819 --> 00:56:58,660
expenses associated with that and many

1301
00:56:56,829 --> 00:57:01,030
times you don't necessarily have to go

1302
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:05,230
under to the radio side to figure out

1303
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:07,240
how things are set up now I'm dealing

1304
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:09,309
with hardware kind of have some of the

1305
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:12,189
same focus you need to know some things

1306
00:57:09,309 --> 00:57:15,190
about electronics to understand how

1307
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:19,000
things are there to be able to exploit

1308
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:21,160
but it may provide links to the software

1309
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:24,069
side because it's not just all the

1310
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:26,020
hardware it software running on that so

1311
00:57:24,069 --> 00:57:28,180
what software and how is it running and

1312
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:30,970
how is it talking is imperative to that

1313
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:33,970
I always tell people okay go talk to

1314
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:35,589
people at the hardware labs at a lot of

1315
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:38,770
the cons where you have a lot of people

1316
00:57:35,589 --> 00:57:40,869
doing really cool hardware stuff usually

1317
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:43,809
the badges and some of the other people

1318
00:57:40,869 --> 00:57:46,430
just bring up stuff find out weird

1319
00:57:43,809 --> 00:57:49,490
things sites websites they looked at

1320
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:51,440
how would you find the ship and some of

1321
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:54,740
the other stuff and they can have some

1322
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:56,900
great ideas behind things that are there

1323
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:58,368
we're no longer in the world where I

1324
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:00,980
come from the world where they would

1325
00:57:58,369 --> 00:58:02,930
literally take PC boards and rook them

1326
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:05,599
in epoxy so that you could not see the

1327
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:07,220
board layout and you could not see the

1328
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:10,640
chips that were actually being used

1329
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:12,859
that's gone away because it's cussed so

1330
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:15,259
hardware is becoming cheaper and yes

1331
00:58:12,859 --> 00:58:18,200
most the time you can brutally open the

1332
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:20,029
boards the chips are not washed off so

1333
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:22,250
you can't tell what they actually are

1334
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:23,930
anything else all the stuff is just

1335
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:26,569
there because it's all contract based

1336
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:28,520
manufacturing in a lot of cases again

1337
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:30,558
hardware is same thing firmware

1338
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:32,480
operating systems that are there and

1339
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:35,299
remember when it's on a hardware device

1340
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:38,059
it's never updated and I literally mean

1341
00:58:35,299 --> 00:58:40,700
that many of these devices never go out

1342
00:58:38,059 --> 00:58:42,380
and download new updates when they're

1343
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:44,960
starting to work IOT devices are a

1344
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:47,270
little different hardware stuff no it's

1345
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:50,569
still running this ancient version of

1346
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:53,210
Windows Embedded 8.1 in some of the

1347
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:55,130
cases so just remember that on a lot of

1348
00:58:53,210 --> 00:58:57,109
cases so there's a lot of areas that are

1349
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:59,270
there specifically around hardware you

1350
00:58:57,109 --> 00:59:01,490
got to do it a lot of these things low

1351
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:03,950
level protocols that are being used to

1352
00:59:01,490 --> 00:59:05,720
share and Traverse dia typically are

1353
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:07,038
never designed for any kind of

1354
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:09,049
authentication they were never designed

1355
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:11,990
to be connected a lot of the stuff is

1356
00:59:09,049 --> 00:59:14,119
how old this hardware actually is where

1357
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:16,308
is this hardware originated at is it

1358
00:59:14,119 --> 00:59:18,410
something new that's bolt on in a lot of

1359
00:59:16,309 --> 00:59:20,420
cases TVs are a great example of a bolt

1360
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:23,000
on hardware or is there basically hey it

1361
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:25,430
used to be a TV you plug cable in hey it

1362
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,770
showed a picture now it's like hey we

1363
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:29,390
have Netflix apps we have Hulu HAP's we

1364
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:31,640
have all these apps that are basically a

1365
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:34,069
board that's plugged into the TV that

1366
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:36,288
goes okay here's how we do this and so

1367
00:59:34,069 --> 00:59:39,558
in that bolt on you know those two

1368
00:59:36,289 --> 00:59:41,720
systems don't necessarily communicate at

1369
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:44,119
certain levels so focus on the system

1370
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:45,890
that is the bolt on component of that

1371
00:59:44,119 --> 00:59:49,279
not basically something that's been

1372
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:52,960
manufactured around that the commercial

1373
00:59:49,279 --> 00:59:56,359
side of it is the same thing of

1374
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:58,039
encryption apps replay attack say if I

1375
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:59,840
something worked once it will always

1376
00:59:58,039 --> 01:00:02,600
usually work again and fortune

1377
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:04,670
like timeouts are always key if I'm

1378
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:07,819
authenticated when do I not get us

1379
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:09,470
indicated anymore a lot of times it's

1380
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:13,820
like once you get off indicated you're

1381
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:15,529
authenticated forever which is good now

1382
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:17,480
I just need to find out how that works

1383
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:21,320
so and the same thing goes for web

1384
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:24,050
permission bugs injections configuration

1385
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:26,210
startups are all parts of that because

1386
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:28,490
those are key when it's not when it

1387
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:31,160
knows nothing how does it learn

1388
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:33,020
everything and how is it going to

1389
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:35,330
configure and that's an easy way to go

1390
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:37,580
in and dive into some of these things

1391
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:41,060
network service is again going with the

1392
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:43,910
hardware always updated always buggy

1393
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:45,980
always not working very well a lot of

1394
01:00:43,910 --> 01:00:49,220
times brute-forcing does wonders for

1395
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:51,050
this clients are still the same thing

1396
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:52,910
trusting api's and current connections

1397
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:55,040
that are around there

1398
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:59,120
choose cheap hardware expensive hardware

1399
01:00:55,040 --> 01:01:01,580
socks because when you break it you

1400
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:03,380
you're like it's not a toaster you're

1401
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:06,529
like okay now I need to go buy another

1402
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:08,150
one in a lot of cases that are there so

1403
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:10,220
I would like to thank everyone

1404
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:14,840
especially bugcrowd and the rest of the

1405
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:16,850
folks on that side of it so I'm glad I

1406
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:19,790
was able to present and everything else

1407
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:22,000
and hope some folks got a little bit of

1408
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:24,410
information around it thanks again guys

1409
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,050
thank you so much Richard I really

1410
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:28,759
appreciate you giving such a great and

1411
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:32,140
thorough talk for the community thank

1412
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:36,440
you so much my pleasure

1413
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:38,660
all right so we will get our next

1414
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:41,690
speaker set up here if you have any

1415
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:45,680
questions for Richard please feel free

1416
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:48,980
to tweet at him he's at SEC rich SEC

1417
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:50,930
rich on Twitter and also tweet at

1418
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:52,390
bugcrowd using hashtag it takes a crowd

1419
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:54,620
that's where we have all the

1420
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:56,870
conversation for level up up there on

1421
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:58,520
Twitter but yeah thank you so much

1422
01:01:56,870 --> 01:02:00,380
Richard I really appreciate it my

1423
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:02,540
pleasure I'll be hanging out in the

1424
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:05,240
twitch stream for a little bit so if you

1425
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:06,950
need anything feel free to step up on

1426
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:11,950
that side of it so thanks again

1427
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:11,950
I really enjoyed awesome thank you
