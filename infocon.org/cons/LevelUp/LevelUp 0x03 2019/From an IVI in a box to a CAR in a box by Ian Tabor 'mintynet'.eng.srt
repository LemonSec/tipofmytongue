1
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:11,180
okay hi I'm in teh war this is my talk

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:16,060
from our IV ina box too

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:16,059
box first things first

4
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:25,060
yeah my well my current day job is

5
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:28,788
network security architect type role and

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:32,210
however you could say I'm a the ultimate

7
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:35,270
car hacker I booked this cut kick off 14

8
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:39,170
years ago now out of lots of parts of

9
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:41,480
different Ford vehicles it's a labor of

10
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:44,960
love it's been upgraded numerous times

11
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:49,430
it's pretty quick it only has three ECU

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,140
to which I have built and that's how I

13
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:57,829
built actually communicate over canvas

14
00:00:51,140 --> 00:01:01,820
for data logging purposes so onto my

15
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:04,119
only car hacking history so previously

16
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:10,820
found a vulnerability in a car I owned

17
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:14,930
its Citroen ds5 and I have previously

18
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:17,149
presented those findings last year with

19
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:19,100
my talk web browsing from a car what's

20
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:22,400
the worst that can happen

21
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:24,860
presented at a DC 44:20 Eastside London

22
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,060
rookie track and also the DEF CON car

23
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,780
hacking village itself

24
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:32,030
last year the end of last year I was

25
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,189
lucky enough to be one of twelve car

26
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:38,540
hackers invited to the bugcrowd

27
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:40,508
live a bash in Louisville with a actual

28
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,799
winner who let us play with their cars I

29
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:46,180
can't actually go into any more details

30
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,860
than that because we're not allowed but

31
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:51,200
that's quite interesting so on to the

32
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:55,549
actual vulnerability I found brief

33
00:01:51,200 --> 00:02:00,439
history my 2015 I bought this vehicle

34
00:01:55,549 --> 00:02:01,520
ds5 1955 limited edition had all the

35
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:04,158
bells and whistles all the toys

36
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,740
including a seven-inch touchscreen which

37
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,030
you could surf the internet from as long

38
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,000
as you tethered through Wi-Fi or

39
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:12,950
Bluetooth which is great however the

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,049
problem was if you actually were on the

41
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:17,750
same Wi-Fi or Bluetooth you could tone

42
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:19,609
it back to the vehicle get into the head

43
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:22,130
unit without any authentication

44
00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:24,680
and find out your GPS and telephone

45
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:28,280
telephone history including all your

46
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,390
contacts etc etc nice and secure I then

47
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,850
raised that issue

48
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:34,339
the vendor in question they then came

49
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:36,739
back and said it's up to the users to

50
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,330
secure their own Wi-Fi but in future

51
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,770
models we'll probably just kill the

52
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:45,440
Wi-Fi version anyway because we don't

53
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:49,220
see as a requirement so at the time I

54
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,450
saw the vehicle and I thought can I

55
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,450
actually get any further than just

56
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:59,810
turning onto the own head unit is was

57
00:02:53,450 --> 00:03:02,239
there any way of going from the Wi-Fi IP

58
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:04,459
network onto the campus so I went and

59
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:08,810
purchased a head unit from a scrap yard

60
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:12,560
from ds3 from the same year had all the

61
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:15,020
same setup allegedly with Wi-Fi and

62
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,239
Bluetooth you could surf internet on it

63
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:19,489
and when I purchased it the man be a man

64
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,170
in scrap yard said you'll never get that

65
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:24,739
working without the rest at all so

66
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:26,660
challenge accepted and as you can see on

67
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:28,489
the picture here there is all the other

68
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,400
parts of the rest of the car you need to

69
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:34,220
get working including the body control

70
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,860
module here instrument cluster the

71
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,510
steering controls ignition key don't

72
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:43,700
actually movie to you but I did have it

73
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:45,410
at the time so that was what was

74
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,410
required to actually get the head unit

75
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,940
working out of the vehicle and the

76
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:52,790
challenge was could I get it working

77
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:55,880
without the rest of the car so I did a

78
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:59,090
bit of a canvass sniffing managed to

79
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:01,579
sniff the correct messages replay them

80
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:04,130
found out those five messages required

81
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,959
and created a little sketch on an

82
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:08,959
Arduino with the relevant canvas

83
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:12,320
transceiver and created a little own ivi

84
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,900
in a box I have taken this to a few

85
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,418
conferences other people have expressed

86
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,850
interest in trying to hack this and see

87
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:21,560
what they can do with their skills but

88
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,840
because of time constraints and things

89
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:29,090
they haven't actually managed to do that

90
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:31,909
that things will happen soon so as I had

91
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:34,609
as I had quite a large portion of the

92
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:37,640
components from within a vehicle I

93
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,270
thought I'd make a corner bench this is

94
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,390
grins

95
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:43,430
Threepio which is based on I believe a

96
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:45,289
2012 Ford Focus

97
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:48,560
and they've got minimal wiring between

98
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:50,509
their modules and basically all modules

99
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,240
sit there dumb and you can interact with

100
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:55,490
them but the car doesn't actually work

101
00:04:53,240 --> 00:05:01,460
as a car so there's nobody no engine

102
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:04,449
running etc etc so from then on end of

103
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:10,520
last year I went to the bug bash and

104
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:12,259
myself the specters and rqu found a p1

105
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,889
vulnerability and managed to share

106
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:17,919
between us a five figure payout so with

107
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:21,260
that money that I wasn't expecting I

108
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:25,280
decided to instead of having a car on a

109
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:26,930
bench I'd make a car in a box but the

110
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,448
thought being that this car in a box

111
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,160
will be taken to security conferences to

112
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:33,560
get other people into car hacking

113
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,840
without the risk of potentially them

114
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,820
breaking their own car if you've ever

115
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,229
done car hacking sitting outside the

116
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,300
front of your house with a bright laptop

117
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:43,758
sniffing clan messages get some very

118
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,380
strange looks from neighbors and if

119
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,610
you're anything like me the last time I

120
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:52,460
did it on my daily driver I brick the

121
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:54,370
manage to brick the gearbox and the car

122
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,900
didn't know where the gearbox was

123
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:58,099
luckily I managed to get it back but

124
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:03,919
that would have been a very difficult

125
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:07,250
conversation when it comes to getting

126
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,380
the car back on the road so Carl hacking

127
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:12,110
a bit like lock-picking I only do it to

128
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:16,630
something you don't rely on and also

129
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:19,250
only do it to your thing so with the

130
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:21,110
thought of the car in the box I then had

131
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,810
to purchase all these other components

132
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:25,550
shown here to actually have the rest of

133
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:28,220
the vehicle so there's a steering rack

134
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:32,419
ECU main fuse box

135
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:33,710
ABS ECU pedal strata body and the rest

136
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:35,539
of the component some of the rest of

137
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:38,120
these components already had I also had

138
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:40,070
to buy quite a lot of sensors so I could

139
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,880
work out how those sensors work and how

140
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:47,389
those how I could emulate those sensors

141
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,909
and this will cost money I will come to

142
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:53,960
the costs in the end but before we can

143
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:55,400
work out how how to do how to emulate

144
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,599
sense you need to work out how the

145
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,179
wiring works

146
00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:03,229
this here is the wiring diagram for my

147
00:06:59,179 --> 00:07:05,179
kit cause main ECU there is a DB 37

148
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:07,998
connector of which 15 wires are

149
00:07:05,179 --> 00:07:11,539
connected six of those the ground that

150
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:14,300
car uses is forcing the wasted spark or

151
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:17,509
wack batch injection with two pairs of

152
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,889
two injectors single o2 sensor a couple

153
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:22,330
of other sensors for throttle position

154
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:25,849
air intake coolant temperature etc etc

155
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:28,099
and there's not really much to when it

156
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:30,830
comes to the car that I had the parts

157
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:32,899
from herder to eight this is one of the

158
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:37,039
wiring diagrams this is actually the

159
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:40,699
wiring diagram for the ECU this has 253

160
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:44,419
pin connectors and 132 pin connector so

161
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:46,129
that's potentially 138 pins the reason

162
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:48,339
why it's more complicated is because

163
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:51,379
it's three cylinder sequential injection

164
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:53,959
coil on plug joule o2 sensor joule

165
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:55,999
barrel variable valve timing with dual

166
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:57,469
cam sensors and then it's got all the

167
00:07:55,999 --> 00:08:00,229
rest of the relevant sensors you would

168
00:07:57,469 --> 00:08:03,529
expect it to have for all position

169
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:07,159
sensor electronic pedal manifold air

170
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:11,749
pressure so quite a lot of these sensors

171
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:13,759
i had to in emulate and there are also

172
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:16,939
lots of other wiring Argon's I had to

173
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,499
get hold of to work out how to get

174
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:19,789
things like lights working because there

175
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:22,449
was no way in the world I was going to

176
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:26,058
put the light clusters in the vehicle

177
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:29,269
but the hardest one our hardest ones to

178
00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:31,909
actually emulate is the AC the engine

179
00:08:29,269 --> 00:08:33,740
thinking it's rotating to do this you

180
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:39,049
have to know how the crank and cam

181
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:41,000
signals work pojos in general actually

182
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:44,029
use what is known as sixty minus one

183
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,920
crank sensor and they use two cam

184
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:47,660
sensors which are located at the

185
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,880
right-hand end of the two cam shafts

186
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:54,380
here and you have to work out what that

187
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:56,060
signal is to be able to emulate it you

188
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:59,540
also have to remember that the crank

189
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:04,670
turns twice for every twice very full

190
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:06,589
rotation of a cam shaft found a bit of

191
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:10,040
software on the internet called audio

192
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:11,750
stim which uses an Arduino and

193
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,540
some of the transistors to generate

194
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,640
these waveforms to fully ECU into

195
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,699
thinking it's working there is also a

196
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,010
potentiometer on there so you can vary

197
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:24,530
the speed of the engine and once this

198
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:27,319
was all built and vibin it actually

199
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:29,240
thought the engine was running there are

200
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:34,600
some other sensors that are require

201
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:37,910
waveform type things to work correctly

202
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:40,100
one of which is the o2 sensor there is a

203
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:44,810
couple of five five five timers in there

204
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:48,230
which are used for generating with the

205
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:51,640
relevant co2 sensor information so

206
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:57,590
detects it it's either lean or rich or

207
00:09:51,640 --> 00:10:02,300
in a sort of waveform so on to the next

208
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:07,190
slide here is the details of the actual

209
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:09,530
can networks on the vehicle itself or

210
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:11,840
the car in the box on the left-hand side

211
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:14,420
we have the red and orange which is your

212
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,790
normal obd2 port running at 500 kilobits

213
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:19,430
per second you've got the body control

214
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:24,560
module which controls things like your

215
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:28,010
lights some of the switches on the

216
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:31,540
dashboard etc got the ABS ESP module

217
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:33,650
power steering and your engine ECU

218
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:38,780
attached to the body control module on

219
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:41,150
top of that is there - low-speed canvas

220
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:43,490
is shown here in yellow on green and two

221
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:45,680
shades of blue yellow and green one

222
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:48,710
itself has the steering control we see

223
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:52,520
you where your indicator stalks and your

224
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:55,400
lighting switches etc are there's also

225
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:57,650
the airbag ECU which is not available in

226
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,569
the partner box because there was no way

227
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:01,970
I was putting a class on explosive in

228
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:03,920
the back of my car and I'm taking around

229
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,500
to conferences to let other people to

230
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,949
try and set off stead car and class when

231
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:13,040
explosives at the conference because

232
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:14,600
it's a bit dodgy and airbag ECU's are

233
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,530
actually very expensive to purchase

234
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:22,430
themself onto the second of the

235
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:23,750
low-speed campuses there is the one that

236
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,339
has the instrument class

237
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,680
the matrix within the instrument cluster

238
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:31,700
which shows you things like speed miles

239
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:34,849
per gallon and GPS information and

240
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:40,460
finally the IUI itself there is a fourth

241
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:43,340
high speed and thus on the car in the

242
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:46,550
box but that only goes between the ivi

243
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:51,140
and the screen of the ivi and that is

244
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:54,290
for the touchscreen to actually work so

245
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:55,850
now we're going on to the actual car in

246
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:58,000
a box this is the core inner box

247
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:01,430
there's the little box which is the

248
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,780
either on a box and the big box which is

249
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:07,910
the coroner box it's known as pdi-p

250
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:11,720
meeting team indicating Peugeot do

251
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:18,740
indicating 2:08 and hex is that sequence

252
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:21,530
from there's the IV I open as you've

253
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:24,980
seen before and there are the two parts

254
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:26,439
of the coroner box let me just go

255
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:30,230
through some of the things on the screen

256
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:33,280
on the left hand corner here is a little

257
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:35,780
blue box which is the RG system which is

258
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,939
simulating the crank and can waveforms

259
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:41,510
there is potential later on there which

260
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:43,730
allows you to modify the speed of the

261
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:48,950
engine if you look on the right hand

262
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:51,560
side there is the rev counter on the

263
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:53,600
left hand side of the cluster looks like

264
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:56,839
he's going about 3,000 rpm at the moment

265
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,300
that can be adjusted anything from 0 up

266
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:05,120
to 8,000 rpm however the clock stopped

267
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:07,849
at 7 other indicators on here is some

268
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:11,780
LEDs for the injectors LEDs the coil

269
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:14,300
there's the potentiometer for the water

270
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:20,449
temperature you've got the throttle body

271
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:22,370
and the pedal which

272
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:24,170
but you do work so if you push down on

273
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:26,750
the pedal you throat what are you will

274
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:30,550
open depending on the speed arranging

275
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:34,160
how is how far lateral what are you open

276
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:36,890
there are you can see there is the o2

277
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:40,069
simulator you all you can see in that is

278
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:43,430
a flashing LED a very low rate but it

279
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:46,100
seems to fool the ECU itself into

280
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:48,560
thinking the o2 simulator is working by

281
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,960
all the o2 sensor is working there it

282
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,439
still does throw an error message up on

283
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:57,140
the dashboard or the heating heater

284
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:00,170
circuit but to fix that I need to put in

285
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:01,520
some very large resistors to make it

286
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:03,650
think that the actual heaters are

287
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,600
actually there but they will waste a lot

288
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:07,850
of electricity and get very hot very

289
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,910
quickly because they're normally turned

290
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:12,650
on all the time as you can see along the

291
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:15,910
bottom there you've got the steering

292
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:18,650
rack the in fuse box body control module

293
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:22,579
lighting board here on the left hand

294
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:25,610
side which allows you to see what the

295
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:28,640
lights are doing on the right hand side

296
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:31,100
you have the main power boy experience

297
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,920
which is instrument cluster other

298
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:36,050
switches accessories and your ignition

299
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,530
key you do actually have to turn the

300
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:41,390
ignition key to get the thing to turn on

301
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:43,130
you then have to tweak the revs to

302
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:46,120
actually get up above a certain value

303
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:49,580
otherwise it turns itself off again on

304
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:52,760
the screen you can also see and bottom

305
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:55,400
there by where my mouse is there is the

306
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,200
main ovg 2 port on the right hand side

307
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,660
there are two other obd2 connectors

308
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:04,010
which allows you access to normally

309
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:06,680
hidden low speed can buses the last

310
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:10,130
challenge i have between now and these

311
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:12,979
slides leads this friday is to actually

312
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:14,510
get the ABS ECU thinking the wheel

313
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,150
sensors are there because that is the

314
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:18,950
last part of the puzzle and if I can do

315
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:21,230
that I can actually have the whole car

316
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:23,330
in the box thinking they're always

317
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:25,910
moving out what and the engine is

318
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:29,260
running and then you could then hack it

319
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:29,260
in a real-life situation

320
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:37,310
so it basically built for other people

321
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,080
other people to play with I haven't

322
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:41,959
really sat down much and played with

323
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:44,930
myself often causing some of the dials

324
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:48,110
if you look very closely it's got 1.2

325
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:50,329
million miles I supposed the odometer

326
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:54,590
and sent it a bit too far

327
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:56,330
oops but but probably better if someone

328
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:58,790
does it on this vehicle then on their

329
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,170
own daily driver especially there's at

330
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,560
least car on they take it back and go

331
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,719
oops

332
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:08,119
you've done lots of knowledge I'm going

333
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:11,780
to charge you that's me done any

334
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:15,910
comments and questions please put them

335
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:19,069
on Twitter or on the online forum post

336
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:22,219
Twitter use of hashtag it takes a crowd

337
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:24,610
my contact details are on there and if

338
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:27,650
any of you are coming to b-side leads

339
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:30,520
come and say hi coming over play see if

340
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:34,610
you can break it I'm sure someone will

341
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:37,490
cuz I guarantee we break cars at the bug

342
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:56,570
- oops

343
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:58,820
garage that I've just seen a question

344
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:02,240
here on YouTube what was the overall

345
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:05,720
cost of the project the idea in a box

346
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,520
probably cost me about a 500 pound which

347
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,790
is probably about six seven hundred

348
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,770
dollars and the entire car in a box has

349
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:15,349
probably cost me about two thousand

350
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:21,439
pound hopefully my missus isn't watching

351
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:23,990
this but car components aren't cheap the

352
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:27,010
actual box itself probably cost me

353
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:29,540
almost two hundred pound to build itself

354
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:33,140
but it is designed to fit in the boot of

355
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:37,159
my car and be portable currently I only

356
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:39,740
have its booked for b-side leads us

357
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,840
Friday I have had discussions in taking

358
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:44,480
it to null quantum goer

359
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:48,740
however logistics of that would make it

360
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:51,890
almost impossible but hopefully I may

361
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:53,740
take it to Def Con this year if we can

362
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:58,540
get someone to actually ship it for me

363
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:58,540
but any other questions

364
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:11,230
say is think YouTube a crowd for the bug

365
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:15,750
- event and for putting on this event

366
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:15,750
today great fun

367
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:31,340
you very much any other questions that

368
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:34,940
was probably a bit quick but um this

369
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:40,699
talk is actually aimed for this Friday

370
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:43,730
as well the B side leads and basically I

371
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:46,100
once in talked me as sort of quick as

372
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:48,440
possible so that the the actual people

373
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:51,909
got more time on the actual box itself

374
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:53,600
and thanks Chris for your comment and

375
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:55,040
awesome talk as well

376
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,260
I completely understand you there

377
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:00,220
because I've worked in the NHS and I

378
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,220
know what their problems are

379
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:34,210
getting started in car hacking is shall

380
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:36,400
we say not that easy problem is you can

381
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:40,870
the car hacker's handbook is a very good

382
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:43,059
read have a read have a play be very

383
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:47,139
careful with your own vehicle as I said

384
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:49,990
I've previously I've previously bricks

385
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,669
my jag and it lost the gearbox and it

386
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:55,480
took me three attempts to get it back

387
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:57,280
and then took three weeks to basically

388
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,840
learn how to change gear again because

389
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,760
it's got one I'm intelligent gearboxes

390
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,649
that actually learn your driving style

391
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:07,379
and change gear as you would need it

392
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:12,789
change gear I will be at B side leads

393
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:14,590
telling small tan bus adapters at

394
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:16,840
nominal cost that will allow you basic

395
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:19,510
entry into sniffing can later

396
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,520
it doesn't actually give you any access

397
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,950
to sing it back in that you can have a

398
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,440
play you can plug in you can see what

399
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:29,080
messages are coming through do something

400
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,690
like lock the car see which message come

401
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:36,039
through unlock the car then play it back

402
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:38,679
see what happens if you normally if you

403
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:40,419
do break your car disconnect the battery

404
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:46,900
for a considerable amount of time and

405
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:49,990
plug it back in it will normally fix

406
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:52,539
itself there are occasions where you

407
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:54,700
will have to enter you get someone

408
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:57,039
involved help you fix it but hopefully

409
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:59,350
it's not that bad

410
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,879
if there's a car hacker out that says

411
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,980
them says that they've never Britain

412
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,679
around car they're lying because

413
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:09,549
everyone does it you will do it once and

414
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:11,950
you'll think oh my god what I'd done but

415
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:13,840
once you actually fixed it again and got

416
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:15,610
everything working it's great and you

417
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:23,289
will learn something hopefully you don't

418
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:25,990
repeat it so yes yeah the one good

419
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:27,970
resource is contact handbook another

420
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:30,970
good resource is the car hacking village

421
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:33,490
at DEFCON and other events

422
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:35,850
looks like I'm now running

423
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:41,820
car hackers Billy car hacking village UK

424
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:41,820
possibly even Europe mmm maybe going to

425
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:49,240
hack in the box absurd am later in the

426
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:52,659
year with the American caucus hot car

427
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:54,669
hack village team I would like to say

428
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:58,890
thank you to them for their support with

429
00:21:54,669 --> 00:21:58,890
the work is going in for

430
00:22:01,749 --> 00:22:08,389
Chris don't play with air bags they are

431
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:13,700
class one explosives not a good thing to

432
00:22:08,389 --> 00:22:15,889
do I like your style but that's why I

433
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,809
left out the ABA and the airbag ACU

434
00:22:15,889 --> 00:22:19,729
because I didn't want someone setting

435
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:27,049
off a class one explosive in the trace

436
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:28,850
and yeah hacking Tesla's is great if

437
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:36,279
you've got the 90 grand to actually buy

438
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:38,600
the car in its first place so yeah I

439
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:43,249
would like to but no one would actually

440
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:44,959
lend me one KC have you managed to play

441
00:22:43,249 --> 00:22:47,259
with your own little worm canvas it up

442
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,259
here

443
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,780
you

444
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:57,710
lady and this is Sam sorry I can't hear

445
00:22:55,909 --> 00:23:00,679

446
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:03,799
but yeah thank you so much for for

447
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:06,710
helping us out today and I feel free to

448
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:09,080
pass on to the next person whenever

449
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,509
you're ready but thanks man

450
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,918
yep there's just a couple more questions

451
00:23:10,509 --> 00:23:15,559
no I haven't found any bugs in the kit

452
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:16,970
I've set up predominantly because I

453
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:18,379
haven't actually been looking for him

454
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:20,870
I've actually been trying to get the

455
00:23:18,379 --> 00:23:24,678
thing to actually think it's a car and

456
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:27,229
running having to play with scopes and

457
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:28,789
things is a pain in the bum I'm an

458
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,990
electrical engineer but it's been 20

459
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:31,789
years since I've done any of that sort

460
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:34,580
of stuff

461
00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:36,129
Chris your question regarding dieter V

462
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:39,470
and V 2x

463
00:23:36,129 --> 00:23:40,908
don't go there I know how some of the

464
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:43,610
young American traffic light systems

465
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:46,129
work they use no authentication they use

466
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:47,990
no encryption and if you dust them hard

467
00:23:46,129 --> 00:23:51,259
enough you can make the traffic lights

468
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:53,470
change and you can basically have fun if

469
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:56,659
you really want fun have a look at ways

470
00:23:53,470 --> 00:24:00,980
is an API if you want to make your

471
00:23:56,659 --> 00:24:03,379
journey home really easy spoof Yoram GPS

472
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:05,029
location on the API tell him there's a

473
00:24:03,379 --> 00:24:06,949
massive car pileup on your normal route

474
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:08,919
home anyone else using the app will

475
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:10,999
think oh no there's a massive car pileup

476
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:16,789
you can then go oops

477
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:20,929
roads empty jobs are good any more

478
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:24,399
questions I'd like to hand over early to

479
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:24,399
the next one just so we can catch up
