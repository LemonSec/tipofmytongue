1
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:39,600
so how many of you are familiar with the

2
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:44,158
accessories okay so if you have ended my

3
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:47,149
coffee piece years that we feel so we

4
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:57,570
have ransomware as a service movement

5
00:01:47,149 --> 00:02:03,780
usually description technology when

6
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:05,969
people and unfortunately for them it a

7
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,270
great man somewhere but then they know

8
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:13,310
that they will be spread so we can give

9
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,310
this way you have a lever

10
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,470

11

[Music]

12
00:03:26,310 --> 00:04:14,170
so and then that happens that's when you

13
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:21,159
see so spray and brain crisis predict as

14
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:24,580
many as you can and most an agency when

15
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:27,570
you get infected so how many of you see

16
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,570
or stay

17
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,799
[Music]

18
00:05:31,919 --> 00:06:04,270
so if you follow the maximum and browser

19
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:18,280
system and this is what so six days will

20
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:21,280
be ten days two days and you would know

21
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:25,539
this year there's well chat service so

22
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:29,679
if you have questions to ask them how do

23
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:32,190
I get people's because there's so many

24
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,190
things

25
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:45,710
some of that meeting is how to get it

26
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:49,040
like that's why most of the recipes we

27
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:52,070
would see ransomware there's a small

28
00:06:49,040 --> 00:07:01,610
tutorial here cockpit points this is

29
00:06:52,070 --> 00:07:02,440
where you tell if I'm going to be here

30
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,540
very good

31
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:11,000
sentiment is asthma questions there's

32
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:12,560
also about 1945 I shall not stand up if

33
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,110
you want to make sure that they're

34
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:20,389
possibly the group you can set them by

35
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:32,169
class a little bit particular spots this

36
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:36,229
is a very thousand dollars per machine

37
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:43,419
of course of course you thought because

38
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:45,380
it was really behind but they really do

39
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:48,680
so for this one

40
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:54,169
this is a bit in see right now is a

41
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:57,349
great actor what you see this is a

42
00:07:54,169 --> 00:08:01,190
decibel so they have access to this and

43
00:07:57,349 --> 00:08:06,349
they see how many infections there are

44
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:08,780
for example this day one is going to be

45
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:11,060
inventions the point one they are

46
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:14,659
coordinate infections and this is during

47
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:17,270
the early days after they spread

48
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:20,690
ransomware this would pollute to

49
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:25,729
hundreds with hundreds of thousands of

50
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:30,969
militants so imagine you're giving this

51
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:34,779
money or or why don't you you have a

52
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:34,779
thousand infections

53
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:54,800
and imagine if Polident comes up with

54
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:59,990
three flats for decryption so he takes a

55
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:07,699
lot of time that's why I am the

56
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:12,610
underground they also have apps for nice

57
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:12,609
for one big big support earn dollars

58
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:22,339
must be a native English speaker so they

59
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:25,910
try to hire people from around the world

60
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:36,350
back subjects but of course they get at

61
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:38,750
subjects still stays on so most of the

62
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:41,959
work is weaved under the penalties right

63
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:44,540
so we're getting three thousand for

64
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:49,388
infection and then it takes a lot of

65
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:49,389
time to manage all of those customers

66
00:09:49,569 --> 00:10:00,740
handing the chats so what they do is

67
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:03,910
they electronically so imagine we have

68
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:17,209
our with massive infections paying

69
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:21,069
$3,000 and deductions let's imagine you

70
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:24,609
have one infection a major corporation

71
00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:27,130
city government and they should stay

72
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:31,930
that's been crippled by the ransomware

73
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:31,930
we finish we ask for millions of dollars

74
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:44,269
so you manage one bit in they say well

75
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:46,630
concentrate and this is a view so we

76
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:57,220
have is one of our most popular Maximus

77
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:57,220
particles so

78
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,709
[Music]

79
00:11:11,790 --> 00:12:35,709
so how much but for a targeted

80
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:44,379
ransomware it's more about that

81
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:51,008
one-on-one communication also one thing

82
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:52,720
this is also true for but in a microwave

83
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:55,389
encrypting it works for before a

84
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:59,559
temperature files it has to kill all of

85
00:12:55,389 --> 00:13:04,300
the processes so that when we encrypt it

86
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:07,899
therefore be in your hand so as you can

87
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:11,750
see here most of these will be found

88
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:14,060
with the ransom Unicode which is there

89
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,890
something you said base especially if

90
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,050
you met somewhere if you see something

91
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:21,430
that needs indicators or something like

92
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:23,510
this if you see boat or a bad box that

93
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:29,540
without being searched for different

94
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:32,750
status participate presently and most of

95
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:36,610
the other target address where they're

96
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:40,750
designed not only to encrypt your

97
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:43,760
service so you should be passed this

98
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:55,070
process but stopping different services

99
00:13:43,760 --> 00:14:19,790
for concern box so sure about disrupting

100
00:13:55,070 --> 00:14:22,460
existing so backups is one way so with

101
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:28,180
those two targets these are the language

102
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:31,430
this is what we can see organizations

103
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:42,790
with business models so we've got a

104
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:50,000
deadline thanks for watching and also

105
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:52,760
organizations that provide services or

106
00:14:50,000 --> 00:15:04,450
infrastructure so anything that's

107
00:14:52,760 --> 00:15:08,680
sensitive targets also you can see here

108
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:08,680
most of the part of the brands where

109
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:18,620
they do some research for example one is

110
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:21,050
these findings or information company

111
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:25,570
might have a statement out there that

112
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:25,569
says you just introduce lead technology

113
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,959
[Music]

114
00:16:40,190 --> 00:17:29,929
so and so we have invention vectors span

115
00:17:36,450 --> 00:19:39,859
so once or another so we have to have

116
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:39,859
that certain ability after an infection

117
00:19:49,940 --> 00:21:24,000
so there's no rules regarding its main

118
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:27,420
function existed Richard might have

119
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:35,220
other functions a second conviction they

120
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:38,700
got a gearbox so there's so many Peaks

121
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:42,230
as might happen and one thing that you

122
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,230
should have decided somebody

123
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:56,050
and what people to see is that

124
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:59,600
remarkable attacks this is communication

125
00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:04,040
email you should use an ongoing

126
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:06,159
communication and judgments so what is a

127
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:09,590
great afternoon so I can believe about

128
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:19,420
that questions get stopped they'll give

129
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:22,389
you suggestions they say make sure so

130
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:25,700
since they know they're getting paid

131
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:28,550
because the questions that we respond in

132
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:46,070
a very relative dependence a relatively

133
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:53,110
fast some actively respond and these are

134
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:53,110
the known indications for so we hear

135
00:22:54,760 --> 00:23:17,150
organisation but money here's and most

136
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:21,139
of us some of it is about being stored

137
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:27,890
back how fresh survey let's see how

138
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:34,309
badly but invitation would be days that

139
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:36,980
means one week some companies they would

140
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:43,428
rather pay that this one about in

141
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:53,000
operation because that one we million

142
00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:57,169
dollars so those company what methods

143
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,080
see them innocent is a decision that's

144
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:04,639
why I'm very nice of you

145
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:09,189
this is decision and that's it for me

146
00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:09,189
the warszawa any questions

147
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:33,799
the violent reactions then we have

148
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:44,869
questions comments well my team 90% of

149
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:48,759
oh but uh seriously yes if you're if

150
00:24:44,869 --> 00:24:48,759
you're pretty much my relaxes where and

151
00:24:52,179 --> 00:25:05,960
and don't hesitate and like to thank you

152
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:12,820
again for giving me the opportunity to

153
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:15,920
