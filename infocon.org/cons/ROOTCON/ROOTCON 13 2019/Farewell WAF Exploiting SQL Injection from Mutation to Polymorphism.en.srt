[Music]

2
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,869
[Music]

3
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,249
[Music]

4
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:37,669
[Music]

5
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:46,699
so I have straight eight into three

6
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,700
parts in the first part

7
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:53,239
[Music]

8
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,360
[Music]

9
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,430
[Music]

10
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,529
[Music]

11
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:18,220
assuming they notice it is subject to

12
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:18,220
the zoo nutrition right so easy to

13
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,120
possible injection

14
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:30,860
so in particular this future so here is

15
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,760
my first illusion that we choose the

16
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,830
glass

17
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,829
[Music]

18
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,580
so this

19
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,649
[Music]

20
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:31,250
[Music]

21
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,839
[Music]

22
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,979
[Music]

23
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,800
[Music]

24
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,190
[Music]

25
00:06:10,270 --> 00:07:37,960
because there is

26
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:59,669
[Music]

27
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,590
[Music]

28
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:33,630
[Music]

29
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:37,670
we can't afford these techniques to zip

30
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:43,689
through the first ones is changing

31
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:43,689
[Music]

32
00:10:05,720 --> 00:11:31,040
the allocation means

33
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,019
[Music]

34
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:50,820
as in structure in fact some additional

35
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:53,970
attacks will be that simple

36
00:11:50,820 --> 00:12:00,470
eight and while we have an industry the

37
00:11:53,970 --> 00:12:00,470
spirit is the implication of this time

38
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:08,099
so now that we have almost dated the

39
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:11,670
concept of mutation that's kind of got

40
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:19,410
past the first time we can cook so do

41
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:23,459
you have the way to do so--here is for

42
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:27,510
working exploit as you can see there is

43
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:29,850
a zero before keyword and a zero you

44
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:32,640
spent how an American actor so he

45
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:39,900
doesn't complex the theater and he will

46
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:45,270
be executed the watch this actually 16 0

47
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:48,500
is an approximation in scientific

48
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:52,410
notation we decided to simply

49
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:55,020
disappointing so in this one even

50
00:12:52,410 --> 00:13:03,390
understand where it should stop awesome

51
00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:05,100
even the amusements and his faces they

52
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:09,510
said that we can finally come to the

53
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:23,870
part of the management activities in

54
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:23,870
medicine so this University

55
00:13:25,619 --> 00:13:44,850
- then insulin injection discrepancy

56
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:47,618
between mutation and we are actually

57
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:51,730
informatica structures which is very

58
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:56,410
informative and one way that makes it

59
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:58,929
unique is that the courage transform

60
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:03,969
keyboard and accurate information is

61
00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:07,480
perfect ten percent Olympics so here is

62
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:11,949
an example so we have to represent off

63
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:24,809
the drug lots of patients however after

64
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:24,809
a good foundation different locations so

65
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:44,709
it means that we can change for

66
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:49,420
regionals and ethics and not covetous so

67
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:51,508
let's compare this to concept so

68
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:56,219
initiation trying to do with place

69
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:59,829
single offering other acceptable watch

70
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:02,079
but only Morrison trying to replace the

71
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:07,929
state because the Birdman spot the whole

72
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:11,138
statement with additional mutation

73
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:14,769
volunteers about would not mistaken a

74
00:15:11,139 --> 00:15:17,709
new site whereas for the autism cares

75
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:23,829
the whole statement including the

76
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:26,309
president in the process besides there

77
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:26,309

so I

00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,909
[Music]

97
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:35,150

[Music]

99
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:44,740
the leases of one student is cremated

100
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:48,610
several times and the desert code is as

101
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:54,419
10% Blanca which is obviously a mystic

102
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:58,479
commodity lagrimas harder after

103
00:21:54,419 --> 00:22:02,009
replacing the was intimately unless

104
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:05,889
that's the shorter ago a change to

105
00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:09,070
members monopoly which is an all listed

106
00:22:05,889 --> 00:22:14,949
in the big release so we successfully

107
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:18,820
pass the inspection and after docking

108
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:22,480
into the physical we thought we found

109
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:25,178
out that a magnet X is that as an

110
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:30,100
operator while on the handsome face of

111
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:40,720
the magician so then that is why there

112
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:51,260
is one view and it turns out to be for

113
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:52,860
my support because my sexiness there

114
00:22:51,260 --> 00:23:04,950
[Music]

115
00:22:52,860 --> 00:23:07,949
with this one and strapped to a

116
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,950
stretcher

117
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:20,700
it's own best item I pass exist I work

118
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:24,680
so hard environment is almost identical

119
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:30,260
to be difficult we just changed it

120
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:30,260
wah-wah snow ask to American society

121
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:35,580
however before Bellino there are

122
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,050
something we need to know about American

123
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:41,990
society

124
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:52,800
so it's a naturally suspicious behaviour

125
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:56,610
because the community the single was

126
00:23:52,800 --> 00:24:01,610
simple research and research work by old

127
00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:08,689
cinema simulations besides many

128
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:08,689
participation is to directly somehow

129
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:14,640
third order a name to be chanted

130
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:19,110
blindest for each application that we

131
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:22,580
call in order to do in order to increase

132
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:25,639
that both acetates and make it varies

133
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:28,379
this is not really easy for developers

134
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:36,240
because especially for applications

135
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:39,950
watch changeable due to the fact that in

136
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:42,930
time once all application stock exchange

137
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:51,330
but you still have to do that because

138
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:53,460
you don't want to get sick so in fact

139
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:57,870
there are actually some fiction while

140
00:24:53,460 --> 00:25:04,410
his parents were common web applications

141
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:06,659
such as workers go insane thanks for the

142
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:10,550
recording to you may exist and speaking

143
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:13,070
the place is i has officially support

144
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:16,070
[Music]

145
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:16,070
so

146
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:21,429
[Music]

147
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,749
[Music]

148
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:33,639
[Music]

149
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,339
[Music]

150
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:36,569
[Music]

151
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,829
[Music]

152
00:27:27,860 --> 00:28:30,049
so which are to our system and there are

153
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:30,049
going to conferences like the quotient

154
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:39,270
the statements so the first one is three

155
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:42,240
black completions in this war we

156
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:45,150
actually use for the northern spots to

157
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:49,470
disassembly to expand the word process

158
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:52,710
solutions so after the transformations

159
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:57,570
we can get back the peculiar comparison

160
00:28:52,710 --> 00:29:05,970
in the conditions why us the the

161
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:09,270
semantics and the second rule due to the

162
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:13,830
same part in the work process we can use

163
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:19,139
an operator just empty for different for

164
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:21,889
different conditions into this role

165
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,890
which in

166
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:38,369
[Music]

167
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:53,229
[Music]

168
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,319
[Music]

169
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:56,139
[Music]

170
00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:34,549
so that is important we already don't

171
00:31:26,099 --> 00:31:34,549
have the invariance port so happy

172
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:44,190
[Music]

173
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:09,909

00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,439

[Music]

176
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:14,460
- so what instantly devastating no it's

177
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:14,460
select two in front to the people and

178
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:24,700
maybe also need to care about the

179
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:27,190
awkward part selection phase so people

180
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:31,539
these selection things have originally

181
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:36,899
selected from Anton table which reverses

182
00:33:31,539 --> 00:33:36,899
to infinity the after changing

183
00:33:48,090 --> 00:34:29,080
so we can also like send a fragment of

184
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:36,359
the statement to the system but then

185
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:36,359
grab that piece the job system - exactly

186
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:51,520
so we can use this system so now that we

187
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:55,330
know how the system works so here is in

188
00:34:51,520 --> 00:35:00,700
variation within Superman but besides

189
00:34:55,330 --> 00:35:04,598
that we mentioned we also we are the

190
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:07,839
treatment passes this one into lots of

191
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:10,089
insurance to quantify a secret which is

192
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:14,980
called holding physical health or

193
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:21,580
sickness is addressed as the protection

194
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:24,450
of and this one is about both techniques

195
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,450
first

196
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,630

languages in ceremonies conceptually

202
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:25,430
protections we must import a

203
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:27,860
presentation title set so it is possible

204
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:31,480
for us to balance their protection by

205
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:31,480
his invitation
