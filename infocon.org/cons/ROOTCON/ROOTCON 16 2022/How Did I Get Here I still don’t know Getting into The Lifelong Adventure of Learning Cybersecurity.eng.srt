how's everybody doing

7
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,600
all right in the beginning y'all were

8
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,160
quiet now we're starting to pick up a

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,680
little bit which is nice

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,160
all right so as the introduction said my

11
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,719
name is Jester James and I'm here to

12
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,340
talk about the lifelong adventure of

13
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,219
learning cyber security and dfir who

14
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,140
here knows what dfir means so I don't

15
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,360
have to say all right we got a few hands

16
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,579
but so dfir stands for digital forensics

17
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,559
and incident response so in cyber

18
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,000
security a lot of folks they like to

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,580
talk about hacking and red teaming the

20
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,979
blue teaming side the defensive side is

21
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,780
digital forensics and instant response

22
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,720
or D for for short and I'm really here

23
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,000

Champlain College with a degree in

28
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,200
computer networking cyber security with

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,479
a minor in digital forensics in 2020 so

30
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,520
during the whole covid coronavirus

31
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,040
pandemic and all that jazz so got to

32
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,560

presentation today one of our great

39
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,159
Partners is crowdstrike so really got to

40
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,140
kind of Leverage my experience out of

41
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,119
this classroom and then really apply it

42
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,640
in an industry-specific experience doing

43
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,320
exactly kind of what Aaron was talking

44
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,479
about there kind of looking at those

45
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,340
Chinese cybers threats Chinese cyber

46
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,900
Espionage and doing a little with threat

47
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,480
intelligence as well and I'm going to be

48
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,879
talking about how you can go and develop

49
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,340
your own adventure of learning cyber

50
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,620
security digital forensics and any Niche

51
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,900
you want in cyber security

52
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,120
so you can find me at Jester James on

53
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,140
Twitter and Instagram or jamescanth.com

54
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,200
and let's get started

55
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,239
so disclaimer obviously is a

56
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,280
presentation about how to there's more

57
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,720
than one way to do it so I'm going to

58
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,920
give you all a little bit of tips and

59
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,540
tricks a little bit of curriculum I'm

60
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,580
not going to lie definitely in line with

61
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,680
my website and YouTube channel and stuff

62
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,440
along those lines that being said the

63
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,660
presentation is titled the lifelong

64
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,180
journey of learning cyber security so a

65
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,980
lot of folks you know they they join

66
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,420
cyber security maybe they go a couple

67
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,220
years and then they leave you don't

68
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,360
really see a lot of seasoned

69
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,739
Professionals in cyber security who have

70
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,140
been around for maybe 10 or 20 years and

71
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,000
that's really because mental health has

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,099
always been a thing imposter syndrome so

73
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:10,260
I always like to to add that mental

74
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,940
health is important so take care of

75
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,980
yourself burnout is real we're at a

76
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,140
security conference so technically we

77
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,760
can still kind of say we're working

78
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,159
outside of the shots here and there but

79
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,620
burnout is real imposter syndrome is

80
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,140
real so disclaimer and Shout Out take

81
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,720
care of yourselves

82
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,000
so I'm going to start off the bat here

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,640
uh going on the different phases so

84
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,440
lifelong journey right we have the

85
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,940
beginner intermediate and advanced

86
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,819
phases so with a show of hands I'm not

87
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,560
going to call anybody out or ask anybody

88
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,480
to to kind of reply but where do you all

89
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,819
kind of think you are just uh sitting in

90
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,620
your chairs here and and watching the

91
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,480
presentation so far you feel like you're

92
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,760
over in the Charmander area you're

93
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,440
you're more of the ward turtle or you're

94
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,120
feeling you're a little Advanced you

95
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,879
could be Blastoise there

96
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,079
anybody for beginner

97
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:03,599
all right we got some hands intermediate

98
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,680
nobody's raising your hands come on

99
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,840
all right so I'm going to say I'll be

100
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,700
the astronaut in the presentation I'll

101
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,860
follow myself in between phase two and

102
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,480
phase three I want to consider myself

103
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,000
Advanced note that it's in quotes as

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,858
well definitely I feel like I'm a little

105
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,839
bit more on the intermediate level not

106
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,639
towards a beginner given the fact that I

107
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,540
have gone and gotten a degree in cyber

108
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,020
so again pause I want to really open the

109
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,780
crowd up wake us up a little bit uh some

110
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,220
things I want you all to think about as

111
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,479
I'm going to be talking in our

112
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,639
presentation is what are your goals

113
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,500
where do you see yourself in one two or

114
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,960
three years as any great life coach

115
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,940
would say if you're feeling down at life

116
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,440
or you're not really sure where you're

117
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,940
going or just floating through life

118
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,220
really you want to have a good plan it's

119
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,440
laid out so if you're going to college

120
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,240
right they say they have your curriculum

121
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,639
or if you go to your job they have your

122
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,880
your documentation to read and uh go to

123
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,520
for a plan a game plan to go and execute

124
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,080
so if you have a position you're aiming

125
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,120
to be in anybody looking to be csos out

126
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,520
in the audience future cisos Chief

127
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,100
information security officers all right

128
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,620
there we go yeah I don't like csos

129
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,840
because they get a little management E I

130
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,280
like to stay Technical and have a little

131
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,419
bit fun

132
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,759
so that being said the lifelong

133
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,220
adventure and adding the setting goals

134
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,120
right you want to make sure you're

135
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,160
setting smart goals right so be specific

136
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,680
measurable attainable realistic and time

137
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,780
managed so if you're going from

138
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,699
absolutely no technical experience no

139
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,820
experience in cyber security at all then

140
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,199
you're going to want to make sure you're

141
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,060
setting your goals up and you're making

142
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,800
sure they're they're smart goals and at

143
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,139
the same time you're human be kind with

144
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:45,180
yourself be kind to others because

145
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,919
burnout is real imposter syndrome is

146
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,960
real

147
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,880
so let's get straight to it I'm going to

148
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,919
go on talking about phase one starting

149
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,419
out beginner what are some of those

150
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:55,919
things that you're going to want to get

151
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,539
into first if you don't know anything

152
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:00,539
about cyber security and those would be

153
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:04,139
the fundamentals so is any new position

154
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:06,600
you get you go into college your first

155
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,539
year anything that you start that's new

156
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:11,820
you're nervous you're drinking from a

157
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,460
fire hose a bunch of new information but

158
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,320
in cyber security and Computing and

159
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,320
Technology the key component is to

160
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,300
master the fundamentals because the

161
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,520
fundamentals don't change so in my

162
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,400
experience so far in the industry and

163
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,160
also in watching various presentations

164
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,780
and speakers and talking with speakers

165
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,199
is that all of these Concepts that are

166
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,020
more kind of advanced or explained all

167
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,819
are built on those found on those

168
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,520
fundamentals on those foundations so if

169
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,039
you master the fundamentals then you're

170
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:45,720
setting yourself up for success in the

171
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,960
long term that way you can go and really

172
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,180
Skyrocket your career forward into

173
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,580
really anything and cyber security is

174
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,880
your your oyster as they say so all the

175
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,500
information will come at you but embrace

176
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,240
the fire hose it's part of the fun of it

177
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,460
and

178
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,160
what are those fundamentals that'll be

179
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,780
computer networking Network and system

180
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,819
administration and my personal plug

181
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,080
would be setting up your own lab

182
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,600
environment so anybody here know a

183
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,919
little bit about like networking or

184
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,300
network Administration any network

185
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,280
administrators out there as opposed to

186
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,620
pen testers or incident response

187
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,720
analysts I see some folks so those are

188
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,919
the folks that are keeping your network

189
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:25,380
alive shout out to the root con Network

190
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,020
team and and black team in the back

191
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,180
keeping their internet up keeping our

192
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,460
presentation alive because in computer

193
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,139
networking right your foundations your

194
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:35,699
fundamentals the thing you're going to

195
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,319
cover right in order for you to defend a

196
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,000
computer network you need to know what

197
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,620
is a computer network how to build it

198
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,180
and how to defend it and things along

199
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,979
those lines right so the fundamental

200
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:46,199
topics I'm sure some of you all are

201
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,539
rolling your eyes because it's annoying

202
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,639
topic but subnetting subnetting is one

203
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,560
of the most critical skills that you can

204
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,620
learn in cyber security because

205
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,120
subnetting is a component of how you're

206
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,460
going to get an IP address an IP address

207
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,620
is a classic buzzer and anybody knows

208
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,139
anybody common consumer knows what an IP

209
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:05,699
address and it's the internet address

210
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:08,460
right however subnetting is what is

211
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,039
going to allow you to get your IP from

212
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,900
multiple different computers so you're

213
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,360
going to go talk about routing firewalls

214
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,520
Nat Packet Tracer all these kind of

215
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,379
buzzword things is what you'd be diving

216
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:21,780
into in the beginning and you can open

217
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,300
them up and your fundamental Network

218
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,900
stack your network protocols is TCP and

219
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,520
so when you go and you do something like

220
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,560
you go to the car hacking Village and

221
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,120
you learn about can bus and the can

222
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,159
protocol you'll learn about how that's

223
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,860
overlaid on top of the TCP foundation

224
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,679
and how all of these technologies that

225
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,080
are being produced and created today are

226
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,000
all built on these foundations so

227
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,740
definitely go and you want to make sure

228
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,040
you're mastering your fundamentals a TCP

229
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,880
natting Network and system

230
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,160
administration new technologies have

231
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,839
come out so networking system

232
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,839
administration that's a job in itself so

233
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,160
folks have been creating new

234
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,080
technologies to support that niche as

235
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,080
well so ansible Docker cloud kubernetes

236
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,140
and my personal plug when you're first

237
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,820
starting out is to set up your own lab

238
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,220
environment so I want to make sure that

239
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,440
whether it's cloud or a virtual

240
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,540
environment or maybe you have a server

241
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,459
and you're going to go and set up a

242
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,680
physical lab environment definitely go

243
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,180
I'll be making a little bit of push of

244
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,580
that in the presentation because as

245
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,680
we're presentation in in Aaron's

246
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,060
presentation he's talking about threat

247
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,519
intelligence and defending

248
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,560
you want to have to raise your awareness

249
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,940
so in order for you to raise your

250
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,200
awareness you got to know what's normal

251
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,180
right so set up your own lab environment

252
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,380
you'll be able to kind of visualize

253
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,540
what's normal that way when you see

254
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,120
something that's sus or evil it's easier

255
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,880
for you to identify

256
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,399
that being said the lifelong journey

257
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,320
writes there's new technologies coming

258
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,180
out every day like Docker Cloud

259
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,940
kubernetes so how do you stay up to date

260
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,100
personally these are just my

261
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,800
recommendations I use Feedly Feedly is a

262
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,779
tool that basically collects all of your

263
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:03,779
news it can have 500 000 new sources

264
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:06,120
collects them all in RSS feeds and you

265
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,680
can read them all in one place five

266
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,459
times as fast and also a big push for

267
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:13,500
podcasts I love listening to podcasts in

268
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,300
the morning because it gives you the

269
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,180
Daily News anything that's new and for

270
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,580
my job as an instant response analyst if

271
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,019
there's a new vulnerability or a new

272
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:23,279
exploit out

273
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,580
like say solarwinds or or the active

274
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,080
directory vulnerability that was in the

275
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,240
prior presentation I'll learn I'll hear

276
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,100
about it on that podcast that way when I

277
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,080
go to work I'm already primed to the

278
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,420
teeth with what I'm looking for and I I

279
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,880
have a little bit of a foot head there

280
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,800
that being said new technologies always

281
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,480
come around so you have to embrace them

282
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,700
and to be honest you don't really have a

283
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,480
choice so shout out to recorded future

284
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,519
and and and my my friend Alan here

285
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,140
you'll be hearing from him next but I

286
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,339
wanted to shout out recorded future

287
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:54,839
because they do a really great podcast

288
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:57,480
in the morning called the record and

289
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,880
also the Cyber wire and those are two of

290
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,440
my favorite podcasts that I listen to

291
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,839
every morning

292
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,880
so like I was saying before everything

293
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,620
adds up so you want to start with a

294
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,839
really strong foundation so when you're

295
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,160
going and you're doing something like

296
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,779
what I do which is instant response

297
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:16,079
you're monitoring a network so I get to

298
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,720
use what Aaron's company crowdstrike

299
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,240
they produce a EDR platform which is an

300
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,800
endpoint detection response platform

301
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,079
that essentially you deploy it in your

302
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:27,360
company environment so every single

303
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,019
computer even your iPhones are getting

304
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:32,940
tracked and all that data is going to

305
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,740
the company to the security operations

306
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,640
center

307
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,040
and as an incident response analyst I

308
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,720
get to look at all that Telemetry I get

309
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,820
to see all that data now if I didn't

310
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,100
know anything about networking it would

311
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,920
be like I'm reading the Rosetta Stone a

312
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,320
totally different language IP addresses

313
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,180
protocols that I don't recognize I don't

314
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,120
know and even still on the job there's

315
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,980
things that I don't know you'll never

316
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,079
really know everything and that's part

317
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,760
of the beauty of being alive the

318
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,240
discovery so again really strong push to

319
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,980
start with the foundations because when

320
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,140
you're starting out in cyber security

321
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,519
it's really really easy for you to get

322
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,560
excited and and you're very passionate

323
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,480
the fire is light inside of you and you

324
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,640
love it and you might say oh I want to

325
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,260
be a hacker I want to go I want to do

326
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,260
offensive security go get my oscp shout

327
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,399
out to offensive security I think

328
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,360
they're one of the vendors over there

329
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,899
but you if you can't go and do your

330
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:26,579
found your foundations your fundamentals

331
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,740
then you're not going to do as well when

332
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,480
you get there so you have to be patient

333
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,680
with yourself

334
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,740
I have to be patient with myself and

335
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,540
practice the foundations make sure you

336
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,120
build your foundations up that way when

337
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,519
you want and you are at that level that

338
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,380
intermediate level you've evolved you're

339
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,820
no longer Squirtle your War Turtle

340
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,279
you're not Charmander you're Charmeleon

341
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,680
you can go straight to those Advanced

342
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,440
topics of that you can go and build off

343
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,779
of and then the real fun starts to begin

344
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:57,000
so I've said it enough times and I'll

345
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,139
say it again

346
00:12:58,139 --> 00:12:59,760
start with a strong Foundation because

347
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,079
everything compounds on itself

348
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,100
so as I mentioned before

349
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,380
my push what I do is digital forensics

350
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,760
and instant response so as an incident

351
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,639
responder my job is to look in an EDR

352
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,019
platform and look at all that Network

353
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:15,420
Telemetry from a computer environment so

354
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,880
don't delay start threat hunting today

355
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,220
I make a massive push for all of y'all

356
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,139
to set up an elastic stack on your own

357
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:24,779
computers and that's only that'll take

358
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:27,240
you 20 minutes trust me I got YouTube

359
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,459
videos for it so go to James cave.com

360
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:30,959
you can go and check out my YouTube

361
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,399
channel you can check out my website

362
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,560
I'll spin you up an elastic stack in 20

363
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,839
minutes on your computer on an Ubuntu

364
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,680
222 Os or various os's and if you want

365
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,000
any assistance with that you can feel

366
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,800
free to reach out to me or you can come

367
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,779
up to me after the presentation is done

368
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:47,820
and the component to that is really for

369
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,980
instant response and and really for

370
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,620
threat hunting so Falcon is a really

371
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,920
great tool that I've leveraged quite a

372
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,680
bit that's produced by crowdstrike and

373
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,720
it's a threat hunting tool because it

374
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,279
allows you to see literally everything

375
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,380
in your computer environment that being

376
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,980
said not everything is evil right so how

377
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,200
many of y'all have your iPhones maybe

378
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,480
you've got iMessage data going in there

379
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,459
maybe you have Safari data going in

380
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:15,480
there but how are you going to see

381
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,820
what's different between a regular user

382
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,540
in the company and an attacker you have

383
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,480
to know normal in order to find evil so

384
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,639
starting earlier the earlier the better

385
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,620
which is why I make this push for for

386
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,240
folks that are even in high school I've

387
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,380
gone and I've talked to some high

388
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,779
schoolers as well and they've shown up

389
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:35,519
an elastic sack and they don't know what

390
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,200
they're looking at all they can barely

391
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,000
they're on Tick Tock they can barely sit

392
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,500
in front of the computer for 15 seconds

393
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,860
really so the component here is to

394
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,720
really start threat hunting and set up

395
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,519
on the Isaac stack because it'll help

396
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,320
you know normal you'll be able to know

397
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,940
what those living off the land binaries

398
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,500
are what those living off the land

399
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,120
scripts are that Aaron was mentioning

400
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,459
earlier and once you know those and you

401
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:58,500
familiarize yourself with them it'll be

402
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,000
a lot easier for you to find the

403
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,560
attacker and the needle in the haystack

404
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,199
so don't delay please start through

405
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,480
hunting today

406
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,459
so at this point right we've mastered

407
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:10,560
the foundation the foundations we've

408
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,240
started threat hunting we're at a good

409
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,760
point we're at we're Jester James here

410
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,260
we're up on the stage we're a little bit

411
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,839
in that intermediate now once you have

412
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,579
that Insight right you're threatened

413
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:22,260
your your got threat hunting you've got

414
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,420
your elastic stack spun up now you can

415
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,459
see all that data coming in you didn't

416
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,320
see that data before there's stuff in

417
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,820
there that you didn't even know your

418
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,139
company would be able to see you didn't

419
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,240
even know that this was being tracked on

420
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,160
the operating system level

421
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,500
so you start to get this New Perspective

422
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,839
new eyesight New Vision

423
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,180
you can see into the forever really so

424
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,339
the component to that that I mentioned

425
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:46,800
is because it really comes out into the

426
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,680
fact of of real life as well

427
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,079
the the the buzzword everybody likes to

428
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,120
say in cyber is operational security or

429
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,760
opsec and the component to that is when

430
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,320
you start to get into cyber security and

431
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,120
you learn all these things you get

432
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,779
paranoid you get scared and you know I

433
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:05,399
always like to say it's it's not

434
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,519
paranoid if if it's true in Aaron's case

435
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:11,820
I'm sure China is now on his laptop so

436
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,760
that being said in opsec you'll have

437
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,440
very different things that you start to

438
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,480
think about so for this presentation for

439
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,820
example I noticed I think Aaron you

440
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,339
plugged in using USBC right I plugged in

441
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:26,880
using HDMI however if I was a little if

442
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,160
I was in China maybe I would use like a

443
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,360
HDMI to USBC adapter or I would be using

444
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,699
if I'm plugging in my iPhone I would be

445
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:38,279
using a USB blocker so essentially what

446
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:41,279
this USB blocker device does is it

447
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:46,740
blocks the line of copper on the usb-8

448
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,500
chip side from reading and writing data

449
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,959
essentially so it'll turn your your

450
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:54,600
iPhone charger wire your cable that you

451
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,579
can connect to the computer into a dumb

452
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:59,220
just simple charging wire and small

453
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,079
moves like that that'll help you out in

454
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:03,120
the long term because next thing you

455
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,919
know China might be asking Aaron to

456
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:07,319
present and Aaron I'll give this to you

457
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,240
so you can go to China and not have to

458
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,020
worry about some things

459
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:14,760
so that being said now you've got the

460
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,160
site right you can see going from

461
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,020
Padawan to Jedi Knight how are you going

462
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,240
to take that and run with it and keep

463
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,619
running because as I was mentioning

464
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:24,599
earlier new technology keeps evolving

465
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,520
which means you're going to have to keep

466
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,340
on staying up to date you have to learn

467
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,799
new things new technologies and all of

468
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:34,020
these are in an effort to make your job

469
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,240
better your daily life better

470
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,640
so at this point once you have your

471
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,260
foundations mastered in cyber security

472
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,320
you can really go any really any route

473
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,539
you have won so the industry is your

474
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,340
oyster as I've said so if you want to do

475
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,679
red teaming so hacking anybody know

476
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,539
about like X-Force red I think when I

477
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,760
speak of IBM's X-Force a lot of folks

478
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,860
usually they know about X-Force red more

479
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,360
because they're known as the red teamers

480
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,340
the hackers the attackers they get all

481
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,380
the good press I want X-Force incident

482
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,179
response up here the blue teamers The

483
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:04,559
Defenders they should be getting some

484
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,480
good press too but if you want to get

485
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,000
into pen testing hack the box is a free

486
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,820
resource the owasp top 10 so OAS who

487
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,700
here knows about oasp raise your hands

488
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,039
some of some of y'all all right cool so

489
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,840
oh I suppose you open web application

490
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,360
security project and they focus on web

491
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,000
applications and web security so really

492
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,100
you can go and become an attacker

493
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,559
practice exploit development and and

494
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,419
your red teaming skills using hack the

495
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:32,760
boss and learning about OAS 10 about and

496
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,580
among other things now to do what I do

497
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,980
and doing instant response or security

498
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,380
operations you wouldn't want to learn

499
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,380
more about seams EDR MDR and really log

500
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,640
analysis

501
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,220
so seams are a security incident and

502
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,960
event management systems and endpoint

503
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,400
detection and response systems really

504
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,020
those are just the tools that you have

505
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,480
to deploy in order to see everything so

506
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,840
security operations really log analysis

507
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,280
you're looking at the screen all day but

508
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,620
you're basically a digital detective you

509
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,900
are a digital Sherlock Holmes as I like

510
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,940
to call myself

511
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,340
next level up maybe you want to combine

512
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,380
the two which is another great thing so

513
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,059
another great thing that I've recently

514
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,620
noticed in the industry is that we're

515
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,299
not only doing red teaming and blue

516
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:17,520
teaming anymore it's evolved to really

517
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,100
be purple teaming because as Aaron was

518
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,380
mentioning in his presentation before

519
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,600
ran somewhere in the Cyber attackers

520
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,400
it's not like the movies anymore they're

521
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,679
not one-offs and we don't have folks who

522
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:30,539
are who are just going and attacking

523
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:32,760
kind of one-off late they've developed

524
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,679
and they've created themselves to the

525
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:36,480
point in which they're a business model

526
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,400
I've been working a lot of them at a

527
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,080
time with my with my brother Josh he's

528
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,340
been teaching me a lot about business

529
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,559
business management and I've really

530
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:44,640
learned a lot about these business

531
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,400
models and in my job as an incident

532
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,679
response analyst I can see clear as day

533
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,720
evidence just like the presentation

534
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,419
prior referencing that these apts these

535
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:56,400
Advanced groups like China Russia

536
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,380
they're all forming and they're

537
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,700
attacking and they're doing their

538
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,860
operations like a business so they have

539
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,660
a business model behind it

540
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,900
that might not be as bad as it sounds

541
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,020
but when you're down in the trenchers

542
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,539
it's just like a service hacking as a

543
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:15,240
service ransomware as a service it's

544
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,059
pretty problematic but to be honest I

545
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:19,620
feel like a lot of the Professionals in

546
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,419
the industry say that have been around

547
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:23,520
they were expecting this

548
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,220
that being said just like the the push

549
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,260
and the last message from from my friend

550
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,059
Aaron he's telling you about raising

551
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:31,620
that awareness you want to get into

552
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,120
threat intelligence you want to be able

553
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,940
to discover those attackers because your

554
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,460
typical basic skills that you started

555
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,860
off with are no longer effective that's

556
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,600
why we cover in the foundations right

557
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,919
you want to do the living off the land

558
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,780
binaries the typical tools that are on

559
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,000
your environment regularly once you're

560
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,679
familiar with those then you can find

561
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,240
those Advanced persistence threats

562
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,500
you'll be able to see things like

563
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,320
indicators of compromise and ttps which

564
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,700
are those tools tactics and procedures

565
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,799
so we had a whole presentation about

566
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,480
China there could be a whole another

567
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,660
presentation about Russia

568
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,980
talking about apts right

569
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,500
thank you

570
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,500
[Music]

571
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,120
speaking of monitoring threats

572
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,340
proactively in real time uh

573
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,879
folks that are out there

574
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,419
sponsors so my vendors on the other side

575
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:42,600
there take note that being said Aaron

576
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,700
from crowdstrike crowdstrike is up there

577
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,039
I've talked about cry strike a lot but

578
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,659
there's so many other platforms out

579
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:50,400
there so if you notice on the

580
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,220
presentation I mentioned edrs so we got

581
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,900
carbon we got carbon black we got

582
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,000
crowdstrike we got cyber reason and we

583
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,340
have opened EDR and and Wazoo so

584
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,200
crowdstrike carbon black and cyber

585
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,960
reason are paid business level EDR

586
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,760
solutions that provide that monitoring

587
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,340
of threats proactively and in real time

588
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,020
so that being said

589
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,240
you want to get that experience using

590
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,860
these platforms or at least one of them

591
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,020
as soon as you can once you get into the

592
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,240
industry because once you know them once

593
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,620
you know one of them you kind of

594
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,679
essentially know them all that on a

595
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:25,140
functional level that being said some of

596
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,840
the tools do have their own syntax but

597
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,520
I've definitely done a lot of this but

598
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,380
big shout out to crowdstrike and Falcon

599
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,419
because their back end is Splunk and

600
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:36,059
Splunk is a their syntax is pretty

601
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:38,039
straightforward and easy to learn

602
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:40,140
that being said there are the paid ones

603
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,539
but Wazoo and open EDR are the free and

604
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:44,700
open source equivalents of EDR solutions

605
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,960
that you can go and leverage in your

606
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,360
environment and with that

607
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,580
we can go and turn that elastic stack

608
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,280
that you started out with into an EDR

609
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,120
solution so

610
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,500
like a cursor here you can see

611
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,600
essentially this is the elastic stack

612
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,539
already all we're doing is adding that

613
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:11,400
additional was a component Wazoo

614
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,860
component and you take your security

615
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,659
operations that you have in your home

616
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:18,840
lab from simple seam monitoring to EDR

617
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,100
you can go and take that endpoint

618
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,200
detection and response and take it to

619
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,179
the next level where now you're not only

620
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:26,640
looking at the Telemetry of your network

621
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,940
data you can also respond you can go and

622
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,880
block a computer you can go and block a

623
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,120
a IP address and also you can see what

624
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,640
applications are doing so once you

625
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,140
actually deploy the elastic stack and

626
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,820
why I think deploying an elastic stack

627
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,500
on your own is so important is because

628
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,600
you start to take security back into

629
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,520
your own hands so all of y'all with

630
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,400
iPhones in your hands you we notice that

631
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,799
the one of the vulnerabilities out on on

632
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,620
the Chinese conference right they had an

633
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,380
apple vulnerability released for three

634
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,960
months before it was was known by Apple

635
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,600
as a company so once you start to take

636
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,340
the security operations route you can

637
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,140
take security back into your own hands

638
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,760
and you could start looking for your own

639
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,919
vulnerabilities and start to be more

640
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:13,919
proactive about your own operations and

641
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,299
what might be going on from the

642
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:17,520
company's perspective and I've noticed a

643
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,620
lot of researchers and developers that's

644
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,240
kind of how they're discovering these

645
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,520
exploits and vulnerabilities is that

646
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,980
they're simply security researchers that

647
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,600
are practicing good operational security

648
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,480
and as such in these vendors products

649
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,880
like an iPhone Android or any software

650
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,159
tool Suite out there they'll apply

651
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:36,840
fuzzing to it or they'll do what they do

652
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,179
with any software and be secure about it

653
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:41,159
and that's when you start to realize

654
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:44,460
that security right is a massive thing

655
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,559
and it's never going to go away and

656
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,539
that's where the paranoia gets built in

657
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:51,240
that being said that's why we want to

658
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,679
take that security back into our own

659
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:55,440
hands so again don't delay start threat

660
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,620
hunting today and if any if you have no

661
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,240
idea what the elastic stack is you don't

662
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,299
know was uh james.com my YouTube channel

663
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:05,340
I've got a nice video that really sums

664
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,500
it all up in about 20 minutes

665
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,240
so that being said now you got those

666
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,980
foundations and you're starting to get

667
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,860
into my bias so my entire presentation

668
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,360
is a little bit leaning more time

669
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,100
towards the blue teamers The Defenders

670
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,140
because that's my my position I'm as an

671
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,520
X-Force interested in response

672
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,559
consultant I do forensics I do that

673
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,779
analysis I do the memory forensics I

674
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:26,940
hunt for those iocs and I use these

675
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,440
tools on the daily

676
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,200
so purple teaming is the the practice of

677
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,679
applying that red team mindset onto a on

678
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:36,659
a environment so you set your virtual

679
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:39,059
machine up or your computer you attack

680
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:41,100
it as if you're a hacker and then you do

681
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,919
forensics on it so you go and you you do

682
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,960
forensics and you see your own steps

683
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,419
that being said the other component of

684
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:50,460
purple teaming that's more reactive is

685
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,679
that you can go in your environment in

686
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:54,059
your corporate environment you set up

687
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:56,400
things like honey pots honey nuts

688
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,880
and you name file names that are really

689
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,299
standard file names that are secrets.txt

690
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:05,419
or something

691
00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:08,580
secrets.txt and the file has rubbish in

692
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,799
it the attackers just because the file

693
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,140
name is Secrets they're curious just

694
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,820
like us humans we're all humans we're

695
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,000
curious we'll clicksecrets.txt just to

696
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,039
see what it is so when you have your

697
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:22,200
automated red team or School skills and

698
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,820
some things along those lines and you

699
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,559
deploy your honey pots your honey Nets

700
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:28,440
you can deploy these these

701
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,380
fake files or trigger files essentially

702
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,679
that'll trigger your EDR platform to say

703
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:36,480
all right this flag was hit your

704
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,340
attackers in your environment let's get

705
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,240
to work

706
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,220
that being said there's a component of

707
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,020
the reactive side now

708
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,360
and doing forensics forensics is a whole

709
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,919
nother thing in dead box forensics

710
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:48,539
there's dead box forensics there's live

711
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:51,000
forensics there's memory forensics So

712
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,559
within dead box forensics there's a lot

713
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,940
of forensic artifacts your computers

714
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,460
right your iPhones what are what is the

715
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,320
actually behind the operating system so

716
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,059
some of those artifacts are the registry

717
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:02,520
event logs amcash anybody know registry

718
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,080
event logs

719
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,240
some of them I'm trying to see who my

720
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,500
blue teamers are looks like you got a

721
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,299
lot of red teamers out instead

722
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:11,700
that being said Now Memory forensics is

723
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,760
the live system so back in the day in

724
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,260
forensics and incident response they

725
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,059
used to say pull the plug they just turn

726
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:19,500
the computer off that's it you're done

727
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,500
however now we know that there's a lot

728
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,419
of data that you lose when you pull the

729
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:25,980
plug you're naughty or theft thank you

730
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,919
so when you pull the plug you lose the

731
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:31,140
live data of memory so memory forensics

732
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,120
and using a tool like volatility

733
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,799
I don't think I'm behind it but

734
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,779
volatility is a free open source tool

735
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:39,539
that allows you to read memory live and

736
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:42,120
you can see Active network connections

737
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,340
active processes running things that you

738
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,900
wouldn't be able to see

739
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,820
if you pulled the plug now this is so

740
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,640
important because attackers do things

741
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,400
like file lists malware so you'll only

742
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,320
be able to catch the attacker sometimes

743
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,840
in memory if they're a very

744
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,000
sophisticated attacker that will be the

745
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,919
only time that you can catch them in

746
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:05,640
memory so memory forensics is a thing do

747
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,020
not go pulling the plugs on your

748
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,460
computers if there's an attacker because

749
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,279
you'll lose great forensic data

750
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,100
you never know what data you'll have so

751
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,440
that being said make plug for some of

752
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,760
these free and open source tools that

753
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,580
I've I leverage on The Daily autopsies a

754
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,299
forensic Suite ftk is a forensic tweet

755
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:26,039
recon's a nice tool for for mounting

756
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:28,080
images and perusing them like a write

757
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,360
blocker similarly to kind of the USB

758
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,220
right blocker that I showcased and we

759
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,740
have Loki Loki is a really great simple

760
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,559
ioc and IR scanner and what that Loki

761
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:39,960
does is it uses those signatures those

762
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,820
indicators of compromise those Yara

763
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,460
rules that we know about so all of these

764
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,840
exploits and vulnerabilities that are

765
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,580
commonly known already the things we

766
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,900
know attackers are doing this the

767
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,760
exploits we already know exist

768
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,100
they have signatures we have rules those

769
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,539
are the low-hanging fruit that you can

770
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:56,940
apply Loki on a forensic image too and

771
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,679
you'll pull them out easy another great

772
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:00,059
way for you to sift through your

773
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:03,779
forensic data in an easier fashion

774
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:05,640
so that being said I've covered quite a

775
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,620
bit here I've covered a lot of good uh

776
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,480
niches and subtopics on those individual

777
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,700
slides so you start with computer

778
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,320
networking right computer networking

779
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,480
networking system administration and

780
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,860
those are foundations so if you're going

781
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,039
from Zero to Hero right not hero to

782
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:22,740
superhero but Zero to Hero you start

783
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,120
with your foundations and that's that

784
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,080
computer networking Network

785
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,779
Administration and then maybe you spend

786
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:30,720
a year or maybe a few months on that you

787
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,520
take a you take a pause break and

788
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,559
reinforcement

789
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,179
Master those three animation because

790
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:38,460
once you do then you could go in further

791
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,260
down the road to security operations

792
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,580
that way when you're doing incident

793
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,440
response you got your elastic stack set

794
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,240
up you're looking in your your seam

795
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,460
you're looking at Falcon you know what

796
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,840
you're looking at and you could see

797
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,200
what's normal from what's evil

798
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,200
and then maybe incident response you

799
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,940
spend five years doing that you're five

800
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,860
years seeing in the environment and you

801
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,360
get bored with it because essentially

802
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,240
another thing that attackers do some of

803
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,220
these Nation governments they are not

804
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,380
looking to obfuscate so much once they

805
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,179
their their end goal might be to steal

806
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:12,120
data or deploy ransomware

807
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,799
they might be obfuscated in the

808
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:15,539
beginning but then afterwards when

809
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:16,799
they're at that stage of deploying

810
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,659
ransomware they don't care they're going

811
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:20,220
to make a lot of noise and you'll be

812
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,480
able to see it

813
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,000
so essentially an instant response you

814
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,799
see the attackers doing the same thing

815
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:28,200
you see a lot of c2s you see a lot of

816
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,760
Metasploit you see a lot of cobalt

817
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,340
strike and things along those lines so

818
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,960
they all do the same thing and it kind

819
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,220
of gets boring

820
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,100
I am not as an intermediate astronaut in

821
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,080
the previous slide right

822
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,000
I can't even imagine this being boring

823
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,460
however some of the folks that have been

824
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,679
in the industry for five maybe uh eight

825
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,360
ten years they start to get bored with

826
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,159
it and then they'll go and they'll

827
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,960
switch from the blue team's side to the

828
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,000
red teaming side and that's where they

829
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,799
start to do that purple teaming and then

830
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:57,539
maybe they might get into digital

831
00:30:57,539 --> 00:30:59,159
forensics so maybe they don't get bored

832
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:01,620
but new technology comes out so like an

833
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,779
iPhone iPhone forensics is totally

834
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:06,299
different from computer forensics heck

835
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,340
Apple forensics is completely different

836
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,260
from Windows forensics because those are

837
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,659
two different operating systems not to

838
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:15,720
mention the Linux operating system too

839
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,940
so that being said once you do get to

840
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,740
that point there's no turn back

841
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:23,760
so once you're at that point it's all

842
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,380
about leveling up it's all about

843
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,480
learning new tools building your toolbox

844
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,299
and for what I do as incident response

845
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:31,860
kind of like what you what it sounds

846
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,260
like incident response is when your your

847
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,480
company or your client their hair is on

848
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,419
fire it's the hacking's going on there's

849
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:40,919
a threat in their environment they're

850
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:42,179
scared they don't know what to do

851
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:43,679
they're not the experts they don't

852
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,240
they're not they don't might not have a

853
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,980
security operations team it could be a

854
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,779
small Mom and Pop shop for all we know

855
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:51,480
and they don't have the security mindset

856
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,039
or the headset that we do so as an

857
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,200
incident response consultant one of the

858
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,480
things that I get to be able to do is to

859
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,520
come in with that process and procedure

860
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,260
and that crisis management mindset we

861
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,360
get to calm them down and say don't

862
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,659
worry we got this settle down relax a

863
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:08,520
little bit focus on the things that are

864
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,279
important your your monetary losses your

865
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,440
HR your sales the things that you might

866
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,899
not have worried or set up about because

867
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:17,460
your incident response plan might have

868
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,140
not been developed

869
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,840
so that being said if you really like

870
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,399
instant response if you really like

871
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,080
Aaron's presentation learning about

872
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,299
Chinese like the Chinese threat actors

873
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:29,399
and and threat threat hunting and threat

874
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:30,779
intelligence you might want to be an

875
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:32,580
incident response analyst the next

876
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,140
presentation afterwards talks about

877
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,360
ransomware and a lot more about threat

878
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,500
hunting and threat intelligence talking

879
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,779
about c2s and really identifying those

880
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:42,480
attackers if you love all of these these

881
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,980
presentations and that's what you want

882
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,200
to do that little spark inside of you

883
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,760
starts to ignite and you're like that's

884
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,860
it I don't want to do red teaming I

885
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,940
don't want to be offensive security

886
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,220
right now I want to be a Defender I want

887
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,840
to be a blue teamer

888
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,820
this is the that's the route you'll go

889
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,919
and it'll be talking about that mindset

890
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:01,500
taking care of instant response because

891
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,480
as an analyst right your entry level

892
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,120
maybe you're first on the job and and

893
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,620
you're the incident response analyst

894
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,299
you're going to be nervous too because

895
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:11,880
it's your first engagement however you

896
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,860
can't let the client know that and I

897
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,380
learned that firsthand so always cover

898
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,320
your mindset crisis management and once

899
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,760
you have your foundations and you have

900
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,620
the elastic stack the elastic stack

901
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,480
setting up a home lab is a perfect thing

902
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,340
to put on your resume and to talk about

903
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:29,039
in interviews so at that stage if you

904
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,240
don't already have a job you can

905
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,860
leverage all that experience for finding

906
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,380
a job and finding a team that fits

907
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,059
and at this stage as well you can see

908
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:38,039
your potential in what's next while also

909
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:39,600
being able to appreciate how far you've

910
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,419
come because you have that techno site

911
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:44,519
and you'll be able to see

912
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:45,899
all these things that you didn't see

913
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:48,299
before you'll be what I would be calling

914
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:49,500
a

915
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,140
not average but a Advanced Consumer

916
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,299
compared to a lot of other folks who

917
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:55,559
don't care about security right the

918
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:56,880
biggest thing about cyber security is

919
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,559
making people care about cyber security

920
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,200
and communicating it in a fun way but

921
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,480
Mom and Dad they don't really care they

922
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,500
don't really know about cyber security

923
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,559
as much as say say we do so at that

924
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,359
point right it's our job to be able to

925
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,300
go and practice that growth and protect

926
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,040
them so

927
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,899
instant response analyst if you're all

928
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:18,179
into defending hit me up because that's

929
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:19,679
what I do and I'd be happy to help you

930
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,839
all get into the industry

931
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,580
that being said I'm going to talk a

932
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,139
little bit about finding a job in some

933
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:26,699
of the easier ways for you to get break

934
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:28,379
into the industry right so if you don't

935
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:31,379
have any experience maybe you're well

936
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:33,418
we're all at root con so this is a

937
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:35,040
primary opportunity for you to go and

938
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,540
perform some networking you can go and

939
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,918
talk to folks that you're sitting next

940
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,159
to go and network with folks that are at

941
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:43,379
the table the vendor the booths Folks at

942
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:45,060
the vendor booths they might be selling

943
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,320
their products but maybe they have some

944
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,820
position openings so if you have your

945
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,619
resume in the back pocket you can go and

946
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:52,139
slide that under the radar there and

947
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:53,580
tell them hey I'm looking for a position

948
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,280
of things along those lines now I keep

949
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,720
on saying I'm going to say it again

950
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,480
having your home lab having a testing

951
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,160
and practice environment for your own

952
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,040
purposes is such an invaluable thing to

953
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,040
have and really in order for you to be

954
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,720
in the industry for longer than five

955
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,240
years I think it's a must in my opinion

956
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,579
so far and I'm kind of reaching that

957
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,920
stage I think you have to have a home

958
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,280
lab why because in order for you to

959
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,500
practice these these new exploits these

960
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,880
new vulnerabilities you need to have a

961
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,400
safe area to play around a safe area to

962
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,900
practice those red teaming skills you

963
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,180
learn a safe area to detect new

964
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,160
detections to build detections for a

965
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,920
falcon new detections for Wazoo in order

966
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,040
for you to to Really Advance you need a

967
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,200
play environment it's it's a playground

968
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,280
really

969
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,020
which is another reason why I love cyber

970
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,640
security I feel like I'm still a kid up

971
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,040
here that being said there's a lot of

972
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,140
free resources out there as well a lot

973
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,000
of my presentation I cover about some of

974
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,460
these uh page Suites about cyber reason

975
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,900
things along those lines carbon black

976
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,460
but there's a lot of free resources out

977
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,260
there as well I mentioned them as well

978
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,880
in the presentation Alaska stack but

979
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,940
Sans is really the the organization

980
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,500
that's very well known

981
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,359
for producing information security

982
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:09,480
training and they do a lot of their

983
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,680
their defending training they're known

984
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,780
for the blue teaming training The

985
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,820
Defenders training versus offensive

986
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:18,300
security the folks that are over at oscp

987
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,400
behind the wall they focus a little bit

988
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,079
more on red team and offensive security

989
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,700
hence the name

990
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,619
that being said Sans has a lot of paid

991
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:27,000
training but they have a lot of free

992
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,400
posters and things along those lines so

993
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,740
a lot of words that I've used like no

994
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,960
normal and find evil that's actually the

995
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,839
title of a Sans poster that I use on The

996
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:38,040
Daily

997
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,500
there is so much forensic artifacts and

998
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,180
good forensic knowledge on those posters

999
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,820
that at some point I'm going to print

1000
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,440
them out and I'm going to put them on my

1001
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,640
bedroom wall

1002
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,619
kids have Captain America on their wall

1003
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:51,960
I'll have that too but those those Sans

1004
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,780
posters those are going up for sure

1005
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,579
so that being said if y'all are looking

1006
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:58,440
for for a job opportunity or anything

1007
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,420
along those lines or you want to to

1008
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,280
build your your elastic Sack or build

1009
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,140
your resume up a little bit feel free to

1010
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,599
reach out to me because I personally do

1011
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,220
have that experience back at Camp champ

1012
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,440
I was a peer career coach in college so

1013
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,180
I'll be able to do all that resume

1014
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,700
finessing cover letter room and and show

1015
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,500
you all that building LinkedIn and

1016
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,700
networking and get you a job sorted

1017
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,220
so that being said

1018
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,020
even though you might have your job

1019
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,780
already I've got my job everybody in the

1020
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,520
industry experiences imposter syndrome

1021
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,920
and I talked a little bit about mental

1022
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,660
health but I want to talk about imposter

1023
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,940
syndrome specifically because even being

1024
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,680
up on this stage

1025
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,079
it feels like I don't belong being here

1026
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,060
there are folks that are 10 times better

1027
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,560
than me they might know a lot better

1028
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,619
than me but I realize that

1029
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:49,020
essentially imposter syndrome actually

1030
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,940
is a good thing you have to fight that

1031
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,640
fear because it's a response for your

1032
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,079
growth so once you actually start to

1033
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:57,480
feel that imposter syndrome you can

1034
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,980
actually start to appreciate it because

1035
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,540
you're like all right

1036
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,400
I feel like an imposter I'm doing

1037
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,960
something right then

1038
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,200
so key elements to tackle that is really

1039
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,880
to just have that plan you got to

1040
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,619
visualize success the fact that we

1041
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:12,599
acknowledge our potential makes it that

1042
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:14,760
much closer to reality

1043
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,020
so

1044
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,480
all of our heroes as well right starting

1045
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,820
out they weren't who they were that we

1046
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,099
know them today Captain America he did

1047
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:25,440
not have the hammer until maybe Avengers

1048
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,000
Age of Ultron

1049
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
or so the Russo say but in endgame we

1050
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,400
saw him rock mill near and really go to

1051
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,619
town with that Batman the new Batman

1052
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:37,220
movie we see a younger more grittier

1053
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,900
Batman and

1054
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,660
anybody know Don muchi by chance all

1055
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,560
right I'm not gonna explain that

1056
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,060
reference then

1057
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,920
so as you get better

1058
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,240
that means your problems are going to

1059
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,339
get harder that's the nature of growth

1060
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:52,740
you know as you become a better hero the

1061
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,740
villains get stronger and as any

1062
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,140
troubleshooting any problem solving it's

1063
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,200
as simple as just breaking it down

1064
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,300
he got a big problem split it up into

1065
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,880
two parts split those two parts up and

1066
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,839
you just

1067
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:09,180
break any big problem you might have

1068
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,800
anything that's making you nervous

1069
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,020
anything that you might have an idea

1070
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:16,440
that's that's big and causing you any

1071
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,240
issues or anything along those lines any

1072
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,940
any illusions of grandiosity you can go

1073
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,680
and break them down into those smaller

1074
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,380
chunks that way you can go and Tackle

1075
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,420
them one at a time when you're getting a

1076
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,859
pizza right you don't eat the whole

1077
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:33,020
thing you eat that one slice at a time

1078
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,040
so at this point right we're basically

1079
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,380
covered through the intermediate but you

1080
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,520
notice I didn't really get into the

1081
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,160
advanced stage too much but there's a

1082
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,220
reason that for that so let's go once

1083
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,660
you have those foundations you got those

1084
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,820
generic knowledge going on you can go

1085
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,740
and learn all the things so you ever

1086
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,660
Padawan night now now you can go and

1087
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,820
become that Jedi Master things that

1088
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,680
require what folks would say quote

1089
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,980
unquote Advanced research and getting to

1090
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,599
this point right it takes time you have

1091
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:02,579
to be patient with yourself you can go

1092
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:04,800
forensics all the things you can learn

1093
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,660
reverse engineering red teaming and

1094
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,880
exploit development all of the things I

1095
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,339
talked about they have they're all

1096
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:14,160
niches and industries of themselves so

1097
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,380
there's no way for you to go and Master

1098
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,320
One Thing Really unless you spend the

1099
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,119
time to master it

1100
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,000
there's a saying of Jack of all trades

1101
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,400
master of none as an incident response

1102
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,900
analyst I'm a bit of a generalist

1103
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,460
because that's kind of what we have to

1104
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,940
be in order to detect attackers so Jack

1105
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,099
of all trades master of none it's a good

1106
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:38,099
thing mom and dad didn't call me Jack

1107
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:40,920
no offenses to any Jacks out there

1108
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,440
that being said we also have Niche gfir

1109
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,359
so even in digital forensic synonym

1110
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,780
response I'm an IR analyst and these are

1111
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,640
these subtopics that you can really

1112
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,200
focus and become an expert in in

1113
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,700
themselves so these are the things that

1114
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,380
you can go in the industry you spend 10

1115
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,640
years in the industry you can go and

1116
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,800
focus on things like industrial Control

1117
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,180
Systems we've talked about like

1118
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,760
airplanes aviations drones mobile

1119
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,880
devices iPhone forensics iot your fridge

1120
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,680
will get hacked next year who knows your

1121
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,180
thermostat The Nest Thermostat you got

1122
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,000
iot applied every day everywhere cloud

1123
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,680
cloud security Cloud forensics

1124
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,839
blockchain how many of y'all are on the

1125
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,300
blockchain Bitcoin there we go all right

1126
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,400
there's so many in niches in cyber

1127
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,800
security cyber security has a as a

1128
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,320
problem of of hiring we need more folks

1129
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,900
to be able to be Defenders and and all

1130
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,579
of these niches as well there's not

1131
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:31,440
enough support within them and that

1132
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,540
being said if furthermore technology is

1133
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,880
still progressing more technology is on

1134
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,920
the way Quantum Computing AI machine

1135
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,240
learning

1136
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,119
the future is wild but it's going to be

1137
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:44,339
a really fun one

1138
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:46,079
so you notice I'll have

1139
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,020
in quotes why is advanced in quotes

1140
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,060
it's because I've noticed

1141
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,980
nobody in the industry considers

1142
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,920
themselves Advanced so

1143
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,960
I noticed nobody really raised their

1144
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,220
hands when I asked anybody who was

1145
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,780
Advanced and that's because of the fact

1146
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,599
that we have that imposter syndrome but

1147
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,760
also because of the fact that becoming

1148
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,800
an expert in the security takes time so

1149
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,420
when you do get to that point in which

1150
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,220
you might feel like or you can consider

1151
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,420
yourself a little bit more advanced

1152
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,500
because you've been in the industry so

1153
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,119
long

1154
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,760
you can go and and kind of consider

1155
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,320
yourself a little bit of a wizard or

1156
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,359
other folks that don't have that

1157
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:22,980
experience they'll look at you like

1158
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,420
you're a God you have all this

1159
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,460
experience all this knowledge all of

1160
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,320
these new things that we don't that I

1161
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,480
don't know to do you're you're a wizard

1162
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,880
like it's insane and you really start to

1163
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,339
to put people on a pedestal

1164
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:36,660
one of the things I've really learned

1165
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,339
within the past couple years is to stop

1166
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:40,680
doing that and the reason for that is

1167
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,680
because security is needs to stop being

1168
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,660
Wizards trying to impress other Wizards

1169
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,940
so John strand who was an old Santa

1170
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,260
structure but he has his own company

1171
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,760
Black Hills information security anybody

1172
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,619
know John strand

1173
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:55,320
some folks all right so John strand he's

1174
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,180
got this tweet and I I've rocked this

1175
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,980
down because it's it's a really good

1176
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:01,560
good sentence that just hits home the

1177
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,119
point that I'm making security needs to

1178
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,800
stop being Wizards trying to impress

1179
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,839
other Wizards and I love it because he

1180
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:08,940
says focus on the fundamentals because

1181
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,460
the fundamentals never change think TCP

1182
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:14,040
on IP all of your network protocols

1183
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,500
they're built on the essential function

1184
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,260
stack of that and you can you can go and

1185
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:21,359
you can read rfcs for protocols or

1186
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,940
requests for comments which are the big

1187
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,040
long documents that are on the internet

1188
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,200
that detail how these new Protocols are

1189
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,520
getting created and things along those

1190
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,579
lines so your iPhone has AirPlay and and

1191
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:34,560
car playing things along those lines you

1192
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,079
can learn how that is being leveraged

1193
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:40,380
and built on top of the TCP model

1194
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,599
so let's recap because I think I got a

1195
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:44,640
couple minutes here uh and and we're

1196
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,800
getting made really good timing here but

1197
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,140
covered a lot in the presentation this

1198
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:51,660
slide that that the right portion of it

1199
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,940
if you noticed it's literally just

1200
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:56,220
everything from the slides all put on

1201
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,740
this one slide cyber security is such a

1202
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,079
big industry then you can go and fall

1203
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:03,180
down the rabbit hole or the the funnel

1204
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:07,260
in this case and and land anywhere so

1205
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,839
once you start out like I said it's a

1206
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:11,460
lifelong adventure of learning cyber

1207
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,619
security and digital forensic sentence

1208
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:15,540
response you master your foundations

1209
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:18,300
your fundamentals you'll learn a little

1210
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,819
bit about everything to cover everything

1211
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:23,220
below so computer networking you'll go

1212
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:24,599
down you learn about Network system

1213
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:26,400
administration then you go into security

1214
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,140
operations then you'll go to purple

1215
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,880
teaming and then you could go to dfir

1216
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,400
and then you could go and do niches so

1217
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,579
going from Zero to Hero

1218
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:37,619
allows you to become a generalist at

1219
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:40,980
first and then specific and then just

1220
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,560
like Captain America you'll feel a

1221
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,300
little bit worthy or in the case of Thor

1222
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,280
he needs a new Hammer you'll get that

1223
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,900
lightning strike and the fire inside

1224
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,520
will keep on burning and you'll next

1225
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,960
thing you know it'll be one of y'all up

1226
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,780
here at rucan

1227
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:55,980
that being said I'll pitched a little

1228
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,180
bit

1229
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,779
so I've got a YouTube

1230
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,740
service offerings and things along those

1231
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,900
lines so if you ever find yourself in

1232
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,640
your iPhone acting a little weird maybe

1233
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,020
you feel like you need a little instant

1234
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:08,460
response going on your computer's been

1235
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,440
hacked and and you don't want to go and

1236
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,119
pay for a big company like IBM or

1237
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:13,200
something along those lines because

1238
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,760
those companies really cater to

1239
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,740

maybe you don't want you just to do the

1243
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:25,260
elastic stack maybe you also want to do

1244
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,940
a red teaming environment as well so you

1245
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,220
can start hacking and attacking I can
