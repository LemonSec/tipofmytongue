1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,360
hi I'm Chester wisneski principal

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,480
research scientist at Sophos bringing a

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,680
presentation to you today called

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,720
building defensive playbooks from others

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,120
Misfortune and what I'm trying to do

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,099
here is share from a lot of other folks

7
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,279
experiences a bit of what has led them

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,740
to become victims so that we can try to

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,720
kind of extract from that the most

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,699
common ways or the common mistakes that

11
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,680
organizations are making how we might

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,060
learn from that to improve our own

13
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,180
defensive playbooks uh I'm sorry am I

14
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,380
able to join you all in the Philippines

15
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,880
I'm really happy to be able to present

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,500
this is my first root con and hopefully

17
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll be able to be with you in the

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,420
future to join you in person but for now

19
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,399
we're gonna we're gonna go with zoom I

20
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:42,300
want to give you a little background

21
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,100
info just briefly

22
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,079
um sofas we're a global security company

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,120
if you're not familiar with us and where

24
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,860
this information is coming from is a lot

25
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,180
of my experience working with our

26
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,940
customers our partners all around the

27
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,860
world and you know we're we're working

28
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,899
with over 500 000 companies so we have

29
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,879
this incredibly Rich set of data that we

30
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:01,260
can work from to kind of

31
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,180
you can take the Pulse if you will

32
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,680
what's going on in information security

33
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,960
and it's incredibly helpful and my job

34
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,640
at the company is actually to liaise

35
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,619
with all of our researchers around the

36
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,119
world so you know we've got over 200

37
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,119
people in our research labs sophosaxops

38
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,860
and you know some of them are working on

39
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,420
artificial intelligence and some of them

40
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,100
work on web threats and some work on

41
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,080
malware and you know some work on email

42
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,340
protection all these different things

43
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,860
and so I have the privilege of kind of

44
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,900
working with all those folks to collect

45
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,759
sort of the most interesting things and

46
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,320
trends that they're all observing in

47
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,600
their small little micro areas where

48
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,280
they're really deep experts and then

49
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,840
taking all that information and kind of

50
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,100
putting it together to get a better

51
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,140
understanding of the big picture of

52
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,400
what's really happening in information

53
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,159
security to real organizations and not

54
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,780
just the stuff we have a tendency to

55
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,520
hear about in the headlines I think

56
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,740
we're all really super fascinated with

57
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,659
the news headlines when we hear about a

58
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,520
really sophisticated hack but of course

59
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,439
most of the time that's not actually

60
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,640
what's happening to the average

61
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,880
organization out there and uh it's sexy

62
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,079
and cool and interesting and we all love

63
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,759
here hearing about the latest zero-day

64
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:03,960
vulnerability at our security

65
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,299
conferences but the truth of the matter

66
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,459
is infosec day-to-day is quite different

67
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,340
than that and being able to look at all

68
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,840
the bits of information we get from all

69
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,459
around the world is helping paint a much

70
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:15,900
more detailed picture of what's really

71
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,900
happening to organizations so that

72
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,640
um those of us fortunately that have

73
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,319
enough security staff that care can

74
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,700
start to take some notes from that and

75
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,080
learn from it to hopefully improve our

76
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,580
own security

77
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,400
so this most this information I'm

78
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,440
talking about today is from what we call

79
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,300
our active adversary Playbook that we

80
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,080
published recently and this covered 144

81
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,480
incidents where somebody was impacted by

82
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,400
malware and our incident response team

83
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,739
was able to go in determine what

84
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:45,900
happened do all the forensics write the

85
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,500
report uh and extract from that sort of

86
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,900
the the details or the root cause

87
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,120
analysis of what caused this breach to

88
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,680
begin with and what kind of damage was

89
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,480
done and what what behaviors were

90
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,160
employed by the attackers that kind of

91
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,540
thing and you can see it's quite diverse

92
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,000
although you know by country if you look

93
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,739
at the pie chart there you know the vast

94
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,780
majority of the victims more than half

95
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,239
are from the United States knowing that

96
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:11,000
we're presenting here in the Philippines

97
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,159
Philippines is two of the 144 cases

98
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,720
which is why Philippines listed there as

99
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,340
one percent so obviously it's not

100
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,620
specific to the Philippines but one of

101
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,200
the interesting things that came of this

102
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,420
actually looking at it from a Global

103
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,000
Perspective with the the report its

104
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,700
author was we didn't see really any

105
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,519
variability globally

106
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,900
like about the kind of mistakes people

107
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,940
were making or we didn't see the

108
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,739
criminals behave in a different way when

109
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,019
they attacked a German Bank than when

110
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,360
they attacked an American manufacturing

111
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,239
facility most of these attacks are

112
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,519
pretty much all from the same attacker

113
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,440
Playbook if you will and it really

114
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,239
doesn't matter what the geography of the

115
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,040
victim is in fact about the only thing

116
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,440
that is really different about victims

117
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,659
in different countries at least amongst

118
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,879
this data set is the price that Ransom

119
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,700
was paid clearly the the Americans were

120
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,319
targeted with the highest Ransom dollar

121
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,760
amounts and other countries

122
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,680
proportionally were often smaller dollar

123
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,620
amounts based on their ability to pay

124
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,019
but uh beyond that there isn't a lot of

125
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,459
difference when we look at it by Country

126
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,199
Now we will see quite a lot of

127
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,699
difference when we look at it by the

128
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:20,519
size of an organization I mean you can

129
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,560
see the distribution of the customers

130
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,660
here is largely under 5 000 right

131
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,240
there's a only a couple I think it was

132
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,800
three in the data set that were over

133
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,080
five thousand most of the organizations

134
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,780
here are between

135
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,000
one and three thousand employees but

136
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,800
it's quite evenly distributed amongst

137
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,840
them so there's there's enough data

138
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,160
there that it does actually get kind of

139
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,680
interesting to see how different sized

140
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,139
organizations are able to respond and

141
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:49,560
detect uh to uh infection incidents

142
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,320
largely ransomware and again quite

143
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,020
diverse when we look by sector there are

144
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,940
some Variations by sector in this data

145
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,979
set it's quite small so I'm not going to

146
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:00,240
spend a lot of time talking about

147
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,820
sectors but if you kind of project from

148
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,900
your own

149
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,080
um intuition of which organizations are

150
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,060
likely best and worst you're probably

151
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,000
correct based on other research sets

152
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,220
that I commonly work with in my role day

153
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,320
today

154
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,940
organizations that are in finance and

155
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,759
military defense are often at the least

156
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,800
victimized end of the spectrum and

157
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,440
organizations like Municipal governments

158
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,620
or cities school districts and

159
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,539
Healthcare organizations that have very

160
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,000
tight budgets don't invest a lot in

161
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,620
security often are victimized more

162
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,039
frequently

163
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,720
so I'm going to start out the first half

164
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,639
of our presentation today talking about

165
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,160
how we fail in order to learn from how

166
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,840
we're failing and figure out the things

167
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,180
that are going to be most effective to

168
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,740
prevent the failure we need to kind of

169
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,539
do a bit of Naval gazing and look into

170
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:54,360
why we're failing to begin with so uh if

171
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,220
as we look into the root causes of

172
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,840
attacks there's a lot of ways to look at

173
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,240
this information now my my least

174
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,860
favorite thing about this statistic here

175
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,139
on the screen is that unknown is 36

176
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,820
percent and that sounds bad but I'll

177
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,220
explain it a little more detail clearly

178
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,560
the most obvious thing here is exploited

179
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,960
vulnerability is almost exactly half of

180
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,360
the incidents that we investigate and

181
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,919
while there's some variability in what

182
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,440
those vulnerabilities are none of them

183
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,139
in our experience in any of this data

184
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,780
set were zero days they were all patched

185
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,880
vulnerabilities that just had not been

186
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,220
patched by the organization they may

187
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,660
have been partially patched in some

188
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,180
instances where perhaps they had five

189
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,160
exchange servers and one of them got

190
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,680
missed in applying patches they might

191
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,419
not have been patched at all which was

192
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,759
much more common with things like VPN

193
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,419
concentrators or remote access devices

194
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:47,400
but all of those patches were had been

195
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,500
available for some time and in many

196
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,139
cases months or even years

197
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:55,680
now the ones other than unknown uh

198
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,600
fishing brute force and compromise

199
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,220
credentials you could kind of lump

200
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,500
together because they're all about

201
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,699
stealing passwords whether they did it

202
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:04,380
through a phishing attack or whether

203
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,440
they got the password from the LinkedIn

204
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,720
data breach eight years ago or whether

205
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,699
they just simply guessed passwords in a

206
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:14,400
Brute Force attack in the end those were

207
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,560
all from compromised credentials let's

208
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,319
call it and put them together uh in that

209
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,840
sort of 16 percent there the the one

210
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,340
percent that's download is almost

211
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,039
entirely uh email threats right so when

212
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:27,660
we say download we think of going to

213
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,460
perhaps a malicious website but it's

214
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,520
usually not that uh the email leads you

215
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,440
to a link where ultimately you download

216
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,860
the malicious code because

217
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,840
uh typically organizations have much

218
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,639
stronger security at their email Gateway

219
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,500
like every email attachment goes through

220
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,199
a filter but as many of us work remotely

221
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,720
especially since the on on set of covet

222
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,360
and things it not every user necessarily

223
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,220
has a web filter front of them one day

224
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,660
they may when they're in the office and

225
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,639
another day they may be at a cafe and

226
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,199
another day they may be at home on their

227
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:01,280
own Wi-Fi and so the universal

228
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,199
application of web filtering is not as

229
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,360
uh is applied there as it is for email

230
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,699
every one of my emails gets scanned but

231
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:10,319
only some of my web traffic gets scanned

232
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,240
so the criminals have caught on to that

233
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,400
and don't use necessarily as malicious

234
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,259
attachments as much anymore as they

235
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:17,940
might redirect you to a web link where

236
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,919
there's a malicious ending for you to

237
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,720
download something as opposed to sending

238
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,759
as an attachment now that 36 percent

239
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,080
unknown

240
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,599
is sort of a legal thing we never came

241
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,400
to a legal conclusion as to how the

242
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,319
incident started but the vast majority

243
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,599
of those We Believe were compromise

244
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,159
credentials

245
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,620
um so we can kind of assume that

246
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,899
probably 80 or more of those in my

247
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:42,479
understanding were believed to be

248
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,860
compromised credentials but we couldn't

249
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,020
identify where the credential was stolen

250
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,540
and so in our official reports we were

251
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,680
never able to tell the victim

252
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,560
necessarily that this was for sure a

253
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,600
stolen admin password for example so

254
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,640
they do remain unknown but personally I

255
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,160
feel that if we have to rank the things

256
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,680
that cause these attacks it's absolutely

257
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,540
number one is vulnerabilities and then

258
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,279
right behind it is some sort of stolen

259
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,720
credential whether it was fished or

260
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,100
whether it was a reused password or

261
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,140
something similar and then in distant

262
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,060
third it's some sort of email-born

263
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,680
threat whether it was an attachment or

264
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,660
them leading to a download and there's

265
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,200
almost no other uh things that uh cause

266
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,760
these attacks that's that's kind of

267
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,140
pretty much gives you the hundred

268
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,820
percent

269
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,720
so another thing to see here and I think

270
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,279
this is pretty interesting is the

271
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,220
attacker dwell time and uh in most of

272
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,240
these statistics throughout the

273
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,440
presentation I'm going to quote the

274
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,060
median dwell time and if you don't

275
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,320
remember that from when we were in

276
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,240
mathematics in grade school if you take

277
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,700
the average of course you're taking some

278
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,560
extremes into account that have a

279
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,560
tendency to sway where what that number

280
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,140
is so for example the longest dwell time

281
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,320
was over 420 days that attackers were in

282
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,540
a network in one of the victims and the

283
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,339
shortest dwell time was about 90 minutes

284
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,500
and when we put all those together it

285
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,500
has a tendency to skew the the number

286
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,440
away from what the truth is and what we

287
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,300
actually see in victims day to day so

288
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,800
what we look at is instead the median

289
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,959
which is the middle number of the entire

290
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:12,060
data set and when we look at the median

291
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,660
it was about 15 days uh that the the

292
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,519
criminals were inside the victims

293
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,839
Network before either the malware was

294
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,519
triggered like ransomware or an

295
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,680
encryption happened or when the victim

296
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,019
determined that an attacker was in and

297
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:30,180
kicked them out but little over two

298
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,320
weeks

299
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,300
when we're talking about non-ransomware

300
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,339
though that number jumps up to 34 days

301
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:37,080
so I I think this is kind of interesting

302
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,300
which is you know when a ransomware

303
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,800
attack has happened because it's in your

304
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,779
face right you get a note with a skull

305
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:45,300
and crossbones demanding your money so

306
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,500
it's not like it's something you don't

307
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,839
know happened at there's some end point

308
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:50,339
that you clearly have detected it

309
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:53,160
whether you were looking or not whereas

310
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,640
if I infect your Linux servers your web

311
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,320
servers maybe something in the cloud

312
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,800
with a crypto Miner I'm going to largely

313
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,260
stay there as long as I possibly can and

314
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,000
you may not notice it may not cause

315
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,700
enough performance degradation it may be

316
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,040
that you get a bill from Amazon for ten

317
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,480
thousand dollars

318
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,760
and you go oh my God why is that so high

319
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,800
and now you find the cryptoware so it's

320
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,360
interesting to me that it's 34 days

321
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,040
because it's just more than a month it

322
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,440
literally is like one billing period of

323
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,160
your Azure or your AWS that you were

324
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,720
infected and then of course that was

325
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,339
your tip off that something was terribly

326
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:30,779
wrong when you got this big bill for

327
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:34,860
making ethereum and uh I'm not saying

328
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,019
all of those are crypto miners but when

329
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:40,019
we take out ransomware from the data set

330
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:42,420
the remaining ones are largely crypto

331
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,279
miners info Steelers and a few other

332
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:47,160
things ransomwares clearly the dominant

333
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,880
uh malware in the data set and

334
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,980
if it turns out

335
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,140
they're stealing your data let's say

336
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,579
you're able to detect it at that point

337
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:57,899
I'll talk about this a little bit later

338
00:11:57,899 --> 00:11:59,160
in the presentation because I think it's

339
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,500
a good thing to Target as another Last

340
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,540
Chance opportunity to stop an attack in

341
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,120
progress before it's too late uh it's

342
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,860
four days on average between when they

343
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,540
start siphoning off all your sensitive

344
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,279
files to when they trigger the

345
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,720
ransomware and start encrypting

346
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,579
everything so there's still a reasonable

347
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:16,380
amount of time there if you're good at

348
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,940
threat hunting and you're actively

349
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,440
watching for bad things that may be

350
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,720
happening within your network these

351
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,880
times um sound terrible but to me these

352
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,160
are optimistic I'm going I've got two

353
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,480
whole weeks to look for threat

354
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,240
indicators before bad things are likely

355
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,680
to happen so if I'm doing this well

356
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,120
that's plenty of time for my team to be

357
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,620
able to detect and respond to an

358
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,200
incident before the worst happens and

359
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,480
even if I only detect it at the point

360
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,440
that they've already started

361
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,360
compromising and stealing my data

362
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,519
potentially I still have time before the

363
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,500
ransom hits which is even worse I mean

364
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,300
it's bad enough to have data theft but

365
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,560
it's even worse when they encrypt it

366
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,680
afterwards so that's that's interesting

367
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,000
and you know there's stats there at the

368
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,260
bottom that kind of give you some more

369
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,480
details across different types of

370
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,200
organizations and clearly there's some

371
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,240
size differences ransomware differences

372
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,500
all this kind of thing but uh the

373
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,399
you know

374
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,440
the variability I think is somewhat

375
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,480
predictable unfortunately schools and

376
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,760
educational institutions seem to be

377
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,800
infected for the longest uh periods of

378
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,160
time and often with multiple attackers

379
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,560
which is a a whole separate problem

380
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,300
where you may have something like

381
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,639
cryptoware or crypto ransomware crypto

382
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:32,700
mining for a month and then afterwards

383
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,500
another criminal comes in using the same

384
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,200
vulnerability and causes a a layered

385
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,779
attack if you want to call it that

386
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,820
small businesses struggle with this and

387
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,680
it it's interesting that it's almost

388
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,380
directly proportional to size and

389
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,959
there's two reasons for this uh in our

390
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,000
experience the under 500 person

391
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
companies do not have full-time security

392
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,180
staff that is empowered to be

393
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,980
spending time threat hunting right

394
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,079
they're so small that they're spending

395
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:03,360
all of their time trying to fight fires

396
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,700
and there's no proactive activity

397
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,500
occurring and then those victims to

398
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,600
allow them to detect that they've been

399
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,480
compromised the bigger companies do have

400
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,399
full-time security staff so that

401
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,060
certainly uh slows or speeds up their

402
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,160
detection times but even more than that

403
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,180
the criminals may send out an email spam

404
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,399
with a malicious attachment and collect

405
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,860
100 victims well they're going to Target

406
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,740
the bigger organizations first because

407
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,560
they have more money and so they they

408
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,680
naturally go to the larger victims uh to

409
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,899
collect larger ransoms and then when

410
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:41,579
they run out of large victims they

411
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:43,320
eventually get around two or three or

412
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,420
four weeks later to then targeting those

413
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,980
smaller organizations for smaller

414
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,899
amounts of money if they don't have an

415
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:51,540
influx of new victims so there's a few

416
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,519
different explanations but

417
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,560
um to me this was quite expected that

418
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,660
small companies struggle with detection

419
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:01,699
times much more than large organizations

420
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,040
so why is this dwell time you know so

421
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,620
high and so variable and I think one of

422
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,899
the big reasons is uh what are now being

423
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:12,480
referred to as initial access Brokers

424
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,740
and if you're not familiar with that

425
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,540
terminology in essence what it is is

426
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,459
there's a whole group of criminal

427
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,380
Specialists these days that specialize

428
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,360
in just getting

429
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,220
their foot in the door whether that's

430
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,899
the malicious attachment to get a bot

431
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:27,300
onto a computer whether it's phishing

432
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,519
credentials whatever it is once they

433
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,040
have that they then sell that access

434
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,600
onto other criminals to the highest

435
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,420
bidder and they may get more money for a

436
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,120
victim in country X versus country why

437
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,639
they may get more money for a company

438
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,620
with 5 000 employees instead of one

439
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,199
thousand employees perhaps if they have

440
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:47,760
administrative access they get more

441
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,260
money for that victim than one without

442
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,540
administrative access but there's entire

443
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,760
forums out there dedicated to selling

444
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,220
access to other criminals to take

445
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,899
advantage of access that's been gained

446
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:00,480
and this is a screenshot from a portal

447
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,459
that just went offline not very long ago

448
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:04,199
but is no longer available but it was

449
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:07,620
called uas RDP shop they specialized in

450
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,680
selling remote desktop protocol access

451
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,480
to victims all over the world you can

452
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,579
see an example on the right hand side of

453
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:16,860
the screen listing all the critical

454
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,320
things you need to know about a company

455
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,880
you might want to buy access to which

456
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,000
country they're in if they have a postal

457
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,440
code that might indicate their region

458
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,940
they tell you that what operating system

459
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,800
how much memory how much bandwidth up

460
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,839
how much bandwidth down

461
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:33,120
um does can you get directly to it via

462
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,800
its IP is it like directly on the open

463
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,420
internet or do I have to come in through

464
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,100
some sort of proxy to get administrative

465
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,740
rights uh or does it have admin rights

466
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,360
or is it just a non-privileged user and

467
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,860
you can see the prices are variable by

468
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,019
the countries I think the most expensive

469
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:47,579
one you see here on the screen is Hong

470
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:50,160
Kong for 19 for a machine that has admin

471
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,040
access in Hong Kong whereas other ones

472
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,899
which don't have admin access are a

473
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:56,579
little cheaper and it all depends on the

474
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:59,040
country that the victim might be in and

475
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,540
of course these types of services are

476
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,980
available to sell

477
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,220
access not just to RDP but to secure

478
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,959
shell on Linux machines and Unix

479
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,199
machines uh and and lots of other uh

480
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:12,959
remote access products uh log me in

481
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,240
TeamViewer VNC all these types of things

482
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,919
and so I think this is one of the

483
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:18,720
reasons we see such a high dwell time

484
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,780
sometimes these initial access Brokers

485
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,699
will send out thousands and tens of

486
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:24,959
thousands and millions of phishing

487
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,119
emails and they may net several hundred

488
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,040
or thousand victims that fall for their

489
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,140
attack and they put them up in these

490
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,940
stores and then depending on what

491
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,919
country that victim's in or how wealthy

492
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,500
that company may be they're going to be

493
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,960
on the shelf for purchase for different

494
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,780
amounts of time and that certainly

495
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,520
contributes to some of that variability

496
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,160
and long dwell times that we see where

497
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,140
no malware has really been deployed

498
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,460
necessarily on the victim's Network

499
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,720
they're just sitting on the shelf

500
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,460
waiting for a criminal to purchase them

501
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,860
legitimate and tools also increase some

502
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,179
of the stealthiness I think this is

503
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,559
another reason smaller organizations

504
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,539
really struggle with detection this

505
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:05,400
isn't about detecting malware so much

506
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,080
anymore because so much of what we

507
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,960
detect is legitimate uh if you look at

508
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,840
this list from the report uh you know

509
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,220
Powershell like who doesn't have

510
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,660
Powershell on their Network I mean it's

511
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,039
almost impossible to administrate

512
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,100
Windows without writing some Powershell

513
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,140
and malicious scripts is everything not

514
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,320
Powershell but that's largely uh

515
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,780
traditional uh scripts Python scripts

516
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,640
javascripts you know this kind of stuff

517
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,700
Microsoft PS exec Cobalt strike you know

518
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,039
legitimate pen testing tool then we get

519
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,660
into stuff that's a little more dicey

520
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,820
like hopefully your security products

521
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,260
should be trying to detect things like

522
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,120
web shells but then you have like

523
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,460
legitimate Microsoft tools like net uh

524
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,919
net.exe so

525
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:49,080
um you know Mimi cats clearly you know

526
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,720
again malicious software tools or

527
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,340
security tools should detect malicious

528
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,799
software like MiMi cats but the vast

529
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,720
majority of this is not something that

530
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,100
your antivirus is going to alert on

531
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,539
right you need to have a different

532
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,580
approach to application control you need

533
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,500
to have a different approach to how you

534
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,780
uh think about

535
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,000
um whether these legitimate tools when

536
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,100
they're in use should be in use right

537
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,380
like I don't think the average end users

538
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,679
should have net.exe probably being

539
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:18,120
executed in a shell on their machine

540
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,740
like most people are going to know what

541
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,799
that is why is the woman in accounting

542
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,500
or the the man in tech support running

543
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,980
that tool and there's indicators when it

544
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,840
it's appropriate when it's not but this

545
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,820
is not the old days of antivirus saying

546
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,020
this thing is good and this thing is bad

547
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,000
well these things are good and bad right

548
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,220
like one of the first things a lot of

549
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,080
times we see in an incident is the

550
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,760
criminal runs who am I when they

551
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,500
compromise a computer they literally

552
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,000
don't know what account they might have

553
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,559
compromised when they exploit a

554
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,840
vulnerability in your web server and

555
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,160
they need to know who they are well no

556
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,780
legitimate person doesn't know who they

557
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,700
are it has to ask the computer like who

558
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,440
am I I mean that's a pretty big

559
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,940
indicator that something terrible is

560
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,559
going on but if you're not watching for

561
00:19:58,559 --> 00:19:59,640
it

562
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,440
um it'll go unnoticed and it's a

563
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,580
legitimate tool right it's part of

564
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,559
windows

565
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:09,059
other indicators from our study uh 73 of

566
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:10,440
these incidents involved ransomware

567
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,480
right so I mean literally three quarters

568
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,760
of the things the the attacks that are

569
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,260
large enough that somebody has to reach

570
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,059
out and ask for help from a group of

571
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:20,280
professionals three out of four times

572
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,980
it's ransomware and once they get into

573
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,679
your network 82 percent of the time they

574
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,600
hop from computer to computer using RDP

575
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,000
and this this is a really tough problem

576
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,740
to solve right so most of us are

577
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,780
listening and stopped exposing RDP to

578
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,000
the open internet uh this year's

579
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,500
research showed it it was down to one

580
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,179
percent so of the cases that we

581
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:41,520
demonstrated almost none of them started

582
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,919
with RDP from the outside but once the

583
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,559
criminals got a foothold on the inside

584
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:48,600
it was all RDP in the vast majority four

585
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,120
out of five cases uh and the problem is

586
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,860
like you could disable the RDP service

587
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,260
you could turn it off but the criminals

588
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,520
once they have administrative rights

589
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,900
they just turn it back on because it's

590
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,120
really convenient and they'll just issue

591
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,400
a GPO and tell windows turn RDP on

592
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,600
everywhere on the network or at least

593
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,640
maybe turn RDP on on all the servers

594
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,039
anyway because those servers are where

595
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,360
all the the data is that they're

596
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,760
interested in stealing and encrypting so

597
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,679
that trend is continued and it's a

598
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,120
really hard Trend to combat because we

599
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,559
have seen the criminals and networks

600
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,600
where it's been disabled just go oh they

601
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,980
turned it off I guess I have to turn it

602
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,679
back on and they do uh

603
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:24,360
if we look at dwell time again though

604
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,340
you can kind of sort the top and bottom

605
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,020
of that chart so the top of that chart

606
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,419
is stuff that you implant so that you

607
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,340
can come back later sort of a back door

608
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,679
a way to get in very common amongst

609
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:36,360
these initial access Brokers I need a

610
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,220
way to get back onto this network so I

611
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,380
can sell this victim screen connect any

612
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,840
desk Cobalt strike web shells this kind

613
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,000
of stuff the small bars at the bottom of

614
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,559
the chart the bottom say two-thirds of

615
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,140
the chart or so those are things that

616
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,000
you're doing while you're hacking the

617
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,100
network right like I'm now got a human

618
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,380
with hands on the keyboard and I'm in

619
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,120
the middle of hacking you I'm modifying

620
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,860
the registry to turn things on and off

621
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,780
I'm running malicious scripts I'm

622
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,340
turning off your antivirus or your

623
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,320
endpoint security I'm creating new

624
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,299
administrative accounts right I'm

625
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:08,220
scheduling tasks to say run the

626
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,200
ransomware in three days at midnight

627
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,179
when everybody's gone home for the

628
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:15,480
weekend that type of activity so the the

629
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,280
ones that we can watch for to be an

630
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,960
indicator earlier in the compromise

631
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,659
before the attackers are actively trying

632
00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:24,539
to compromise and steal our data is that

633
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:26,820
first set of things remote access tools

634
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,940
pen testing tools web shells those are

635
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,380
the things that are persistent that we

636
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,419
have time to detect before the bad stuff

637
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,720
happens

638
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,539
this was fascinating to me my colleague

639
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:43,980
John Shire uh did an analysis of the

640
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,440
date that

641
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,340
the customer was compromised compared to

642
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,500
the date that these vulnerabilities were

643
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,960
publicly disclosed with a proof of

644
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,600
concept so whether that was a Metasploit

645
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,000
module or somebody publishing a proof of

646
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,159
concept on GitHub or Twitter

647
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,400
and it's it's not a coincidence that the

648
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,500
vast majority of victims are compromised

649
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,900
literally the day of or within the next

650
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,580
two or three days so if you look at that

651
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,980
first vulnerability Citrix it was

652
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,740
commonly called the Citrix vulnerability

653
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,480
at the time somebody not liking the

654
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,260
company Citrix uh the day one days are

655
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,700
day Zero if you will of the proof of

656
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,679
concept coming out huge number of

657
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,260
victims and then it tails off over the

658
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:32,340
next couple days uh as time passes and

659
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,340
the same is true with proxy logon proxy

660
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,320
shell

661
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,760
whenever they get publicity and we're

662
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,080
all talking about them suddenly the

663
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,640
criminals are out there scanning for any

664
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,440
computer on the internet that may have

665
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,679
been vulnerable and this is really a

666
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:51,000
challenge for especially for servers VPN

667
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,760
concentrators firewalls things that most

668
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,500
of us are uncomfortable patching day

669
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,900
zero day one like very few people with

670
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,840
patched exchange servers within uh even

671
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,760
a week of Patch Tuesday and for good

672
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,799
reason I mean exchange is really easy to

673
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,140
mess it up and people your fellow

674
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,520
co-workers know when you break email

675
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,039
like you're nobody wants to break email

676
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:13,620
and it might be prudent to wait a week

677
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,900
two weeks to test patching your exchange

678
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,760
service before you do it problem is if

679
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,220
they're compromising you within 24 to 72

680
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,299
hours

681
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:23,220
you're already compromised with the web

682
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,240
shell before you patch so you need to

683
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,159
not just patch you actually need to go

684
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:30,600
back when you know when it's a known

685
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,520
exploited vulnerability you need to go

686
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,080
back and look for evidence that you

687
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,880
might have been compromised during the

688
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,280
window before you patched and and I'm

689
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,720
not going to argue that you should patch

690
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,460
your exchange servers the same day fixes

691
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,320
come out because it's almost impossible

692
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,000
right like most of us are not able to do

693
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,740
that and it may not even be safe to do

694
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,539
it not all the patches are perfect

695
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:51,059
but we do need to be very careful about

696
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:52,860
applying mitigations immediately if

697
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,440
Microsoft says turn the web access off

698
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,320
or put it behind a zero trust or put it

699
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,140
behind a VPN or we should be applying

700
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,820
those mitigations immediately even if we

701
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,200
can't apply the patches immediately

702
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,080
because these most these infections are

703
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,240
occurring almost immediately once proof

704
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,240
of concepts are published and uh most of

705
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,679
us are patching after those proof of

706
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,240
Concepts so we have to figure out a way

707
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,320
to kind of bridge that Gap

708
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,120
uh lastly exfiltration right I mean the

709
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,400
criminals don't just encrypt files these

710
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,220
days uh they steal them as well to use

711
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,620
it as an extortion tactic we're all

712
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,179
actually getting pretty good at backups

713
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:31,679
more and more customers in all of our

714
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,600
surveys when we look at victims have

715
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,220
backups and are able to use those

716
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,440
backups to recover from a ransomware

717
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,299
attack so the Hedge against that for the

718
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:40,880
criminals of course is exfiltration

719
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,260
they're using active directory to look

720
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,900
for file shares specifically that have

721
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,179
Finance HR it budget information

722
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:51,539
password lists uh and legal documents

723
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:53,400
these are the most lucrative things that

724
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,200
they can publish on the dark web to kind

725
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,179
of force you to pay

726
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:00,059
um 90 of the time in my experience

727
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,440
they're using our clones so if you're

728
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,059
not familiar a great open source tool I

729
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:04,620
use our clone for my own backup so I

730
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,520
didn't even know about it until

731
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,500
criminals started using it and it's this

732
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,120
fantastic tool that lets you do things

733
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,059
like an rsync or an x copy but the

734
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:13,740
destination could be a cloud service you

735
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,900
can say copy this directory or this

736
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,659
entire hard drive to an S3 bucket or to

737
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:21,419
the back Blaze or to in the criminals

738
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:23,580
case Mega and Google Drive seem to be

739
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,260
the preferred ones

740
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,779
um the vast majority of victims had data

741
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:29,880
stolen was copied up to Mega which is uh

742
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,039
kim.com's old file sharing service used

743
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:34,860
to be called mega.co.nz

744
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,799
um it's a a large file sharing service

745
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,480
quite famous for hosting a lot of

746
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,100
pirated content

747
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,900
um criminals seem to prefer it and they

748
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,059
use our clone to copy and steal all your

749
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:47,760
data and send it up to Mega as a storage

750
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,799
place so this is kind of good for

751
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:51,480
defenders in a small way which is if you

752
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,760
can detect these attacks in progress the

753
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,880
password for the rclone tool to log into

754
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,460
Mega is often still on your computer and

755
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,900
you can log into Mega and delete all

756
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,880
your files or recover them yourself

757
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,559
we've actually had victims log into

758
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,240
their own stolen information and

759
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,740
re-download it after it was encrypted

760
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,080
from the criminals before deleting it so

761
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,059
it's not always a lost cause not all of

762
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:13,200
these things are bad but these are

763
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,000
certainly indicators to watch for that

764
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,340
expectation is happening because

765
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,159
um in in almost all cases our clone is

766
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,400
in use and either a Google Drive Mega

767
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,980
Dropbox Etc are being used to to host

768
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:29,480
the files on behalf of the criminals

769
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,740
and there's not a lot of exclusivity in

770
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,600
this business when you go to purchase

771
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,980
those credentials from initial access

772
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,539
broker a lot of times they'll actually

773
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:38,279
mark them in the forums as to whether

774
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:40,039
they are available

775
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:42,600
uh exclusively or whether they're

776
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,159
selling that access to multiple

777
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,320
different criminals and in this case we

778
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,940
had three different ransomware groups

779
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,799
attack the same victim if you're

780
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,240
interested we wrote A Blog on it I put

781
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,620
the title there at the bottom lockbit

782
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,720
Hive and black cat attack Automotive

783
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,039
supplier and triple ransomware attack

784
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,179
but

785
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:59,039
um initially the initial access broker

786
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,440
did break in Via exposed RDP at the end

787
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,559
of 2021 and then we proceeded to see

788
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,179
three different ransomware groups log

789
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:07,799
into their systems and encrypt files

790
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:10,740
over the course of about a four-week

791
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,860
period and it got to the point where the

792
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,380
ransomwares were re-encrypting the files

793
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,140
while the previous ransomware was still

794
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,179
in the process of encrypting other files

795
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:22,500
and they were like stepping on each

796
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,760
other to where some of the files were

797
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,860
encrypted five different times between

798
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,200
the three different ransomware groups uh

799
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,299
so it got pretty insane but this is not

800
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:32,159
uncommon we were seeing more and more

801
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,380
frequently multiple attackers most often

802
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,620
we see crypto Miner installed after a

803
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,020
vulnerability like proxy logon crypto

804
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,460
Miner will be there for three months

805
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,080
then that victim will get sold to a

806
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,520
ransomware actor who will then encrypt

807
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,860
it so that's the most common but there's

808
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,659
been multiple cases in the last year

809
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:50,580
where we've seen at least two and

810
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,020
sometimes three different ransomware

811
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,400
groups in the same network at the same

812
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,640
time

813
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:58,740
so what do we do right defense is what I

814
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,179
promised in the title how we're going to

815
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:03,200
build a defensive playbook

816
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,539
so analyzing all the mistakes that we

817
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:07,559
made in the first half of the

818
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:09,659
presentation we can kind of take a look

819
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:11,340
at what are the what are the most

820
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,840
effective things we're going to do to

821
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,960
try not to be one of these victims

822
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,059
I joke around that there are ransomware

823
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:20,520
uh or our rapid response Services where

824
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,740
all this data comes from and and I I

825
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,779
joke that you know this talk is really

826
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:27,179
about how not to become a customer of

827
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:29,279
our rapid response service if you can

828
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,080
learn why other people ended up being

829
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,820
customers then hopefully we can take

830
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,100
actions to not be a customer

831
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,799
and I mean patching is obvious but we

832
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,179
all know it's a heck of a lot harder

833
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:42,299
than it sounds and when we look at the

834
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:44,520
vulnerabilities that were exploited in

835
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,919
2021 and this has not changed in 2022

836
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:49,799
the vast majority are proxy logon proxy

837
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:53,100
shell uh Fortinet VPN pulse secure VPN

838
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,220
Cisco and Citrix vulnerabilities stuff

839
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,779
that's been out for a year two years

840
00:29:57,779 --> 00:30:00,480
some of it three years now and still

841
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,299
unpatched and so we kind of have to look

842
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:05,580
like it's important but we know you

843
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,960
can't patch everything so how do you

844
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,419
decide which things you need to be

845
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:10,559
patching

846
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,899
versus which things can wait when you

847
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:14,460
don't have enough staff or time to test

848
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:17,580
all the patches and my kind of key

849
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,899
points are here in the slide if you're

850
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:20,399
not familiar with cisa it's part of the

851
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:21,659
United States Department of Homeland

852
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:24,179
Security they publish a known exploited

853
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:25,500
vulnerabilities list for the US

854
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,940
government to understand which

855
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,740
vulnerabilities to prioritize and I

856
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,840
highly recommend following that that

857
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,159
gives you a list of things that are

858
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,899
known to be used by criminals to be

859
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:36,600
actively targeting people there are tens

860
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,919
of thousands of vulnerabilities

861
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,720
disclosed every year but there's only

862
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,120
like a hundred that are actually

863
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,159
actively attacked by criminals so you

864
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,600
need to focus your attention there don't

865
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,159
worry about all twenty thousand worry

866
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:48,960
about the ones that we know somebody's

867
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,039
targeting

868
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,960
another mistake I think we make is in

869
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,820
the old days a lot of threats came in

870
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,500
through our endpoints our laptops and

871
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,940
our personal computers

872
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,980
the threats are coming in now through

873
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,659
infrastructure and servers so that they

874
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:02,100
have to be the top priority the

875
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,500
criminals golden Jewels is to get to the

876
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,840
sensitive data on those servers and

877
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,940
almost every one of the attacks in this

878
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,520
year's report that we just talked about

879
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,860
almost every single one of them when it

880
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,360
was a vulnerability it was a VPN

881
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,380
concentrator or an RDP or an unpatched

882
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:22,020
server not an endpoint very rarely an

883
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,880
endpoint so if I've only got small

884
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,340
amounts of time to patch I'm first

885
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,720
hitting the servers making sure they get

886
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,580
patched then I'm hitting the firewalls

887
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,860
the vpns all that externally facing

888
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,320
infrastructure that we're all afraid to

889
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,940
patch because we've all patched a Cisco

890
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,620
router and had our config go sideways I

891
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,659
mean it's not fun to do this stuff but

892
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:41,039
it really does have to be the priority

893
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,899
and do them you know do them in that

894
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:44,520
order you got to patch everything if you

895
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,159
can get around to it but order them so

896
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:49,740
that the most important ones start first

897
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,320
and understand that security and I.T

898
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,880
often have different goals if you're in

899
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,440
a large enough organization that has the

900
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,820
privilege of having a security team

901
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,740
that's separate from it you understand

902
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,840
that Security's job is to identify these

903
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,279
vulnerabilities and figure out which

904
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:03,779
ones are going to likely lead your

905
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:06,299
business to have a problem it's job is

906
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,980
to actually go out and deploy all those

907
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,480
patches right and they're very different

908
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,360
responsibilities if you're running in an

909
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,799
organization that hasn't has those two

910
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,080
distinct functions so try to be

911
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,880
compassionate that those I.T people not

912
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,380
have to not just patch those

913
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,940
vulnerabilities but they also have to

914
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,980
like image laptops and deploy new

915
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,440
software and services and so if as

916
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,059
security person you can help them with

917
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:29,460
the prioritization you're both going to

918
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,260
have more Mutual success

919
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,020
and not all systems are created equal

920
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,360
like sometimes it's okay if a system

921
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,220
gets compromised compared to another one

922
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,500
and when it really comes down to only

923
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,360
having 10 hours to patch in 20 hours

924
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,880
were the things to patch prioritizing

925
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,440
the ones where the most damage is going

926
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,559
to occur is is clearly a priority

927
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,520
especially if you're in a legacy

928
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,380
infrastructure

929
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,899
um where you know maybe once you're

930
00:32:54,899 --> 00:32:56,460
inside the network you have privileged

931
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,960
access which is true in most

932
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,000
organizations still and we all know that

933
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,460
we want to get away from that but these

934
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,039
things take time and prioritization is

935
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,020
critical

936
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,779
looking for what's uh inordinary right

937
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,059
like just because it's a legitimate tool

938
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:14,100
doesn't mean it should be on your

939
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,260
network and more importantly it's about

940
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,059
often it's about when it's on your

941
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:21,980
network uh if you know

942
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:25,080
you probably use most of these tools in

943
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,000
some capacity maybe not many cats maybe

944
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,740
only your red team or your penetration

945
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,659
testing company might be using something

946
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:33,000
like MiMi cats but many of us are using

947
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,039
nmap and Powershell and even our clone

948
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,659
like I said I learned about it from the

949
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:38,279
criminals like it's a great Backup Tool

950
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:40,320
I'm using it to back up my own stuff so

951
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,659
like these are common tools what we need

952
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:46,200
to look for is what standing out is

953
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,380
um inordinary and what I mean by that is

954
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:51,360
a normal person in accounting their

955
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,740
computer probably shouldn't be running

956
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,679
the angry ip scanner they probably also

957
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,980
shouldn't be running PS exec and they

958
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,840
certainly shouldn't be running Mimi cats

959
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,419
and you may use our clone but you may

960
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:06,120
use our clone on a subset of your

961
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,639
servers to consolidate your backups

962
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,639
if you see it anywhere else that's bad

963
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,500
right like you need to be able to start

964
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,379
detecting legitimate tools in the wrong

965
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:19,199
place or the wrong time because most of

966
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,000
these attacks are intentionally off

967
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,239
hours to hopefully evade detection and

968
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,980
on the assumption that maybe you do not

969
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:31,219
have a 24x7 security operation

970
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,040
look for combinations that are odd right

971
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,580
um

972
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,159
running who am I and then running a

973
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,659
Powershell script

974
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,760
is pretty weird like that's not

975
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,480
something most people are going to do uh

976
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,480
similarly uh you know Powershell will

977
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,918
often download

978
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:53,940
uh a malicious dll and then run dll 32

979
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,980
will get run immediately afterwards to

980
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,619
load that dll to start doing malicious

981
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:00,359
things it's a very common attack pattern

982
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:01,740
that criminals have used it's a very

983
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,000
common attack pattern of tools like

984
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,040
Cobalt strike and Metasploit

985
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,320
that's not something again a legitimate

986
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,359
admin doing to it a legitimate admin may

987
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:10,680
use PS exec to do some remote

988
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,339
Administration a legitimate admins very

989
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:18,060
unlikely to run run dll 32 to manually

990
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,980
load a dll into memory that's just not

991
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,020
something that happens so trying to look

992
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,640
for those combinations and one of the

993
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,380
ways you can help manage this is by

994
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,540
having your

995
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,160
a change management process so whether

996
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,900
you have your own security operations

997
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,820
center or sock or whether you're

998
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,859
Contracting with a third-party firm to

999
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:36,660
maybe do manage detection and response

1000
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,339
on your behalf

1001
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:40,680
it's much easier to do that job when you

1002
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,500
know when those admin tools are in use

1003
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,680
so if you do your changes uh to your

1004
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,240
firewalls and your infrastructure and

1005
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,500
all your patch deployment to your

1006
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,020
servers on the third Saturday of the

1007
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,420
month then the sock news on the third

1008
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,060
Saturday when they see PS exact it's

1009
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,619
probably Administration don't worry

1010
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:00,300
about it the IT team came in this

1011
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,820
Saturday to get things done whereas when

1012
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,099
they see it on the following Monday they

1013
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:07,380
know it's probably a criminal because no

1014
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,880
changes should be happening that require

1015
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,579
any of these administrative scripts

1016
00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:12,900
Powershell PS exec these things aren't

1017
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,540
being used outside of the change window

1018
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,880
when a change has been approved to be

1019
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,040
applied and while many of us hate change

1020
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,720
management I mean just it's this

1021
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,280
bureaucracy that gets in our way of

1022
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,900
doing things the way we want to be able

1023
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,359
to do them as quickly as possible if the

1024
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,359
really really helpful for detecting a

1025
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:31,920
latent compromise in your network where

1026
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,480
a legitimate tool is being used for

1027
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,880
illegitimate purposes

1028
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,780
foreign

1029
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,880
this pictures of a young woman who

1030
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,740
thinks she's hacked the airport security

1031
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,440
system which is she doesn't want to pay

1032
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,380
to check her luggage so she wore all of

1033
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,900
her clothes layered one layer after the

1034
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,400
next after the next so she wouldn't have

1035
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,560
to pay to check a bag at the airport I

1036
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,000
love all kinds of hacking it doesn't

1037
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,320
have to be computer hacking I just

1038
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,599
thought she is brilliant for not having

1039
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:03,240
to pay the 50 bag charge

1040
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,320
um but obviously when we're talking

1041
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,560
about layers in security it's not just

1042
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,180
defense in depth and we we all know

1043
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,619
about defense in depth and you know we

1044
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:11,760
should have email security we should

1045
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,660
have web security we should have

1046
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,859
endpoint security we should have this

1047
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:15,780
and we should have xdr Mission all this

1048
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,800
stuff

1049
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,859
um but what those layers do in the midst

1050
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:21,720
of an attack they may not always detect

1051
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,460
everything but they help you paint a

1052
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,619
picture of what's going on you can tell

1053
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:28,320
that very large amount of data started

1054
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,200
going out the firewall only 15 minutes

1055
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,440
after the Powershell script launched our

1056
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,900
clone and those things together are a

1057
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,119
lot more mean meaningful than they are

1058
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,400
alone so having those layers helps you

1059
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,140
paint that picture to see what's really

1060
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,180
going on in the network and if you've

1061
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,400
only got spotty um and not all those

1062
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,300
layers are always going to be present

1063
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,320
like I said you know when I'm working

1064
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,660
from home I'm not behind the sofas

1065
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,520
firewall which is doing web filtering at

1066
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,740
the office I'm behind my own access

1067
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,260
point and turns out I happen to have one

1068
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,760
at home but most of their employees

1069
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,160
don't right so the more of those layers

1070
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,140
that we have in place the more of a

1071
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,640
complete picture we can understand and

1072
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,640
they give us context as to a series of

1073
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,440
things and how they uh how they've

1074
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,480
played out and if you've done a forensic

1075
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,920
investigation you understand how

1076
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,380
important the timeline of events is when

1077
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,480
you're trying to unravel and get back to

1078
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,099
the source the root cause of your

1079
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:21,660
problems and the more of these layers

1080
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,280
even when they're not

1081
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,099
effective at blocking like not all the

1082
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:27,300
products are always going to detect

1083
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,280
everything all the time the human being

1084
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,140
when they're reviewing these things can

1085
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,480
suddenly get to a much earlier detection

1086
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,420
which leads to an earlier eviction right

1087
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,099
we want to evict the criminal from our

1088
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:40,500
Network and get them out and the sooner

1089
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,359
we detect them and evict them the less

1090
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:43,560
damage they're going to be able to cause

1091
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,200
and those layers are not just barriers

1092
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,079
they're also places of logging right we

1093
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:51,599
get we get we get clues that we can use

1094
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,160
to paint that picture for the humans to

1095
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,900
know something's wrong

1096
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,500
foreign

1097
00:38:57,859 --> 00:39:00,420
I don't think anybody needs to tell you

1098
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,000
use multi-factor authentication anymore

1099
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,980
um like we've all been told five million

1100
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,500
times uh but there are particular things

1101
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,940
to think about when you're approaching

1102
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:12,300
multi-factor authentication uh clearly

1103
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,099
at the top of the screen here remote

1104
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:16,560
access is the number one place you have

1105
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,900
to start as of the time of this

1106
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,880
recording there was a recent Uber breach

1107
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,500
and there's been many other in the last

1108
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,099
few weeks and those almost all started

1109
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:29,160
with some sort of credential breach and

1110
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,839
even when multi-factor is there which

1111
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:32,339
it's alleged to have been there in the

1112
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:34,859
particular attack against Uber it's not

1113
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:36,839
always perfect but start with the remote

1114
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:39,420
access tools absolutely have to require

1115
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,520
it because this is more often than not

1116
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,599
where the criminals are coming in

1117
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:44,579
whether it's attacking the VPN server or

1118
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:46,440
RDP itself or tool through tools like

1119
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,880
caseya

1120
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,800
give your employees password managers

1121
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,780
like telling them to have unique

1122
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:55,380
passwords on 35 different websites isn't

1123
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,300
working like clearly no human being is

1124
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,160
going to do that properly give them the

1125
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,960
tools they need to have half a chance to

1126
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,880
get it done even if it's free ones you

1127
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,140
don't have to spend any money give them

1128
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,700
key pass give them the free version of

1129
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,280
bit Warden do something to enable them

1130
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,619
to do the right thing and even if it's

1131
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:12,240
not all of them if some of them start

1132
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,380
doing the right thing you're still

1133
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,920
better off them then when they're not

1134
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,060
multi-factor obviously there's sort of a

1135
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,520
stack ranking of how effective they can

1136
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,200
be the cheapest and easiest thing to do

1137
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,420
is those time-based tokens the six

1138
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,280
digits like you see on the RSA key

1139
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,960
they're called toppy

1140
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,119
you know that's better than nothing and

1141
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:31,680
unfortunately those are very easy to

1142
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,359
fish so they're kind of easy for

1143
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,760
criminals to bypass these days uh the

1144
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,260
next step up from there may be a

1145
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,280
commercial tool that does push

1146
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,920
notifications to your phone uh most of

1147
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,300
us have experienced that with Apple and

1148
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,579
Google devices where you go to log into

1149
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:46,200
your Apple account it pushes a thing to

1150
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,520
your iPhone says press this button is

1151
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,260
that you logging in commercially of

1152
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,480
course we use tools like Duo from Cisco

1153
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,060
that enable push notification it's

1154
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,280
another step better than just asking me

1155
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,740
for six digits ideally for your really

1156
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,480
sensitive stuff people with access maybe

1157
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,940
to your source code access to your

1158
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,280
customer information you really need to

1159
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,420
start thinking about Hardware tokens

1160
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,859
like a UB key in the picture there

1161
00:41:07,859 --> 00:41:10,560
ideally

1162
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,119
um that's going to determine what kind

1163
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:13,500
of access you get to the network the

1164
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,760
super sensitive things need Hardware

1165
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,920
tokens the moderately sensitive things

1166
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,720
maybe use an app on your phone and

1167
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,460
things that are less less important may

1168
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,140
have no multi-factor at all or maybe

1169
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,119
just the six digit codes that kind of

1170
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:25,859
thing what we're starting to see now

1171
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:28,260
unfortunately is Cookie theft bypassing

1172
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,599
multi-factor altogether so more and more

1173
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:32,400
groups are using information stealing

1174
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,079
Trojans to steal the cookies from your

1175
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,880
browser and if they can steal your

1176
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,040
Office 365 cookie they don't need to use

1177
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,380
multi-factor they can just log into 365

1178
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,480
as you by just using the session cookie

1179
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,520
so we're starting to publish a lot of

1180
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,200
research on that I think at the moment

1181
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,599
it's not heavily exploited but we're

1182
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:49,920
starting to see it being used more and

1183
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,440
more started by targeting YouTubers and

1184
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,240
Gamers to get access to their accounts

1185
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,619
but we're seeing more of it in the

1186
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:58,520
corporate space as well

1187
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,380
you have to be threat hunting and if you

1188
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,940
can't do it yourself talk to your

1189
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,740
managed security service provider talk

1190
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,240
to your vendors that help you buy it

1191
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,800
equipment see if they offer a service

1192
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,140
talk to your security company like us or

1193
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,820
our competitors we all offer services

1194
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,099
now somebody has to be out there looking

1195
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:16,500
when when when when you hear the noise

1196
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,720
of the window breaking that's the alert

1197
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,740
you're getting from your endpoint

1198
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,660
security product you get the alert in

1199
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:24,119
the console saying I detected agent

1200
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:27,420
Tesla Dash X Y on this computer

1201
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,820
that doesn't mean your antivirus worked

1202
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,500
and that you just get to close the

1203
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,540
incident that means you need to open an

1204
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,400
incident you need to start investigating

1205
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,920
because it's unlikely that human

1206
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,540
attacker is going to give up just

1207
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,859
because the first thing they brought

1208
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:42,900
into your network was detected they're

1209
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,400
going to keep trying more and more

1210
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,220
things until they're successful so a

1211
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:49,440
good threat hunting organizations not

1212
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,180
just proactively looking for threats

1213
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,460
they're investigating that sound of the

1214
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,140
glass breaking in the front door and

1215
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,599
going to check and see was this an

1216
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,339
incident do I need to repair the door

1217
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:01,859
did a criminal get in and the challenge

1218
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:04,500
is just like those Stormtroopers you

1219
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,640
know the criminals are dressed up like

1220
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,380
your own employee right they stole

1221
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,300
somebody's password they're logged in as

1222
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,339
a legitimate user so you really need to

1223
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,260
understand what how your network works

1224
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,240
and what your user behaviors are so you

1225
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,880
can spot which of those Stormtroopers is

1226
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,040
the one behaving oddly right you got to

1227
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,480
find the odd Stormtrooper and the only

1228
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,560
way you're going to do that is if you're

1229
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,020
patrolling like those RCMP Canadian

1230
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,520
mounties since I'm Canadian I had to

1231
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,800
include some mounties in my my images

1232
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,859
here you know those mounties are on

1233
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,660
patrol and they Patrol that Park every

1234
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:36,060
day and they know what normal things are

1235
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,920
going on there's a yoga class in the

1236
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,359
corner of the park there's a hot dog

1237
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:40,859
vendor in the other side of the park

1238
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:43,260
they understand what normal is and when

1239
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,760
you know what normal is it makes it much

1240
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,859
much easier to detect that which of

1241
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:48,599
these Stormtroopers is not like the

1242
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:50,280
other one and that's really the key to

1243
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,960
threat hunting and if you're not being

1244
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,099
proactive in threat hunting

1245
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:55,260
unfortunately you're at the mercy of

1246
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,060
your products being perfect when we know

1247
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,800
they're not and when we're facing human

1248
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,420
adversaries they're always going to find

1249
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:02,040
a way around the product so we really

1250
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,599
need to make sure that there's a human

1251
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,940
element on our threat protection side

1252
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,339
because tools alone are just that

1253
00:44:08,339 --> 00:44:10,380
they're tools that need expert humans to

1254
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,920
operate them

1255
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,380
so that concludes my presentation I hope

1256
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,240
that information was helpful to you I

1257
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,040
expect much of that advice is advice

1258
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,079
you've received before but I wanted to

1259
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,599
put it into context for you about how

1260
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:26,220
criminals are actually using these

1261
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,200
techniques in the real world because

1262
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,540
it's telling you to patch or telling

1263
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:31,859
people to have unique passwords

1264
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:33,720
everywhere is Impractical advice if we

1265
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,540
don't understand where to apply it first

1266
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,240
and how to you know get a good start

1267
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,040
that's likely to give us the best

1268
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,380
protection from this beginning and then

1269
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,119
we can progress to better and better as

1270
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,160
we continually improve which all of us

1271
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,660
are doing right security is a journey

1272
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,900
there's no end point and so I hope that

1273
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,599
data is helpful for you to improve your

1274
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:56,099
security of your organization your

1275
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:58,680
family and maybe convince your

1276
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,180
management to provide you the support

1277
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,280
you need to accomplish these goals thank

1278
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,079
you very much hack the planet
