1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,200
um so I will need to maybe do it a

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,640
little bit slower through times and

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,799
stuff like that but I'm really

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,320
interested and excited to be here so

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,280
thank you for inviting me and I will now

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,460
talk about the presentation

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,699
um while details from acting power grids

8
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,119
into packing oil pipelines so a little

9
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,760
bit about me my name is Brock Steinberg

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,580
I'm a Founder at White pointer I'm also

11
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,740
an accurate residence and vice of it by

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,440
Adventures obviously an offer sentiment

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,700
in one labs and the speaker of Dev

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,040
connectivity and many other conferences

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,200
I give my masters in algorithms in

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,239
computer science and I love doing

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,180
research from iot Linux web apps

18
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,780
whatever you name it algorithms

19
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,180
otherwise malware and much much more I'm

20
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,120
also a DJ and a party lover so make sure

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,600
you check out also my Mixcloud and with

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,660
that in mind let's start

23
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,960
so iot attacks are anywhere

24
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,780
like really really everywhere so the

25
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,939
other team malware landscape landscape

26
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:14,040
has been increased by 125 23 in

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,920
healthcare over the last year and

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,159
Scandal systems are under attack

29
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,159
um Industrial Systems hospitals really

30
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,000
really everywhere so why attackers are

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,580
targeted and focused so much heavily on

32
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,220
iot and critical infrastructures so

33
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,560
first critical systems are tend to make

34
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,020
more damage because well they are

35
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,880
critical and in that sense if you can do

36
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,520
as an attacker more damage maybe the

37
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,500
probability for the payouts for the ones

38
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,960
who are payouts and stuff like that will

39
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,040
be increasing so because the Defenders

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,979
want to protect the systems as immediate

41
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,820
as they can to remove the attacks itself

42
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,860
so the more damage can be in court and

43
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,840
the probability for the belts will be

44
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,500
probably higher that's why uh one option

45
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,919
they try to attack them it's either they

46
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,660
can protect this kind of system because

47
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,239
it's harder to really inspect inside

48
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,040
what is really happening behind the

49
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,200
scene I think even initial access to

50
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,560
organization like VPN servers routers

51
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,340
Etc and and the scale so many devices

52
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,860
have almost the same configuration in

53
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,560
this team and landscape and there have

54
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,080
been used uh extensively for deployed

55
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,800
ransomware deduce attack uh theft of

56
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,660
source code technological source code

57
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,260
and much more crypto Mining and even

58
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,879
disabled and damaging critical

59
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,360
infrastructure uh Nations that no not

60
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,940
even interesting and much more infection

61
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,200
attempts over the first half of 2021 was

62
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,640
over a billion last year hundreds of CVS

63
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,980
many many Industries are impacted and

64
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,640
targeted so with that in mind let's go

65
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,860
into our first story so our first story

66
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,959
is going to be with the Russian Ukraine

67
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:13,080
uh cyber War we're going to explore the

68
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,200
power greens we're under attack and send

69
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,959
home apt thread actors

70
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,980
so let's recall the Russia attack on

71
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,180
Ukraine the Cyber attack on

72
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,819
2022 we started this year so they were

73
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:32,099
targeting Banks most events in Golden

74
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,140
MPS internet satellites and energy

75
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,080
providers actually at every kind of

76
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,140
critical infrastructure you can name

77
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,379
probably would have been there

78
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:47,040
um including uh I voltage critical

79
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,280
substations and much much more

80
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,980
um what was targeted is actually they

81
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,799
were trying well uh in a sense in

82
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,480
retrospective we can say that try to

83
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,299
disable electricity they were trying and

84
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,340
actually succeeding disabled uh

85
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,920
satellite invert connectivity and they

86
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,540
were damaging and wiping out critical

87
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,659
infrastructure data to make recovery of

88
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,060
this critical infrastructures way way

89
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,640
slower so they're trying to do as much

90
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,880
them as as they can to make the whole

91
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,260
more efforts uh in much much slower to

92
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,720
make their own

93
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,940
efforts into different Defender efforts

94
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,639
to Ukrainian Foods much more slowing

95
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:35,100
some sense and how to try to do it so

96
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,300
um sorry

97
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,820
so they're trying to use in the story

98
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,639
too which we will deal and focus here

99
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,919
after they were trying to do a couple of

100
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,520
wipers uh malwares uh many many versions

101
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,759
of fiber males they were targeting

102
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,820
multiple various os's

103
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,280
not just Windows machines also the end

104
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,440
of Solaris and much more and they were

105
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,960
disabling also services and ingoing and

106
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,060
outgoing Communications to make the

107
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,100
recovery even stop

108
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,979
so with that in mind a bit of context

109
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:10,500
about that this apt group so this

110
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,639
storage in ipt group is a part assumed

111
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,280
to be a part of the gru which is part of

112
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,880
the uh the the Russian uh kind of uh

113
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,180
government the intelligence Forbes and

114
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,419
it it's soon to be this unit uh seven

115
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:30,800
four four five uh five and it had

116
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,720
assumed to uh to done multiple harm and

117
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,720
damage to those blackouts were uh from

118
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,960
around 2007 uh forward wounded by the

119
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,840
FBI is really really malicious threat

120
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,740
actors this is the central one apt book

121
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,120
and

122
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,840
in this uh in these current events on

123
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,979
around March and April 20 2022 around

124
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:58,020
this status this year they were

125
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,600
targeting uh banking Korean governments

126
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,060
using the caddy wiper and medic wipers

127
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,860
which are all these quite good for

128
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,560
Windows uh they were trying to also

129
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,580
attack uh the energy providers uh uh in

130
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,500
Ukraine specific energy provider in

131
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,139
order to shut down electricity uh using

132
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:19,020
again wipers for Linux and windows as

133
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,240
well the extra family and the Callaway

134
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,600
pro version too and the using also in

135
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,259
solitude to affect uh with the ICS

136
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:33,300
protocols uh specifically the IEC 104

137
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,720
um uh protocol affecting substation

138
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,000
electrical substations so we're trying

139
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,340
to make it all happen damaging critical

140
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,759
infrastructure and much much more and

141
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,039
about the cad wipers so the first

142
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,660
version of the catalypse

143
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,440
subscriber just should raise the disk it

144
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,060
does really interesting things so the

145
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,520
first he tried to where to recursively

146
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,220
iterate the directories it overrides

147
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,039
maximum of 10 megabytes

148
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,259
um and probably to make it run maybe

149
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:06,300
really faster it use the right file than

150
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,240
the Cisco with zeros and also rewrites

151
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,240
uh the partition table of MBR and GPT to

152
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,479
zeros so it will be uh really hard to

153
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:17,819
recover the drive itself the second

154
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:19,620
version which was deployed in the energy

155
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,440
provider which was used further in

156
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,460
another Windows machines uh use this uh

157
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,979
uh interesting load them so it's called

158
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:33,780
ID patch and it uh well you can see they

159
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:38,099
use also this uh patch version of uh Ida

160
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:40,800
will threatitude remote debugger which

161
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,660
is really interesting choice maybe I

162
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,860
don't know a trolling choice or

163
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,080
something like that and it used it to

164
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,039
execute the Shocker itself uh this uh we

165
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:51,720
can see that the arguments here they

166
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,900
were using like uh key and the circle

167
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,940
path so the shadow path the shortcut was

168
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:01,259
encrypted and decrypted in inside this

169
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:02,520
uh

170
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,180
um

171
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,919
uh inside this uh uh

172
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:10,979
binary and and they also added a

173
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:14,280
specific time argument for timing this

174
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,940
attack on a specific kind of uh time as

175
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,520
needed and

176
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,680
so this is like

177
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,020
up to you about the white bread Windows

178
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,759
Viper the Ring of swipers are also

179
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:29,580
interestingly using either shred or didi

180
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,159
to just wipe the the outdrives they also

181
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,500
try to disable the in-going ongoing

182
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,559
Communications and remove it like the

183
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,520
system the unit configs to make like the

184
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,219
the whole operation of re-recovering it

185
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:45,540
really hard though because you can't

186
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,760
like remote connecting to the machine

187
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,160
and try to move the malware you need to

188
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,660
really physically connect to it because

189
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,120
they were removing all the outgoing

190
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,880
medication before doing the wiping

191
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,720
itself and these are about wipers now

192
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,180
about the story itself so the installer

193
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,019
the

194
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:07,200
the timeline of it we start with again

195
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,860
the Russia invades Ukraine uh around the

196
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,040
end of February uh Russia event and

197
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,140
until then it was assumed that December

198
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,240
was infiltrated and actually compromised

199
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,700
some energy facility with an high

200
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,100
voltage substations so inside that

201
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,220
facility uh the central group actually

202
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,160
already infiltrated and it's soon to be

203
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,640
waiting uh for the time to attack so on

204
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,580
the 8th of April we know that the power

205
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,279
grid attack was starting by uh some task

206
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:41,339
scheduling of the industry too there was

207
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:44,220
a task schedule to run it and affect the

208
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,680
system but uh fortunately they were

209
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,260
protecting it and remove uh removed the

210
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,240
thread immediately on the 12th the

211
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,040
Ukraine said announced that there was

212
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,339
the attack on the 13 actually the us

213
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:59,580
along with the FBI understand stuff and

214
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,440
now it's also what they do they were

215
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,160
found a new ICS malware new iot called

216
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,760
by dream that was uh much more generic

217
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,720
and also targeting uh many more kind of

218
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,360
devices maybe it was the future brand

219
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,339
maybe they didn't really affect it we

220
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:19,800
don't know any uh samples of it in the

221
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,560
wild really really uh as far as as we

222
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,680
know uh that we're trying to affect uh

223
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,019
specific uh kind of um

224
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:30,300
uh machines

225
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,839
and you're trying to use it afterwards

226
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:36,360
and we don't know uh so before we dive

227
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,339
in about how the industry too the the

228
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:40,620
second version of the industrator trying

229
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,380
to uh damage the electricity the

230
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,120
electricity the power stations in

231
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,120
Ukraine let's recall being Destroyer one

232
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,440
so in the story one uh is well

233
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,459
is responsible soon to be responsible in

234
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:58,320
2016 for the blackout for around an hour

235
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,860
in part of the Ukraine capital

236
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,200
and uh it has this unique ability to

237
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,459
speak the iot protocols of IEC 104 I see

238
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,820
one on one and also bcoa and stuff like

239
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,160
that it's really really interesting

240
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,740
about the factors that really raised the

241
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,240
bar and resets the uh the damage vector

242
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,339
and impact the blast radius can be done

243
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:25,260
with these kind of things it actually

244
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,240
directly controls switches and circuit

245
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,640
breakers and protection relays and one

246
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,920
of the most exciting well

247
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,640
well depend on which side of the map of

248
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,019
course but like one of the most

249
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:38,839
interesting I might say about

250
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:41,760
understanding about this uh attack would

251
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,000
be that it was actually using uh those

252
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,120
Pockets uh to make this system

253
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,540
unavailable so it was dosing the Siemens

254
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,899
uh protection relays uh to make them

255
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,959
shut down so whenever the the turn on

256
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,540
button will be switched uh there will

257
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,880
probably be some damage occurred because

258
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,399
there were no protection relays they

259
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:08,160
were trying to do uh this uh really

260
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,019
really hard damage into this machine

261
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:11,880
they were actually using this in a day

262
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,700
in there as assumed to be by the cell

263
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,519
wall group so we can see on the left

264
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,860
picture actually this device after uh

265
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,880
being then dosed this is the C protector

266
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,899
Siemens device and this is the industry

267
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:28,980
one

268
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,220
and uh going a little bit more on the

269
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,339
eye level side uh on the electric

270
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:39,839
results uh one-on-one uh we can see uh

271
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,019
some intro about it and understand how

272
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:45,839
they try to do it so how did the

273
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,940
electric uh the electricity grids and

274
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,980
way of operation communication working

275
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,320
is that usually there are scatter

276
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,600
clients so on the first point you can

277
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,700
see the scanner clients The Scholar

278
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,339
stations monitoring uh the rtus they

279
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:01,620
have to use are usually connected to the

280
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,600
substations themselves

281
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,720
any specific salvation uh probably have

282
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,540
its own kind of rtus the remoter in the

283
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,899
units and these units are connected to

284
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:16,200
the scada clients using a router so why

285
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,240
they use the router because many times

286
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,639
these color clients actually can

287
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,220
communicate over a TCP and of course

288
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,459
that like iot devices these iot devices

289
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:29,100
are not communicated with PCP they're

290
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,940
communicating with IEC 101 so they use

291
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,779
this extension called IEC 104 using the

292
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:40,200
aec router on the second Point here to

293
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,459
convert TCP communication into this

294
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:46,380
ic1r4 communication and therefore the

295
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,019
scada can communicate with the anti-use

296
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:50,399
so

297
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,380
in respect to being destroyed they were

298
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,079
sitting on all in the scada areas and

299
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:57,120
they could actually control directly the

300
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,120
rtus so they tried to do both uh to

301
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,880
communicate with the uh with the rtus on

302
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,040
the first install on the second soil

303
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,160
they were just uh as we know using their

304
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,279
uh this cutter with IEC 104 which is

305
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,700
this TCP extension of a ic1 not everyone

306
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,839
okay so this was the main like the main

307
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,440
core of the uh the how to use uh ic104

308
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,040
on one and one protocols but on a higher

309
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,700
level uh by the amazing paper by drivers

310
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,459
crash override we can see that there are

311
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:34,139
many ways to communicate with these

312
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,540
substations the scada clients can

313
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,519
actually control multiple kind of

314
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:41,459
devices plcs uh

315
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,920
um rtus and rpus with different kind of

316
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,180
protocols

317
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,339
the engineering work position is usually

318
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:51,420
used to control with over tcpap uh the

319
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:55,139
the the slave ought to use and we but

320
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:56,720
there are also other possibilities

321
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,699
attackers can use to uh attack us not

322
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,800
just attackers of course also engineers

323
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,199
and and the main controls of these

324
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,899
systems so the obviously servers and one

325
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:10,620
way to control the plcs and the HMI uh

326
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,839
which is the monitoring and wondering

327
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,360
infrastructure that can be used as well

328
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,019
um to control the rtus of the IEC 101

329
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,279
protocol

330
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,959
so this is the basic about the electric

331
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:25,440
grids Proto operation this is our

332
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,000
Network kind of templated network for a

333
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,760
station from Electrical uh with the

334
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,699
station facility maybe would look like

335
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:38,699
and with that in mind uh let's look

336
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:41,040
about their intent so instead of first

337
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,240
attempt the first one on 2016 was

338
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,300
assumed to be uh the following so we

339
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,920
were trying to de-energize the power

340
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,199
lines a name they were trying to deny

341
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:54,180
operate investigating control in

342
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,560
delivering the star version we're

343
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,060
actually wiping out the Outer Drive

344
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,680
wiping out computers to make them

345
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,540
unavailable to communicate with uh with

346
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,579
the devices afterwards there were

347
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:08,459
disabled protection relays and they were

348
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:11,399
waiting so whatever by they were waiting

349
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,320
so they were waiting for the operators

350
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,139
to turn on the device because now they

351
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:17,820
want they have the protection organized

352
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,660
to help them whenever there is shortages

353
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,500
or high voltage scenarios so whenever

354
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,300
the operators will manually join all the

355
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,699
electricity without the protection less

356
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:32,760
physical leverage would be would be done

357
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,560
and that's where the original attended

358
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,300
the first one probably in the second one

359
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,519
as well they want to damage efficiently

360
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:41,339
and effectively these lines to make them

361
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:44,160
disabled for uh for the longest period

362
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,639
they could they go down and get the

363
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,860
second version this is the the recent

364
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,500
one publishing

365
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,120
found out and Publishing module in the

366
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,899
every lab and this year uh and these two

367
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:01,800
samples it was task scheduled for April

368
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,640
and 8th on on the afternoon and this ad

369
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,699
is also interesting debug logs and one

370
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:10,199
cool thing we can see here on the right

371
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:12,179
you can see the the test scheduling this

372
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:14,579
camera the XML we can see that

373
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,980
interestingly bundles and no privilege

374
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,859
was required actually because they were

375
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:20,640
just send

376
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,619
TCP packets over the IEC 104 protocol so

377
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,480
they didn't have any other privilege or

378
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,280
any interesting kind of stuff you can

379
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,140
see here that the Run level is also

380
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,820
least privileged so it's really

381
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,320
interesting to see that the attackers

382
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,020
were really focusing specifically over

383
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:41,340
uh over this uh uh effect and damage for

384
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,580
the substations uh these two samples and

385
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,620
overall samples which I've got to around

386
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,740
11 uh substation trying to effect and

387
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,720
manipulate them they were knowing

388
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,480
beforehand you can see here on the left

389
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,179
screen the pickup itself sending the

390
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:58,620
data elements right we can see the

391
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,539
packets themselves they were knowing

392
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:03,419
beforehand specifically the IP addresses

393
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:07,140
the IDS use the iOS which are the

394
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,480
addresses the physical addresses and the

395
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,760
current properties of the the fields

396
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,919
they needed and they knew what they want

397
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,340
to do then it was a a range and

398
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,320
sophisticated attack was started in

399
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,780
specific ranges between and off the

400
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,299
specific switches they wanted not all of

401
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:27,059
not all on they were targeting it

402
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:30,360
specifically we can see it also here so

403
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,299
for each for example in first sample we

404
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:36,720
can see uh for each substation uh they

405
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,380
know the the IP address the iuis the

406
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,419
artists that were targeting and what

407
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:44,460
they wouldn't want uh to do with this

408
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,600
iois and again they were manipulating

409
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,960
the system also using uh the candy

410
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,360
wipers the the wipers themselves so

411
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,059
they're we're doing like this movement

412
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:59,580
all together parallel of wiping all the

413
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,640
hard drives and uh and affecting the

414
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,559
substation so it would be really hard to

415
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,480
recover these systems and the Damage

416
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,820
will be permanent as they can

417
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,760
uh that's that's really astonishing this

418
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,140
really uh intense uh um amazing stuff

419
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,539
and also interesting non-tributable dtps

420
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:21,059
for this attack is that uh they were

421
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,740
trying to use some new sophisticated

422
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:27,900
ways uh to manipulate systems so uh they

423
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,900
were using numeration of that males gpos

424
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,539
but hidden inside without having

425
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,440
privilege uh using some uh

426
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,780
interesting method with idsi adapters in

427
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,299
Powershell they were scheduling attacks

428
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:45,480
without that schedulers in I think the

429
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,419
new version of the caddy wiper uh which

430
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:49,980
is really interesting probably kind of a

431
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,020
timeout or something like that although

432
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,059
add the the prepare that passwords and

433
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,400
the iot addresses the initial compromise

434
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,380
actually is not uh really uh widely

435
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,980
known as far as we know and for this

436
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,740
time but soon to be the new they knew

437
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,160
that that the the attack Vector itself

438
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,440
the new uh they had these prepare

439
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,059
passwords

440
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:17,280
um they they were in the system for for

441
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,799
many many times before that so they knew

442
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:22,500
all all the details they they really did

443
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,500
uh intelligence over the systems before

444
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,620
uh using and attacking now uh that's

445
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,960
really really inspection they did this

446
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,380
interesting no mimikats technique to do

447
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,559
uh credential dumping they were using uh

448
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:41,640
these else dumped with a mini dump uh uh

449
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,919
like kind of uh we similar to the crash

450
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,200
down kind of uh thing when when

451
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,179
something's probably kind of crashing

452
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:50,400
but using kind of different kind of DNL

453
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,660
dlls as we see uh as we assume here

454
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,660
um so this is interesting way to dump

455
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,000
the credential and with that in mind we

456
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,580
go to the second story so this was about

457
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,100
the history of the industry to amazing

458
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,179
attacks so many interesting ttps said

459
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:11,100
was planned to Be an Effective but a

460
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,620
function Unfortunately they didn't go

461
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,740
out as planned so uh it was uh

462
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,900
fortunately Griffin but attack was

463
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,940
really really uh threatening in pristine

464
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,940
the second is about the health system in

465
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,320
Iran so the health systems in England

466
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,980
is comprised of uh composed of of the

467
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,220
the public health system the HSC the HSE

468
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,360
is the main uh the main Services of of

469
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,120
the the public health system in in

470
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,880
England it has more than 35 hospitals in

471
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,659
Iran around 70k employees

472
00:21:47,659 --> 00:21:51,419
and it was attacked it was attacked uh

473
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:54,000
really really bad by the continents last

474
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,020
year

475
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,299
so the eye level attack story starts

476
00:21:57,299 --> 00:22:01,260
with what as you know it uh or or might

477
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,400
not but

478
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,280
as many of the attacks are with fishing

479
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,520
uh they were sending Excel to some

480
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,960
employee the employee opened with

481
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,580
spreadsheet this fishing spreadsheet

482
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,860
that gave the attacker to ability to

483
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,620
connect and control the the first uh the

484
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:20,280
first the patient zero the first system

485
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,080
and to give access to the system

486
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,840
probably with a macro or some problem

487
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,080
one day I would uh I would estimate and

488
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,400
soon it was just a macro or something

489
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,700
like that was triggered but probably it

490
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,539
could be one day as well and from there

491
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:38,580
on there were later moving in the

492
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:42,179
networks using uh known passwords leaked

493
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:45,120
passwords uh using one day and and much

494
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,100
much more and eventually deploying the

495
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,320
ones who are inside the system uh they

496
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,900
were doing a lot of noise and it's

497
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,460
really interesting to see how this stack

498
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:58,860
actually evolved so 19 19th of May uh

499
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,080
2021

500
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,080
um the CEO of HC says

501
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,960
we know the attack was happening we

502
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,360
don't know what data has been taken but

503
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,020
we know some that that was compromised

504
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:16,020
and we won't pay and this is like really

505
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,539
really kind of uh not such a good way to

506
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:21,000
to deal with it with that openly in the

507
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,500
sense because they didn't tell you

508
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,900
really nothing they just say they won't

509
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,240
pay anything and they try to recover it

510
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,600
by uh themselves

511
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,320
and so regarding the timeline uh one

512
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,900
interesting thing to notice in the

513
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,900
timeline is well first there were the

514
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,000
attackers were in the network inside of

515
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,860
the networks eight week eight weeks

516
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,520
before uh really uh doing the ransomware

517
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,460
really uh getting to know out of the uh

518
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,520
getting identified eight weeks in the

519
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,380
system until the real deduction happened

520
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,559
and the real removal happened

521
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,220
um and this is the the story itself so

522
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:06,720
on 18th of uh March uh efficient email

523
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,559
is clicked and the HSC employee thinks

524
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,240
this Excel and the organization is

525
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,440
infiltrated

526
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,080
on the end of match you can see that the

527
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,900
timer here so they were around I think a

528
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,240
week or two and no one got noticed them

529
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,640
anything at all they were executing

530
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,799
cover so I can win cards like popular

531
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:29,940
stuff right so really using that the

532
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,280
antivirus well first of all let's let's

533
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,100
deal with that so antivirus they didn't

534
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,100
use does it seem to be uh modern kind of

535
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,100
videos modern kind of xtrs uh it seems

536
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,080
to be like all kind of ways of

537
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,020
protection and also it detects him but

538
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:49,320
didn't block it and why it happened is

539
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,380
because well the antivirus operated in a

540
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:57,059
monitor mode well amazing so the execute

541
00:24:57,059 --> 00:24:59,100
code so I can win cards they didn't

542
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,900
block away and then the attacker

543
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,620
continues only to the point where on the

544
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,500
mave on the May from December May began

545
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,480
that I'm in privileged probably with

546
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,880
some non-link password from that web

547
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,860
password again no one

548
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,620
again because they will not Mito mode or

549
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,419
Google attacking continues to do later

550
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:21,120
movement extract more services in other

551
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,899
hospitals sorry

552
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,799
and

553
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:29,700
also uh uh attacker execute calls like

554
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,159
at One hospital

555
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:34,679
and now the antivirus doesn't work in a

556
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:36,840
monitor mode it doesn't work in monitor

557
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,659
mode it detects the common strike and it

558
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:42,559
tries to Grant on it any fast

559
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:47,159
so we can see here that the attack uh

560
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,679
was not that sophisticated but more the

561
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,860
cyber security maturity level was really

562
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:56,880
really low so again we continue on the

563
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,520
10th uh one Hospital stock notice about

564
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,640
this corporate Striker Lads it has this

565
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,260
security provider whoever they should be

566
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,960
concerned and the antivirus providers

567
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,240
say to them well the threat was removed

568
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,120
by your systems uh the threat was moved

569
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,880
in this computer that where the alerts

570
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,440
are are called so the risk is low but it

571
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,820
doesn't mean that the virus didn't

572
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,620
spread already to another place in the

573
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:26,159
network right so they were so focused in

574
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,559
this Centric approach and didn't thought

575
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,559
about their effects widely and the risk

576
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,419
is low saying that without all the

577
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:35,159
context in relevant network is

578
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:37,039
astonishing

579
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,320
on the 11th attacker Brute Force the

580
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,260
passwords doesn't succeed uh with good

581
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,140
for their passwords first doing that

582
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,520
executes one day popular one day

583
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,679
successfully on the system and doesn't

584
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,900
get noticed at all so this is another

585
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,760
thing like

586
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,480
I I'm I'm like oh my God because no one

587
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,580
notices

588
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,919
ignored completely uh and it's really

589
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,100
really astonishing to see that uh on the

590
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,080
first thing the security provider email

591
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,500
address this talk about many other end

592
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,320
of the events since 7th of May and you

593
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,200
know what the stock team doing so the

594
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,299
soccer team is advised that there are

595
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:21,240
threats in the system and they just

596
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,240
restart the service they just restarted

597
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,400
their service team and restart the

598
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,140
service and I'm like

599
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,980
why the sorry for the language

600
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,880
um

601
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,380
in continuous on the 13th One hospital

602
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,419
again once ago actually detects attack

603
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:41,400
doing the correct thing he twisted all

604
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,740
the password using it installing the

605
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,140
house prevents the spread doing all

606
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,679
things correctly but didn't share this

607
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,600
information with all the other hospitals

608
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,980
so others because viruses still going on

609
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:59,880
and not correctly uh ir and and

610
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,460
cleansing is doing for the other uh

611
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,340
hospitals under attack

612
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:07,559
and unfortunately on the 13th the

613
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:09,779
ransomware is executed in all the

614
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:12,480
exploited hospitals altogether

615
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,580
so the answer just to recover the Run

616
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,620
survey itself so the ransomware is the

617
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,539
control somewhere the new version from

618
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:22,440
the 2021 and it encrypts fibrarily it

619
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,940
has these multi-ways of 32 threads with

620
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:29,760
Cha-Cha 8 symmetric encryption it uses

621
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,500
interesting mechanisms just really works

622
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,900
within the threads themselves uh it will

623
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,820
move backups and it also encrypts

624
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:39,240
backups uh and we can see examples here

625
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,100
for how it removes local backups uh from

626
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,220
the system from the VM backups it also

627
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,080
encrypts the main backups if there are

628
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,080
existing some backups like that and it

629
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,220
also

630
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,140
um these fashion encryption features

631
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,740
maybe to get avoid

632
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:01,020
maybe its way to avoid detection

633
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,380
um about uh but or maybe it's the way to

634
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,620
do it faster probably kind of above uh

635
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,720
it's increased parallelly with jumps uh

636
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,320
the files uh with uh one megabyte of

637
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,020
jumping in between of them uh so that's

638
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,240
a cool theme and the impact on the news

639
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,520
is really bad so this is from the from

640
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,620
the site when we were backup sites of

641
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,559
the hospitals themselves we can see many

642
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:28,799
hospitals got uh cancellations CD scan

643
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,720
cancellation MRIs 10 installation

644
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,820
appointment cancellations more than 20

645
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,100
hospitals all got affected this also

646
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,960
comments on the web people waiting for

647
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,720
for treatments for weeks and months or

648
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,059
treatments and now the Cyber attack and

649
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:43,799
again they can't get treated because

650
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:47,039
there is no opponent no no nothing it's

651
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,080
really really bad

652
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:53,580
um that's really sad story I believe

653
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,520
um so the aftermath of that more than 20

654
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,399
hospitals got impacted appointments and

655
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:02,399
ID system got shut down excellent

656
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,620
machines CD scans appointments and much

657
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,240
much more of each other because their ID

658
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,640
systems mainly of them shut down

659
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,520
interesting to say that uh maybe it

660
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,740
occurs that conscience in the middle I

661
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,899
don't know maybe they they seem they

662
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:18,960
raised really the the impact really bad

663
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,700
and they they demanded initially

664
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,039
19 million uh dollars but they gave up

665
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:28,380
and sent the keys

666
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,120
nonetheless

667
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,580
it was still hard to cover three months

668
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,419
to recover uh only by the by the end of

669
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:38,460
September the HTC recovered more than

670
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:42,059
thousand servers and and and thousand

671
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:44,580
around thousand applications themselves

672
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:48,000
really really bad attack high impact uh

673
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,100
the estimated damages without even

674
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,899
paying for the key itself without even

675
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:54,659
paying for the attackers was around 600

676
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:57,960
million dollars estimations out there uh

677
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,100
really really bad because of the

678
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,600
recovery because of the decryption

679
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,340
because you need to clean all the system

680
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,740
to check on the system because you need

681
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,600
to upgrade the system replacing them

682
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,059
they have this whole system called I

683
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:10,980
think memes means something like that

684
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,440
which is an old kind of hospital kind of

685
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,840
related systems that is really hard to

686
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,240
update so

687
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,720
uh really bad again and the cost of this

688
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,240
I have been really high uh also data

689
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,460
leaks more than 500 in general records

690
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:30,000
was published out there and yeah so this

691
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,860
was the aftermath

692
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,140
um what we can take from this attack so

693
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,480
we can definitely start this well first

694
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,820
configurable security tools there are so

695
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,740
many logo figures Securities it was not

696
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,559
updated ones more than 12 months without

697
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:46,200
any updated antivirus rules all systems

698
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,720
listening system

699
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,799
uh probably any any uh more kind of one

700
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,440
two years before and one they could have

701
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,120
worked in this system because they

702
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,399
weren't updating the attack was not that

703
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:01,980
sophisticated but more that this The

704
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,779
Defenders will not prepare they have

705
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:06,299
these low cyber security opportunity in

706
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,419
the systems you know idea ideas AV

707
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:12,419
provider effort to move uh they say yes

708
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:14,220
the risk is low and they will do not

709
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,500
feel after that they don't share the

710
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,700
information

711
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,100
they restart the servers to as a

712
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,679
protection mechanism uh really really

713
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:24,960
astonishing really bad

714
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,700
um they didn't have ways to prioritize

715
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,520
and and the standard way to to mitigate

716
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,220
and to deal with incidents so attacks

717
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,200
will happen they didn't wait to mitigate

718
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,260
them uh correctly uh communication they

719
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,659
were lacking communication uh sharing

720
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:41,279
data between the hospital even when the

721
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,899
attacking runs the record

722
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:48,539
so really bad attack misfortunate or or

723
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:51,539
also mispreparedness and music

724
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:54,840
penetration as well and many many points

725
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,120
to be taken from it and very interesting

726
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,460
bullets for you

727
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,679
uh so our last attack we're going to

728
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,179
deal with and we're going to tell about

729
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:05,940
is the colonial background attack uh

730
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,740
this will be our concluding wise story

731
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:11,880
uh event so Colonial Colonial is one of

732
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,659
the biggest uh companies from oil uh

733
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:18,539
Transportation on gas utilization it is

734
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:20,340
one of the biggest pipeline in the east

735
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:23,460
coast of the USA we can see the pipeline

736
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,799
and the Parkland route on the on the

737
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:27,840
picture of the right uh this is the

738
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,600
largest pipeline system for refinery in

739
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,380
the US uh more than 50 of the fuel

740
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,539
consume in the east coast is actually

741
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:39,080
arriving through these pipeline systems

742
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:43,260
uh and it's really really important in

743
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,720
the aspect of oil and gas uh from

744
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,240
anything

745
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,700
and yeah it was attacked and it was

746
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,279
attacked really really bad so on the

747
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,179
19th May uh the colonial uh company

748
00:33:57,179 --> 00:33:59,279
shuts down it's applied the colonial

749
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,399
Pipeline and why it was doing that it

750
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:05,159
was doing that because the PCS managed

751
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:06,899
the colonial program got attacked by

752
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:09,300
ransomware they will notice this runs

753
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,719
over uh was going on and they will

754
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,879
immediately uh shutting down the system

755
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,599
and handling that uh the attacker will

756
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:21,000
probably use the attacker was probably

757
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,139
used some unused and old VPN account a

758
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:27,500
password they found in dark web without

759
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,699
multi-factor authentication without a

760
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:32,399
factor authentication really bad and

761
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,280
then also the buying Administration

762
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:39,060
involving that and and also enter enter

763
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,219
into the picture and helping them the

764
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:44,239
FBI actually corresponds and and and and

765
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,099
managing uh helping managing the effect

766
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:48,899
as well

767
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:50,940
um you know this is really a nation

768
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,000
state kind of thing that really is that

769
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,339
widely uh important subjects so they

770
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:59,640
were really trying uh to help the uh in

771
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,220
this course of events uh the timeline of

772
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:06,119
this attack was on this well it was

773
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:10,020
assumed to be on the 16th of May 20 2021

774
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:13,020
and

775
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,460
uh probably as I told you with this

776
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,839
click that password they were

777
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,900
infiltration infiltrating the systems uh

778
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,200
the ransomware starts on the 7th May the

779
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,180
news government military form and the

780
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,960
pipeline has also taking uh to minimize

781
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,119
the exposure uh you would ask yourself

782
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:38,579
like removing shutting down all the

783
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:40,560
pipeline but remember that at this point

784
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,660
they didn't know if the attackers were

785
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,760
actually trying to manipulate and even

786
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,800
damage their the power and says they

787
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,660
didn't know anything like that's that's

788
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,119
really important point so I believe that

789
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,700
they've been doing correctly uh taking

790
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,800
down the pipeline to minimize the

791
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,540
exposure and the impact and the blood

792
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,880
strategies of the attack itself few

793
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,420
hours corresponding and we've supervised

794
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,880
by the FBI you're actually paying so

795
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,119
they were paying around

796
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:13,859
around 4 4.4 million dollar uh 75

797
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:16,920
Bitcoins to the attackers themselves and

798
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,380
couple of days later five days later the

799
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,960
pipeline is fully restored but we can

800
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,540
see here uh that

801
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:28,380
it wasn't uh restored without any impact

802
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,380
without any damage uh many pipelines

803
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,540
many by our main gas stations were

804
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,180
actually impacted uh gas prices went

805
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,520
High we'll talk about it a little bit uh

806
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,520
later in the slides uh so regarding the

807
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,920
APT group it should be the dark side

808
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,200
group this Amity group soon to come out

809
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,780
from Eastern Europe or Russia I guess

810
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,000
this uh interesting business model which

811
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,460
called Ross roswell's service model

812
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:57,359
which they operate uh run solar Services

813
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,040
they will

814
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,160
um they will help attackers incorporate

815
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,440
with attackers to deploy The Ransom and

816
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,380
take shares uh take cuts of the of the

817
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,500
deal itself they develop also the the

818
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,079
malware itself this is the notice

819
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:16,440
they're doing uh on the 2021 it was

820
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,480
called the dark side on somewhere uh

821
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,980
this year it's called the black matter

822
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,079
will run somewhere the changing names

823
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,400
probably uh a more advanced uh malware

824
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,800
some splitting in the school but again

825
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,560
this group is really evolved in really

826
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,480
doing much much damage out there in the

827
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,119
world uh related reverse engineering

828
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:39,060
this threat we can see that it tries to

829
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,700
delete the backups again each removal

830
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:44,339
Shadow copies from the system it removes

831
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:46,140
all the backup Services we can see the

832
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,900
backup Services uh being queried we can

833
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,540
see uh the there's so many the

834
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,880
interesting backup Services you try to

835
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,700
move all of them from the system and it

836
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,220
tries uh it uses for first encryption

837
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:02,640
symmetry piece and it is really it what

838
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,380
it does is really interesting you

839
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,359
Generate random symmetric Keys correctly

840
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:10,079
it encrypts the system with salsa 20 uh

841
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,720
with the sigmatics with this symmetrics

842
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,780
uh symmetric keys and afterwards it

843
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,460
doesn't need to send any of these Keys

844
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,920
it just encrypts all of the skills the

845
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,200
public key embedded in this front

846
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,320
somewhere and remove all signs with this

847
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,079
key and evidence out there

848
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,599
and this is the square of operation the

849
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,700
impact again really really high impact

850
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,220
uh there was a temporary actually full

851
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,500
shortage we can show we can sell the

852
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,619
left picture around for five days

853
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:44,400
uh some areas without gas uh we can see

854
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,880
on the left picture gas station being uh

855
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,359
uh uh rushed by so many cars so many

856
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,720
cars waiting for uh for gas uh more than

857
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,760
70 percent of the filling station around

858
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,920
areas from North Carolina to South

859
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,339
Virginia went out of gas people were

860
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:04,260
buying like Panic buying more and more

861
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,900
buying which led for shortage which

862
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:11,400
ledge for sorry for gas prices going up

863
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,740
and the eyes in disease on the right

864
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,859
picture we can see a gas station and

865
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:19,680
disabled because no gas transmission

866
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,800
problems stuff like that

867
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,800
um but wait a second you mess with the

868
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,040
FBI and there that was the point that

869
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:34,040
the FBI got in line got into uh uh

870
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,900
evolved into the involved in the in the

871
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:41,400
scenario and trying to to do its way uh

872
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,140
um to dealing with these threat actors

873
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,839
it was a really nice that matter and as

874
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,460
a nation state matter Biden was

875
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,859
threatening also this group threatening

876
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:52,280
the attackers will be

877
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:56,099
will be dealt with and every refmi

878
00:39:56,099 --> 00:40:00,260
definitely why sorry the FBI statement

879
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:05,099
uh around the 14 was actually uh uh a

880
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:09,960
couple of days before on the uh uh sorry

881
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,079
a couple of days before uh the that

882
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:16,320
thing was happening and on the 13 the

883
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,380
dark side group came out of the world

884
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:22,079
where the servers does not exist the

885
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,180
servers the last video of the servers

886
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:27,300
the National Floor uh the money many of

887
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,820
the the some large portion of this money

888
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,820
probably and stuff like that and it

889
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,800
seemed to be linked in a sense the FBI

890
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,500
took actions uh to mitigate these threat

891
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,780
actors so the aftermath on the seventh

892
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,020
that we're the FBI actually recovers

893
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,460
around 2 million dollars for the

894
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,619
attackers themselves they acquired the

895
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:48,720
private keys from before the wallets and

896
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,660
decrypt and maintain the Privacy with

897
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,940
probably seem to be we don't know really

898
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,280
how they they managed to do it but

899
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,640
assume to be down like that you can see

900
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,920
that uh there were they were recovering

901
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,579
64 Bitcoin but uh because probably it

902
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:08,099
was almost only because but the Bitcoin

903
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:11,099
was went down so they actually lost uh

904
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:12,839
loads of money probably because of that

905
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:14,460
as well

906
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:18,839
um on the 2007 of June uh also their

907
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:20,820
service the dark side server went down

908
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:23,520
and removed completely uh I don't know

909
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,200
what they are there but create shocked

910
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,660
for doing that on the Ava mat was

911
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,820
actually a congressional hearing on the

912
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,940
subject with the colonial pipeline CEO

913
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,400
um we can see here and it is actually

914
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,619
admitting we didn't know at the time we

915
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:39,839
didn't have the answer was the pipeline

916
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,480
was actually changed for days and

917
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,339
typically it is not something that

918
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:46,380
actually does so they didn't really know

919
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,420
they assumed they didn't change their

920
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,520
pipelines but it wouldn't have been much

921
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,220
much was uh if they weren't uh

922
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:58,380
in the things inside the systems and

923
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,480
they didn't disable in the pipeline

924
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,900
itself and as the the Joseph planned the

925
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,660
colonial providence CEO said uh even the

926
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:09,900
best in class is still suspectable so

927
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,760
lessons we can learn from that that

928
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,940
attack is that well do the basics clear

929
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,980
your unused account unable to factor

930
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,560
authentication backups and and data

931
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,740
guarding assume attack would happen set

932
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,099
up your emergency response plan IO plans

933
00:42:25,099 --> 00:42:28,140
make all your plans ready for for

934
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,119
attacks because attack will happen and

935
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:32,220
you want to minimize your attack radius

936
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,380
your blast values

937
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:38,099
um look over the Legacy entries Legacy

938
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:41,460
systems uh all user all the apps fix and

939
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:45,180
update them and manage these systems

940
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,280
um get the best out of each expert each

941
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,680
expert has its own kind of expertise as

942
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,900
its owner kind of uniqueness raise your

943
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,060

944
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:57,060

this was about the first attack uh this

950
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,180
conclusions are all stories in here I

951
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,400
want to thank you all uh for this

952

amazing opportunity to speak about this

953
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,960
interesting astonishing attacks I will

954
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,020
embarack from Wild pointer uh please you

955
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,000
can follow me on Twitter link to

956
