00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,960
hi everyone my name is chloe with miss

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,319
dary and today we're going to talk about

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:05,200
hacker rights

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,879
i first want to say thank you to rootcon

5
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,440
for having me i'm excited to be here

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,840
so let's dive into it let me share my

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,480
screen

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,800
hold on one second

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,570
all right here we go

10
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,240
[Music]

11
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,160
hopefully you'll see my screen but we're

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,680
going to talk about

13
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,439
hikers don't wear black hoodies they

14
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,439
wear capes and yes

15
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,359
granted i'm pretty sure many of us own a

16
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,199
black hoodie let's be real

17
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,800
that doesn't identify that we are

18
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,559
hackers ourselves it's just very

19
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:35,280
comfortable

20
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,440
most of the time and black goes with the

21
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,800
color of my heart

22
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,920
anyway let's do this um i just want to

23
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,280
say that this talk is completely

24
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,000
dedicated to

25
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,600
all the hackers who's ever been scared

26
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,520
to disclose to all the hackers who've

27
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,960
been prosecuted for trying to do

28
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,840
something good or doing their actual job

29
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,280
and to all the people who are in the

30
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,399
fight to bring rights for hackers

31
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,239
if you don't know who i am once again my

32
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,800
name is chloe mustaghi i'm a vp strategy

33
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,239
over at point three security

34
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,119
but i'm also a hacker advocate and

35
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:05,920
activist

36
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,000
i've been pushing for rights for hackers

37
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,280
in the space

38
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,080
and i'm still continuing to do so to

39
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,799
this day

40
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,799
i actually co-founded an organization

41
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,799
called hacking is not a crime

42
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,000
war is a one-stop shop for you basically

43
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,479
to

44
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,000
know all the organizations that are

45
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,680
working within the hacker community

46
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,759
and pushing for rights and also what are

47
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,280
some actions that you can do to

48
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,159
participate

49
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,360
and trying to bring about a change most

50
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,119
the person co-founder of rosac which is

51
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,400
women of security

52
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,560
in the founder we are hackers formerly

53
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,240
known as women hackers

54
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,280
also the podcaster for itsp magazine the

55
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,560
uncommon journey with phil

56
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,720
wiley and alyssa miller when i'm not

57
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,799
doing that i'm also the hacker book club

58
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,079
organizer which meets

59
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,600
every tuesday at 5 00 pm pacific time

60
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,399
um and we read a new book every month

61
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,119
and so

62
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,880
that book itself is usually written by

63
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,399
someone in the hacker community

64
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,799
and us as members of the hacker book

65
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,520
club are also hacker community members

66
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,960
so it's kind of a nice thing because we

67
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,799
get to all come together as a hacker

68
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,600
group

69
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,120
to support one another um that is my url

70
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,400
if there's anything you want to know

71
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,840
about me it's most likely

72
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,080
on there and also that's my twitter and

73
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,520
instagram handle

74
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,400
uh feel free to dm anytime idms are open

75
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,319
but also feel free to follow

76
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,840
all right let's get into the real stuff

77
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,239
now so first things first we're going to

78
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,840
cover the current landscape and i know

79
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,360
this is a scary subject

80
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,599
for many of us but we're going to do

81
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,959
this together i promise

82
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,360
now you probably remember the equifax

83
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,360
breach but did you know that about

84
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,519
six months before the breach made

85
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,400
headlines

86
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,959
a hacker notified equifax of the

87
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,560
vulnerability

88
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,040
um ahead of time but they didn't patch

89
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,440
it they didn't do anything about it

90
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,959
um and this was something that showed in

91
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,360
their records um and also it's one of

92
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,920
those things that like

93
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,560
we see this often as hackers when we

94
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,519
disclose something

95
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,560
that basically it's either ignored

96
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,599
or um it's misinterpreted in the wrong

97
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,519
way

98
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,159
or the capital one breach where actually

99
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,599
what happened was that according to the

100
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,360
federal complaint the bridge took place

101
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,720
in stages across march and april 2019

102
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,640
but camera one only became more of the

103
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,400
problem on july 17th

104
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,879
when a secure researcher tipped the

105
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,720
company to a public github page that

106
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,319
was displaying something that looked an

107
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,200
awful lot like capital one private data

108
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,720
but what if no one reported the breach

109
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,480
and unfortunately sixty percent of

110
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,959
researchers don't report vulnerabilities

111
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,640
and this was something that

112
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,480
uh amit elizard that you see in the

113
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,400
corner there she basically

114
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,400
did research about possibilities of

115
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,239
having safe harbor in the hacker

116
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,680
community

117
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,760
another statistic that came out was with

118
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,080
hacker one they have a 2018 hacker

119
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,920
report which basically surveyed

120
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,400
their hacker community and found that

121
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,360
almost one

122
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,480
out of four hackers do not report of

123
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,519
honorably

124
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,439
because the company in question didn't

125
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,360
have a vdp

126
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,120
um those who did try to notify the

127
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,640
company through other channels such as

128
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,000
email or social media

129
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,040
hello dms on twitter um

130
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,798
claim that they were frequently ignored

131
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,959
or misunderstood

132
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,160
and these are the reasons why

133
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,560
we have a problem because the reason

134
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,400
that there were not report things is

135
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,199
because of the fear being prosecuted

136
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,520
and that's the one takeaway of the

137
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,560
current landscape

138
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,120
so like i said why are hackers scared

139
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,040
the fear of prosecution

140
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,280
not knowing who to contact to disclose

141
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,960
if they don't have a program

142
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,720
or even if they have a program whether

143
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,440
or not their policies are understandable

144
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,120
to understand what's in scope or out of

145
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,600
scope

146
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,240
can be really a burden sometimes and i

147
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,600
know that when looking for contact

148
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,080
information

149
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,400
sometimes it takes hours days weeks and

150
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,600
then you get to a point where like

151
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,960
is it even worth it and even if you're

152
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,759
hired at a company and you have

153
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,560
permission

154
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,160
to do so to hack into a system

155
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,440
you can still get prosecuted so i want

156
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,280
to dive into two case studies the first

157
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,120
one is with dji

158
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,440
um a famous drone manufacturer as you're

159
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,720
probably aware

160
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,199
but one thing to note is that a long

161
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,560
time ago they decided they wanted to

162
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,720
start their own bug batting program

163
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,160
so that means that they didn't want to

164
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,759
do they wanted to do it in-house they

165
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,360
didn't want to work with hacker one by

166
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,120
crowd or sin act or any of that they

167
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,840
wanted to do

168
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,639
their own but they didn't really fully

169
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,320
researched it and so there were some

170
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,840
issues with it

171
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,320
so two researchers or i like to say

172
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:42,960
hackers

173
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,639
because hackers are people that stay

174
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,039
within scope and don't exploit

175
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,759
and that's what shawn and kevin were

176
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,720
doing

177
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,840
so sean and kevin basically two hackers

178
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,680
came across the bug bounty program and

179
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,280
for the scope it covered

180
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,960
all security issues and firmware

181
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,639
application servers including source

182
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,680
code leak

183
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,560
and secure workaround and privacy issue

184
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,199
kevin then

185
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,039
emailed dji to reconfirm the scope

186
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,240
and it took them two weeks to respond so

187
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,759
that's not really letting you know

188
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,319
there's a communication issue or

189
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,160
someone's not managing this program

190
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,000
properly or they didn't do the research

191
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,360
the fact that it took two weeks for them

192
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,759
just to say yes what you saw on our

193
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,840
website is yes that is true

194
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,440
that is within scope they can't even do

195
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,600
that a faster time

196
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,720
but anyway so he then proceeded to

197
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,319
report a vulnerability

198
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,680
remember the zona brilliant he stayed

199
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,759
within scope he didn't exploit

200
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,560
dji turn around like congratulations

201
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,440
here's 30

202
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,479
000 for what you found

203
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,560
now the only problem is that it came

204
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,479
with a catch which was

205
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,120
if he signs a contract it offered no

206
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,639
protection for him

207
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,120
so basically he walked away from it

208
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,880
because he wanted to protect himself

209
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,720
more than whatever the amount of money

210
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,639
that they were going to give him

211
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,800
so he basically walked away but what

212
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,240
happened was that dji

213
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,960
internally saw him as a threat so they

214
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,160
decided to

215
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,680
give him a lawsuit tied to the cfaa

216
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,360
which is the computer fraud and abuse

217
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,360
act claiming he went out of scope

218
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,800
when it regards he actually stayed

219
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,560
within scope he then

220
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,720
was like okay you want to do this with

221
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,080
the hard way fine

222
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,560
so he posted every single internal

223
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,160
conversation

224
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,400
showing evidence of the entire paper

225
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,240
trial that he had

226
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,039
about what happened to him in dji and of

227
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,000
course dji

228
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,080
it was a very bad pr thing and they

229
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,400
pulled out

230
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,919
but it was just one of those reminders

231
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,000
that you can actually face this

232
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,080
regardless if you're in scope and you're

233
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,319
not exploiting you still have to worry

234
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:46,879
about

235
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,120
companies coming after you saying that

236
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,199
you broke the cfa

237
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,039
now let's go into another one so this

238
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,400
one is a

239
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,720
physical security case but something

240
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,919
important to know

241
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,960
so in september 2019 to iowa

242
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,440
state i mean the iowa state asked the

243
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,039
cyber security company

244
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,280
called coal fire to connect a

245
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,120
penetration test to see if it staff can

246
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,520
gain

247
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,319
access to sensitive data or equipment

248
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,319
now the two coal fire employees found a

249
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:14,879
door to

250
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,120
dallas courthouse open and when they

251
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,000
closed the door

252
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,800
to see if it would lock the alarm went

253
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,840
off

254
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,000
following the protocol the employees

255
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,440
wait for the police to arrive and show

256
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:25,759
them

257
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,160
their paperwork and initially they were

258
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,120
told they were good to go

259
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,120
however a local sheriff appeared on the

260
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,039
scene and actually arrested them and

261
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,120
they had to spend a night in jail

262
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,519
the charges were later dropped this year

263
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,120
late in january

264
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,799
however it's one of those examples that

265
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,599
even if you're hired to do this type of

266
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,240
work

267
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,600
you can still get prosecuted and that is

268
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,959
the one thing we need to

269
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,000
understand is that there are

270
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,200
we are missing a good starting law that

271
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,160
could protect

272
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,200
our peers from this type of prosecution

273
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
but also it's one of the things that

274
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,120
it's a reminder that people still in the

275
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,839
public

276
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,200
don't know the difference between a

277
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,760
hacker and an attacker

278
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,040
and for those that do not know the

279
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,839
difference between a hacker and attacker

280
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,120
a hacker is one once again that stays in

281
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,640
scope and doesn't exploit

282
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,320
an attacker goes out of scope

283
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,440
and exploits but overall community

284
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,560
consensus is

285
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,360
that language of what's in scope or out

286
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,800
of scope can be

287
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,040
very hard to understand but also when

288
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,399
disclosing it's also a challenge too

289
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,920
especially with the potential

290
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,480
indictments especially it does keep all

291
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,200
parties

292
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
up all at night because program managers

293
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,959
are asking to be hacked but not get

294
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:43,360
hacked

295
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,160
badly um and how to conduct handle

296
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,959
situations

297
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,959
when hackers are reporting something is

298
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,720
something that they can all work on to

299
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,160
be honest

300
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,480
but overall organizations and government

301
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,360
they do

302
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,320
believe that having some sort of way to

303
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,120
disclose

304
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,160
it is critical for their security and to

305
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,160
protect consumers

306
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,640
and so it is needed to have but we're

307
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,519
still running

308
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,720
into a wall and i know this is a scary

309
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,079
subject once again

310
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,160
but here are some puppies to lift your

311
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,519
spirits and

312
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,519
um there is a cat for cat lovers because

313
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,760
i know you guys exist

314
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,839
as myself i own two shivas which are

315
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,399
pups so i'm very much a dog lover as you

316
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,760
can tell by this slide

317
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,360
all right let's keep going

318
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,720
so why is the public scared of us and

319
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,320
this is the thing we need to understand

320
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,920
with empathy

321
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,360
one thing first is that even though

322
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,519
hackers are not malicious actors just

323
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,800
still being seen

324
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,240
as such and treat it as such

325
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,680
and the reason for that is that it

326
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,600
reduces the chances of

327
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,240
like having an ability to report a

328
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,839
vulnerability and to be taken

329
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,959
seriously instead of seeing us as

330
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,680
um people that are up to mischief and no

331
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,560
good

332
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,640
and the unfortunate thing is that the

333
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,000
imagery around the

334
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,680
term hacker is very much a dark-hooded

335
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,720
figure in their basement as you can see

336
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,160
in this image itself this is what

337
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,160
happens when you type an ethical hacker

338
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,279
and criminal hacker

339
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,959
you don't really see any difference

340
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,399
between the two sides

341
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,040
even though one has permission the other

342
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,079
one doesn't

343
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,600
and that's the thing we need to

344
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,600
understand is that the public sees this

345
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,640
imagery

346
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,399
and already assumes that we are a

347
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,760
criminal because

348
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,600
of these images that are keep being

349
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,880
portrayed in the media

350
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,360
but it's not just the imagery itself

351
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,360
that's holding us back from society for

352
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,160
understanding

353
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,800
who we are as a hacker community but

354
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,040
also the language used in the media

355
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,720
and when i mean the media i mean

356
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,560
marketing and press

357
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,120
using the term hacker as someone who is

358
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,720
a criminal

359
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,959
is the thing that needs to change the

360
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,320
thing is is that they should be using

361
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,600
the term attacker

362
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,399
cyber criminal malicious actor and so on

363
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,320
and using the term hacker for someone

364
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,480
who's being the super hero every day

365
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,560
so how does this imagery and language

366
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,160
impact us so the one thing i want to

367
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,639
cover

368
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,519
here as you guys already probably know

369
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,639
is i'm obsessed

370
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,480
with the brain if you've seen any of my

371
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,079
talks prior to this

372
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,320
i always talk about human behavior and

373
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,440
cognitive science

374
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,720
and the brain is one of those things

375
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,120
that makes us understand how humans

376
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,000
behave but the thing is is that this

377
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,200
imagery and language

378
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,399
what it does is that it feeds this

379
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,839
fear is based on stereotypes and biases

380
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,040
of what hackers are and who we

381
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,519
are and this is through this process

382
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,160
called socially constructive beliefs

383
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,600
if you're wondering what is a socially

384
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,240
contracted belief well

385
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,600
socially constructive beliefs are

386
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,279
basically anything that you learn

387
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,720
directly or indirectly from your

388
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,800
surroundings this could be from teachers

389
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,360
parents

390
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,000
friends family this could be the news it

391
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,480
could be

392
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,560
in movies it could be in books but

393
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,240
basically something that tells you

394
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,560
something that is safe and not something

395
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,959
that isn't safe and basically they're

396
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,399
the beliefs that

397
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,480
are fully ingrained in your mind and

398
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,320
that you take actions on

399
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,720
based on that so now you know what

400
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,560
socially constructive beliefs are let's

401
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,760
dive into the brain

402
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,200
so first things first what we have to

403
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,600
cover is how does fear work

404
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,200
so remember that socially constructed

405
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,519
beliefs well that actually is stemmed in

406
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,560
your temporal lobe

407
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,399
and within the temporal lobe itself

408
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,680
there is this part

409
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,040
of your brain um it's actually it's a

410
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,440
tissue that's a shape of an almond not

411
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,279
too big at all to be honest

412
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,480
um but it's a subconscious place in your

413
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,160
brain called the amygdala

414
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,279
now you've probably heard that in

415
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,680
mandela before as the fight versus

416
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,120
flight mechanism

417
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,560
but one thing you need to know about

418
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,800
this survival mechanism itself

419
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,120
is also programmed to sort who is like

420
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,800
me who is not like me

421
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,680
so people outside of your circle or your

422
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,240
bubble

423
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,880
or your world those are people that

424
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,480
you're gonna be a little bit more

425
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,720
cautious around because trust is

426
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,680
earned um and it has to be very very

427
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,600
much earned if it's outside of some

428
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,199
bubble

429
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,199
trust is so much easier to have with

430
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,120
another person if they share something

431
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,480
in common with you

432
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,079
and this could be the way that you look

433
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,680
your background your culture

434
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,880
your religion uh your gender

435
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,240
any of that there is this sense of

436
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,240
we understand each other because you're

437
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,399
not stranger danger however anyone who

438
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,279
isn't

439
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,320
you or like you or someone who's outside

440
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,800
of your circle your social circle

441
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,279
that person could be stranger danger and

442
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,959
so the best way how to talk about this

443
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,120
is i want you to imagine that

444
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,360
when you were little you're watching

445
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,519
movies and you basically were told

446
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,680
indirectly and directly that people with

447
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,199
pink hair are very

448
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,760
very dangerous these people are the ones

449
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,279
that are

450
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,680
having gangs and they're the ones that

451
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,639
are causing

452
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,800
mischief they're the ones that are

453
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,040
breaking into stores they're the ones

454
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,680
that are

455
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,959
caught are kidnapping people they're the

456
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,880
ones that are always the bad guys in the

457
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,600
movies

458
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,839
so pink hair people are seen as

459
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,440
dangerous

460
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,000
you've probably also heard from a parent

461
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,839
or a teacher that pin care people are

462
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:18,959
dangerous

463
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,959
so thus what happens is that when you're

464
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,720
walking down the street and someone pink

465
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,360
hair is behind you

466
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,160
your amygdala is lit up saying warning

467
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,120
warning

468
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,399
danger stranger danger there's a big

469
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,639
care person behind you

470
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,120
act so then that signal goes to the

471
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,240
prefrontal cortex of your brain

472
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,160
and what is in the prefrontal cortex of

473
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,600
your brain itself

474
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,240
it is the time where you are the ceo of

475
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,040
your brain

476
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,600
you can question use logic to break down

477
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,160
to see

478
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,880
what actions are best to take so even

479
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,079
though the amygdala is completely

480
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,040
subconscious

481
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,959
this part of your brain is completely

482
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,639
consciously aware

483
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,240
so when that person with pain cares

484
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,920
behind you the meg does like warning

485
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,240
more

486
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,240
stranger that signal goes to the

487
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,240
prefrontal cortex of your head which is

488
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,000
right in the front right here

489
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,639
and at that moment what happens is is

490
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,680
that

491
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,199
you are thinking the following actions

492
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,320
one i collect my bag a little bit closer

493
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,680
just in case if they're trying to steal

494
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,440
something from me i can walk a little

495
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,720
bit faster too

496
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,360
in case they're trying to mug me i can

497
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,880
cross the street

498
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,440
so then they don't follow me or i can

499
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,920
walk into a store

500
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,639
so all of those examples are i'm trying

501
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,959
to escape from a situation

502
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,160
it's a fight versus flight situation

503
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,639
i'm in a strange or dangerous situation

504
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,199
because

505
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,440
i've been told and i socially

506
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,720
constructed belief

507
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,040
that can care people are dangerous now

508
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,120
the thing is i just want to state this

509
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,680
for

510
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,680
for one thing the only difference

511
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,880
between you

512
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,360
and that person with pink hair is just

513
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,279
that they have pink hair

514
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,360
however because you've been trained to

515
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,519
believe that someone with pink hair is a

516
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,000
dangerous

517
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,720
individual you strongly believe in it

518
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,599
and it's as if

519
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,480
it's in your dna now the thing is to

520
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:10,880
note

521
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,760
is that there is a way you can challenge

522
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,439
these socially constructed beliefs

523
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,559
because sometimes

524
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,760
they're not right sometimes they're very

525
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,720
inc they're not correct at all so for

526
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,679
example

527
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,480
what say for example you were on your

528
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,520
youtube and you're

529
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,039
looking through videos and you found a

530
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,960
video of someone with pink hair

531
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,679
talking about how hard it is to be sung

532
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:34,880
with pink hair

533
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,559
and that person with pink hair was

534
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,320
talking about how everyone sees them as

535
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,600
a criminal

536
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,160
not just a criminal but that they can't

537
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,080
even get a job sometimes that

538
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,200
it's very hard to uh climb the ladder

539
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,760
because they're only seen as this lower

540
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,919
person this person pink hair

541
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,799
and it's not taken seriously or this

542
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,960
person with pink hair every time they go

543
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,720
into an elevator someone gets out

544
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,160
immediately out of fear

545
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,080
or locks their door when they see them

546
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,320
near in their car

547
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,640
this pink hair person tells you in a

548
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,600
youtube video

549
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,039
how hard it is for them now at that

550
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,880
moment you might be taking a step back

551
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,000
and being like

552
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,320
i wonder if i did anything wrong if i've

553
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,080
done anything wrong to this person with

554
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,000
pink hair i don't think

555
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,160
i'm i have a problem with people with

556
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,440
pink hair

557
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,280
but you know i'm curious never done

558
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,280
anything here

559
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,799
now the next time you're walking down

560
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,799
the street and you're there's someone

561
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,039
pink hair behind you walking

562
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,640
you're making a sense of single once

563
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,640
again because the subconscious

564
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,640
warning warning stranger danger there's

565
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,640
someone pin care behind you

566
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,480
your brain go through the same thing

567
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,840
which is all right these are the

568
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,600
following actions that i can take

569
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
to get away from the person in care

570
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,440
because my socially constructed belief

571
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,799
is that person with me care is a

572
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,559
dangerous individual

573
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,120
so i can either clutch my bag and walk

574
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,400
faster

575
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,520
or i could cross the street or

576
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,400
i can go into a store so then this

577
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:02,880
person

578
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,559
can't be near me and i can get away

579
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,520
just in case this person is a criminal

580
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,000
but then

581
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,799
also something new pops in your head you

582
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:13,679
remember that

583
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,600
video that youtube video that person

584
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
with pink hair talking about how hard it

585
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,280
is to be someone can care

586
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,120
and that everyone sees you as a criminal

587
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,640
and that it hurts you so

588
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,320
deeply that every time

589
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,880
your the person was with pink hair went

590
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,039
into an elbow they left immediately they

591
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,720
locked their car doors

592
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,240
and how much that impacted them when

593
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,160
they saw someone clutch their bag across

594
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,320
the street or going to a store

595
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,200
to get away from them and at that moment

596
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,559
you're making a conscious

597
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,679
decision to question your socially

598
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,360
constructive beliefs

599
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,360
and to take a different action an action

600
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,440
you haven't really taken before

601
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,280
because there's new knowledge here

602
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,440
there's this new sense of awareness that

603
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,360
maybe you're part of a problem

604
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,400
so at that moment you decide to send a

605
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,679
signal back to amiga

606
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,320
to calm down to take a chance because

607
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,918
that video really touched you

608
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,320
what this whole thing i'm trying to

609
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,000
showcase here is that

610
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,960
we all have the ability to question our

611
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,640
socially constructive beliefs

612
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,640
or the beliefs that we have that the

613
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,240
world works

614
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,320
but the only way that we can do so we

615
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,440
have to get outside

616
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,240
our bubble we have to get uncomfortable

617
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,840
with the uncomfortableness

618
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,559
we have to be okay to question ourselves

619
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,360
and our narratives and our beliefs

620
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,280
and always ask the question am i being a

621
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,799
good citizen right now

622
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,720
how can i be a better person in this

623
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,720
world

624
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,400
this is the point where i should

625
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,000
probably turn around and say

626
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,240
now that's how people also see

627
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,880
other groups of people and for the

628
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,120
hacker community

629
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,679
that's what people see us as the public

630
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:00,159
sees

631
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,480
us as criminals so when we're wearing

632
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,200
that black hoodie or we're coding

633
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,760
or we are out there and we tell someone

634
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,880
we're a hacker

635
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,720
they might take a step back their mouth

636
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,400
might drop their eyes might get bigger

637
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,000
or they'll try to find a way to escape

638
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,440
the conversation

639
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,480
because it's so uncomfortable for them

640
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,679
to be near you

641
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,840
because they have a socially constructed

642
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,039
belief

643
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,360
because of the movies the things they

644
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,720
read in the news

645
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,799
from everything that they've been told

646
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,000
that hackers are

647
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,200
bad people they are criminals

648
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,640
and until we can challenge that belief

649
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,200
and work with that belief and try to get

650
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,240
the public to see

651
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,280
a different perspective we will never

652
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,320
have any change because

653
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,880
this fear this socially constructed

654
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,520
beliefs

655
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,720
these this mindset set by society by the

656
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,200
people

657
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,400
and the media of the public of who is a

658
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,200
hacker

659
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,679
and what is a hacker and seeing us in a

660
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,840
devious light

661
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,840
is keeping us not safe and is preventing

662
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,159
hackers what we do best which is

663
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,400
protecting the people that we love

664
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,360
and trying to be of a service to this

665
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,640
world to protect

666
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,919
people because at this time

667
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,840
more companies are becoming more open to

668
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,200
receiving information about

669
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,320
vulnerabilities

670
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,919
however still 94 of the forbes 2000

671
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,360
global list

672
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,320
doesn't have a vdp program and this is

673
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,240
something we may come to regret at this

674
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,120
time

675
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,880
because companies are afraid of hackers

676
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,080
and they don't want to create

677
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,240
vulnerability disclosure programs or

678
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,039
policies

679
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,039
because there's a lack of a bilateral

680
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,640
trust amongst hackers

681
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,679
and organizations slash government it's

682
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:46,559
one of the reasons

683
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,360
why to this day 60 percent don't have

684
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,159
honor

685
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,000
bill they don't report vulnerabilities

686
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
to hackers that is

687
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,760
and why hackers are scared of outdated

688
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,080
lawsuits for the cfa and dmca but this

689
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,840
is also the reason why

690
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,600
companies don't have a vulnerability

691
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,440
disclosure policy because they are

692
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,280
afraid of us because of the narrative

693
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,799
the socially constructive beliefs that

694
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,640
they have

695
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,880
also from interviewing attackers they

696
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,960
themselves the reason why they switched

697
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,200
from being a hacker to an attacker was

698
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,480
because of the pay

699
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,559
but also because they were seen exactly

700
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,080
the same regardless if they stayed

701
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,960
within scope or outside the scope

702
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,799
and this is also true to the other way

703
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,280
the reason why attackers switched to

704
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,000
becoming

705
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,840
hackers was because of the insomnia of

706
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,760
being arrested and just wanted to be in

707
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,960
a better light in the end

708
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,760
so we have to dive into the worldwide

709
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,120
legislation like i mentioned a little

710
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,320
bit earlier before

711
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,600
is that the fear that society has of us

712
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,840
and the socially constructive beliefs

713
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,080
that they have of the hacker community

714
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,279
has prevented us from having rights and

715
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,279
we have legislation that is very much

716
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:58,159
out of date

717
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,279
that was created out of fear without any

718
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,919
representation of the hacker community

719
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,840
and this is why it hurts us the most

720
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,919
whenever we have legislation that is

721
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:08,320
passed

722
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,720
and all parties that would be impacted

723
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,440
by it are not represented at the table

724
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,400
people get hurt and people don't have a

725
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,440
voice

726
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,919
and we don't have equity either so it's

727
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,440
so important is to have proper

728
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,279
representation when it comes to

729
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,159
legislation now all around the world we

730
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,679
have anti-hacking laws

731
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,520
anti-circumvention laws which are also

732
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,960
copyright laws

733
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,919
and also acceptable use policy all

734
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:34,880
around the world

735
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,559
and i know this looks u.s soundtrack to

736
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,640
be honest but the thing is is that the

737
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,200
u.s set the standard of legislation that

738
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,559
the rest of the world followed when it

739
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,200
came to

740
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,159
hackers so let's first dive into the

741
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,679
computer front abuse act

742
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,799
so cfa is a united states cyber security

743
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,960
bill that was enacted in 1984 as an

744
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,760
amendment to existing computer fraud law

745
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,279
which had been included in the

746
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,159
comprehensive crime control act of 1984

747
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,000
the law prohibits accessing a computer

748
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,080
without authorization or an excess of

749
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,279
authorization

750
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,120
also to be used when a researcher goes

751
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,400
out of scope

752
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,720
this is the very act used to prosecute

753
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,000
hacking

754
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,520
random fact did you know ronald reagan

755
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,200
he watched this movie called war games

756
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,600
and i'm probably you've seen it too

757
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,159
but basically uh ronald reagan when he

758
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,600
watched it he completely freaked out

759
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,919
about hackers and the capabilities that

760
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:26,799
they had

761
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,400
i was like we have to do something about

762
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,400
these hackers these dangerous

763
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,320
these dangerous kids that don't know

764
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,080
anything better

765
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,559
and then that's how the cfa was created

766
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,720
was because he watched the movie

767
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,200
and it inspired him to create some

768
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,880
legislation

769
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,880
that is called the computer fraud abuse

770
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,919
act today

771
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,120
i love the movie or games but dang if

772
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,640
only they knew that that was going to

773
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,320
end up happening i'm pretty sure they

774
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,320
would have thought twice

775
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,880
um now anti-sacrificial laws also known

776
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,400
as copyright laws

777
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,320
um the one thing to keep in mind is that

778
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,840
the dmca in the u.s

779
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,159
there hasn't been any cases that i am

780
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,200
aware of

781
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,000
hackers being prosecuted under um but

782
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,360
the one thing to note about

783
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,039
is that um when it comes to

784
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,840
the computer fraud abuse act the one

785
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,240
thing to note about it is that

786
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,520
that is the law that is used against

787
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,200
hackers

788
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
whenever a hacker goes out of scope or

789
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,440
even if they stay within scope it's the

790
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:27,760
act

791
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,880
used to prosecute all hacking

792
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,400
now the dmca is a 1998

793
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,240
us copyright law that implements two

794
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,240
1996 trees the world intellectual

795
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,080
property organization

796
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,080
uh basically seeing right to repair

797
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,159
seeing reverse engineering as a breach

798
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,320
to some companies

799
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,960
now when we come to you know acceptable

800
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,080
use policy

801
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,600
who here in the room has ever read their

802
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,679
terms and conditions for an update

803
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,720
or a product yeah i thought so i tried

804
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,480
doing that once with the apple product

805
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,279
and i got really bored also it was like

806
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,080
as if

807
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,840
one attorney was talking to another

808
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,360
attorney and i should just tell you

809
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,679
right now i am not an attorney

810
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,000
just not to let you know anytime but

811
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,600
basically

812
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,679
the thing is that it's too much verbiage

813
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:14,880
and it makes it really hard to

814
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,760
understand

815
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,880
even if you are an english speaker

816
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,799
even if you're learning english this

817
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,080
could be a huge problem

818
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,360
too because it's very hard to understand

819
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,919
and so this can lead to some serious

820
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:29,279
miscommunication issues for hackers that

821
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,080
don't really speak english

822
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,600
but overall what i want to take away

823
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,679
from this slide is that clearly the laws

824
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:36,880
are old and out of date

825
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,320
um and obviously they're created out of

826
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,480
fear once again there was no empathy

827
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,799
ever at any point of this to take the

828
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,080
time to understand what is

829
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,960
actually needed at this time and why

830
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,799
laws should only prosecute malicious

831
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:49,520
actors

832
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,880
and not good hackers

833
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,120
so in general the laws provide good

834
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,399
hacking in the same way that they

835
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:57,760
prevent attackers and we

836
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,200
really need good hacking

837
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,440
and i want to dive into the cfa a little

838
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,399
bit more because i

839
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,159
really hate this and i think you're

840
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,600
going to hate it too if you are not

841
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,520
aware of it you need to be aware of it

842
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,200
so computer fraud abuse act once again

843
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,960
was passed in 1984

844
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,039
has grown widely outdated and that it

845
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,120
offers prosecutors to

846
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,120
discretion to threaten huge potential

847
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,360
fines and gl sentences for relatively

848
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,440
underserving violations of the computer

849
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,720
policy

850
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,880
first the cfa as rich and punishes

851
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,559
exceeding authorized access to a

852
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,000
protected computer

853
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,480
a phrase big enough to inspire some very

854
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,320
broad interpretations

855
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,399
another fall in cfa is the redundant

856
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,000
provisions that enable a person to be

857
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,480
punished

858
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,039
multiple times for the same crime these

859
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,799
charges can be stacked on top

860
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,960
of another resulting a threat of a

861
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,640
higher accumulated fines and jail time

862
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,640
for the exact same violation

863
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,320
which we'll dive into that in the next

864
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,399
slide about iron sports

865
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,240
this allows prosecutors to bully defense

866
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,679
into accepting that deal in order to

867
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,760
avoid facing a multitude of charges from

868
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,679
a single solitary act

869
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,520
it also plays a significant role in

870
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,520
sentencing the ambiguity of the

871
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,240
provision

872
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,159
meant to toughen sentencing for repeat

873
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,600
offenders of cfa

874
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,919
may in fact make it possible for defense

875
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,360
to be sentenced based on

876
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,039
what should be prior convictions but

877
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,480
were nothing more than multiple

878
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,880
convictions for the same crime

879
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,880
most importantly to note the cfa also

880
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,360
gives companies the right to sue

881
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,520
hackers have more to fear from companies

882
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,480
and states right now

883
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,640
than the justice department just

884
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,399
remember that

885
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,279
um it is not the doj that's coming after

886
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:31,679
you

887
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,600
if you're a ethical hacker and you're

888
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,679
staying within scope

889
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,399
it's the local governments and companies

890
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,080
i want you to understand that because

891
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,640
that is

892
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,600
important for you to know

893
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,880
but the thing about cfa is that there

894
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,240
are

895
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,279
numerous of cases of cfa prosecuting

896
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,159
really good people and this is one of

897
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,080
those cases so aaron schwartz

898
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,279
basically in 2011 current ortez's was

899
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,559
the u.s attorney's office

900
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,799
charged schwartz with hacking to mit

901
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,080
computer network

902
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,919
to download millions of scholarly

903
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,600
articles from jstor

904
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,360
it was supposed to be an act of civil

905
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,440
disobedience meant to protest the

906
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,159
restricted

907
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,520
access to taxpayer research

908
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,960
but for this the u.s attorney brought

909
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,799
charges that carried a maximum penalty

910
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:19,039
of

911
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:23,120
35 years in prison i want to pause there

912
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,919
in the u.s the minimum of serving for

913
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,240
first degree murder is 25 years

914
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,279
in prison aaron schwartz was looking at

915
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,720
35 years in prison for one

916
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,760
act you never hurt anyone

917
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,720
you never hurt anyone i want you to

918
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,840
understand that

919
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,240
but yet that was what he was facing

920
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,240
because the way that cfa is written

921
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,440
is that you can stack upon stack of

922
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,720
years

923
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,760
and that's something you need to

924
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,080
understand because of that

925
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,480
he is facing that 35 years in prison and

926
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,640
one million dollars in fines because of

927
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,480
one act and how the cfa is written

928
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,919
overall when looking at aaron's

929
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:05,679
situation it must have been so hard for

930
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:06,399
him

931
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,960
he was dealing with a 17-month legal

932
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,240
battle with no

933
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,760
date set no idea when it was gonna end

934
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,720
anytime soon i cannot imagine how you

935
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,880
must have felt but i can definitely

936
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,240
understand that he felt

937
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,440
hopeless and because of that feeling

938
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,360
perhaps that was the reason why he took

939
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,000
his own life in his apartment

940
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,240
on january 11 2013 he was found hung

941
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,080
following his death federal prosecutors

942
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,519
went on to drop the charges

943
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,960
but his family does believe that it was

944
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,679
because

945
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,320
of the governor's prosecution it was the

946
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,200
reason why he

947
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,559
decided to take his own life because of

948
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,080
aaron's

949
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,120
horrible story this led to legislators

950
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,320
coming together

951
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,320
to create something that would be

952
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,240
amendments to the cfa

953
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,799
and this is called aaron's law this was

954
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,600
written in 2013. however it didn't pass

955
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,880
but it's still important to note of it

956
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,000
because it didn't pass

957
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,559
of the big corporations that have

958
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,080
lobbyists

959
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,919
they don't want cfa to go away they need

960
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,840
it to be vague so then they can continue

961
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,000
to prosecute

962
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,080
but aaron's law what it was going to do

963
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,519
is remove the phrase

964
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,000
exceeds authorized access and replace it

965
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,120
with excess

966
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,399
without i mean access without

967
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:28,960
authorization

968
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,559
which is defined as to obtain

969
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,000
information on a computer that the

970
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,200
accessor

971
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,200
lacks authorization to obtain by not

972
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,039
only circumventing technological or

973
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,159
physical measures

974
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,919
designed to prevent unauthorized

975
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,519
individuals from obtaining that

976
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,840
information

977
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,080
another one you need to know is about

978
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,840
the dmca

979
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,559
just overall this is very old it's from

980
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,399
1998.

981
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,559
like i said there was no cases to my

982
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,360
knowledge of the dmca being used against

983
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,440
hackers

984
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,440
but it does produce a chilling effect so

985
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,720
it's important for us to know

986
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,519
about it but basically what it does is

987
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,279
that no person shall circumvent a

988
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,120
technological measure that effectively

989
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,279
controls access to a work protected

990
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,559
under this title

991
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,480
it does contain provisions for security

992
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,559
research but in most cases

993
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,559
does not allow them breakdown defenses

994
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,480
put up by the manufacturer without prior

995
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,519
permission

996
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,679
such as those wrapped around firmware

997
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,519
basically the dmc

998
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,880
was kind of about trying to keep a tight

999
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,720
control on how consumers use their

1000
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,679
copyrighted

1001
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,679
works basically providing them in some

1002
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,519
cases for making copies of the purchased

1003
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:36,399
products

1004
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,120
for their own use or from jailbreaking

1005
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,120
smartphones or other devices

1006
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,640
to use them in ways that manufacturers

1007
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,200
disliked

1008
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,720
but with improvements to legislation we

1009
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,399
can change where we stand

1010
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,200
right at this moment but like i said to

1011
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,279
be able to do that we have to change the

1012
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,480
public perception

1013
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,039
of who we are as hackers and to

1014
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,240
understand

1015
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,159
that their socially constructive beliefs

1016
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,799
of what is a hacker who is a hacker

1017
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,239
is not correct because that is the one

1018
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,760
thing to bring about public change you

1019
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,918
need public awareness and a public to

1020
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:12,399
push

1021
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,760
for it so how are we going to influence

1022
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,119
the public cycle or

1023
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,719
why we need to influence the public

1024
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,879
cycle or how do we do this well

1025
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,320
in order to have rights for hackers we

1026
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,079
need to get the public on board

1027
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,599
in order to do so we need to dive into

1028
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,599
three categories we need the press to

1029
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,079
push

1030
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,159
for the public to become aware in other

1031
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,599
words we need to change the language and

1032
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:32,480
imagery

1033
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,320
of a hacker and start using the correct

1034
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,079
terms such as cyber criminal for those

1035
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,159
who commit unethical hacking

1036
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,679
although i really separate the two

1037
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,719
groups because we're very different

1038
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,800
we're not really in the same group we're

1039
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,800
two very different groups

1040
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,639
in order to help the press organizations

1041
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,119
need to be on board with bilateral trust

1042
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,719
and with having a vulnerability

1043
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,159
disclosure programs

1044
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,159
by showing these support hackers the

1045
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,000
public changes are being general

1046
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,760
and lastly to have organizations and

1047
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,520
public opinion to push and motivate

1048
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,280
capitol hill to get on board

1049
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,880
and update the current legislation that

1050
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,960
will protect ethical hackers

1051
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,079
overall we need all three of these

1052
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,760
to support hacker rights for it to

1053
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,920
become a reality

1054
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,200
so how do we get there well these are

1055
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,280
the five needs that we need to do

1056
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,480
and overall we need to push forward

1057
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,119
awareness and how we get there

1058
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:25,119
i'm gonna need you i'm gonna need your

1059
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,599
help to do that

1060
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,520
first things first there's a petition

1061
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,720
that is written

1062
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,599
um i wrote this at the end of february

1063
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,359
but basically it's broken down by

1064
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,839
this entire conversation so it's broken

1065
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,440
down by organizations

1066
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,880
by legislators by hackers and also for

1067
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,079
the media

1068
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,000
on what are the next steps that they can

1069
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,720
do and to take responsibility for

1070
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,560
anyone can sign this petition who

1071
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,079
believes that we deserve

1072
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,480
rights and i ask for you to sign and

1073
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,520
share it

1074
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,800
that is the link right there now the

1075
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,079
other thing that you can do

1076
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,280
is just go to hacking is not a crime.org

1077
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,320
once again hacking is not a crime.org

1078
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,000
you can find the petition in all the

1079
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,320
next steps of what to do

1080
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,079
for pushing for hacker rights but also

1081
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:13,520
how to get involved

1082
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,839
this is a one-stop shop for everyone in

1083
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,359
the hacker community and outside the

1084
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:18,400
hacker community

1085
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,480
to know what are the organizations that

1086
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,240
are supporting the hacker community in a

1087
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,119
good way

1088
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,640
when it comes to legislation and for to

1089
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,119
produce better recognition for hackers

1090
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,320
themselves and to change the

1091
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,440
representation of hackers in the media

1092
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,359
if you want to get involved to volunteer

1093
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,480
or advocate

1094
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,200
uh just please go to hackiness.crime.org

1095
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,720
there's a form you can fill out you just

1096
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,040
have to

1097
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,839
read to the tenants

1098
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,400
the other stuff that we need to do is

1099
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,520
talk to the press

1100
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,520
that means we need to let them know they

1101
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,720
have it wrong

1102
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,880
so if you ever see the press's article

1103
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,240
saying um

1104
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,359
the term hacker instead of criminal

1105
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,560
correct them send them a very polite and

1106
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,880
understanding text not text messages a

1107
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,760
dm

1108
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,960
or a response to their articles saying

1109
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,560
hi i came across your article and i

1110
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,560
i really like what you wrote there's one

1111
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,079
thing i want to let you know

1112
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,720
is that the term is actually not hacker

1113
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,119
it's

1114
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,320
criminal or attacker and the reason for

1115
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,000
that is that hackers are actually people

1116
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,119
that stay within scope

1117
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,359
and don't exploit we're the ones that

1118
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,520
are trying to

1119
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,079
protect you from the bad guys now

1120
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,599
another way how you can let the public

1121
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:32,880
know is also talking to your friends

1122
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,320
families and colleagues

1123
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,599
and letting them know that there's a

1124
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,599
difference between the hacker and

1125
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,640
also a an attacker and a good way how to

1126
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,119
do that

1127
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,079
is let them know think of a hacker as a

1128
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,200
locksmith

1129
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,880
and an attacker as a burglar

1130
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,720
this tends to make it easier for them to

1131
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,240
understand

1132
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,960
but it's not just the like the language

1133
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,320
being used we also need to make sure

1134
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,240
that they use the correct images so if

1135
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,040
you see them do an

1136
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,839
article of a dark coded figure please

1137
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:02,880
correct them on that

1138
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,320
let them know like that's not really

1139
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,920
what we look like

1140
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,800
at all oh and if you're ever talking to

1141
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,400
the press please don't wear a hacker

1142
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,920
like not a hacker uh don't wear a hoodie

1143
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,359
um because we're trying to change that

1144
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,800
stereotype and please definitely don't

1145
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,240
wear a skate mask i mean who wants to

1146
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,520
wear a skate mask

1147
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,480
anyway third step how to get involved is

1148
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,040
to

1149
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,720
push for organizations to partner and

1150
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,920
campaign with hacking is not a crime.org

1151
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,599
and the reason for that is that the more

1152
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,440
companies we have on board

1153
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,720
um to join us or organizations that want

1154
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,359
to join

1155
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,839
and bring rights and bring a voice to

1156
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,359
this hacker community

1157
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,680
the more stronger that we stand when it

1158
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,599
comes to trying to change legislation

1159
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,160
because legislators listen to companies

1160
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,760
but they also listen to people and

1161
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,280
people will listen to

1162
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,839
companies and legislators so there is

1163
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:52,960
like i said there's a

1164
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,200
public cycle which has to do with

1165
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,880
legislation

1166
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,160
um the media and also

1167
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,200
um organizations they all three play a

1168
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,400
role to bring about

1169
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,200
a better awareness also if you work for

1170
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:07,599
a

1171
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:08,960
organization that doesn't have a

1172
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,560
vulnerability disclosure program please

1173
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,560
check out disclose.io

1174
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,400
it's a really great organization that's

1175
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,760
trying to push for

1176
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,119
other uh companies to get on board

1177
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,560
there's a really easy template that you

1178
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,040
can use also anything you want to know

1179
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:23,839
about

1180
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,839
of how to have a vdp program or set up a

1181
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:28,480
disclosure

1182
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,640
it's all there and it's a great resource

1183
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,560
for you to have

1184
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,200
the first step is to contact your local

1185
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,560
representatives to update current

1186
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,599
legislation

1187
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,359
they need to hear stories from you they

1188
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,520
need to hear your story

1189
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,839
they need to understand that you are so

1190
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,640
deeply impacted by the current laws

1191
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,520
and ask for them to take a stand with us

1192
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,000
because

1193
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,160
this goes across party lines believe it

1194
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,240
or not this is not a democratic or

1195
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,520
republican issue

1196
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,400
this goes across all lines this is just

1197
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,440
a human right

1198
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,160
issue now the other thing to note about

1199
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,240
is that there is a van buren versus us

1200
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,079
case that's coming up

1201
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,640
be on top of that it is going to be

1202
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,680
voted on

1203
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,000
or not voted but it's going to be

1204
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,800
represented

1205
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,160
in the supreme court on november 30th

1206
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,839
so please keep an eye on that because

1207
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,520
it's really important for us to be aware

1208
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,960
of

1209
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,560
now you can also contact your

1210
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,000
legislators about it as well

1211
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,960
and i'm going to tell you a little bit

1212
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,200
about this case so basically what

1213
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,000
happened was

1214
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,560
that the a former georgia police officer

1215
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,160
was wrongly convicted under the

1216
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,599
notoriously vague

1217
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,319
cfa so remember the computer fraud abuse

1218
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:37,280
act

1219
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,319
um and basically what happened in this

1220
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,079
case is that nathan van buren was

1221
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,760
accused of taking money in exchange for

1222
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,280
looking up a license plate in a law

1223
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,960
enforcement database

1224
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,119
he was convicted of violence if hey

1225
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,960
because he allegedly used a database for

1226
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,800
an improper purpose

1227
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,720
even though it was a database that he

1228
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,680
was allowed to access for work purposes

1229
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,839
under this expansive interpretation of

1230
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,280
cfaa

1231
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,000
it would be a federal crime this is very

1232
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,680
important to understand

1233
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,480
at any time a person violates a website

1234
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,319
terms of services

1235
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:13,040
if violating the terms of services is a

1236
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,160
crime

1237
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,880
private companies now get to decide who

1238
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,400
goes to prison

1239
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,680
and for what putting us all at risk for

1240
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,119
everyday online behavior

1241
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,880
by following this case look at the

1242
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,920
briefs that have been submitted to it

1243
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,000
one of them is from votes and this one

1244
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,280
that you need to read

1245
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,079
because it will make you angry and it's

1246
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,000
okay to be angry because

1247
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,040
take that anger and take action

1248
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,839
by letting your legislators know they

1249
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,200
are completely

1250
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,800
wrong about this disclose io did

1251
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,920
uh release a letter um in response to

1252
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,720
votes uh

1253
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,079
brief submission and i have to admit i

1254
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,599
applaud them for that

1255
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,680
it is scary to think that they believe

1256
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,200
that security research

1257
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,319
is a criminal activity

1258
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:07,040
um when we need disclosure more than

1259
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,240
ever before

1260
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,760
especially the upcoming election

1261
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,599
the fifth step to get involved is to

1262
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,920
support organizations i keep dropping

1263
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,200
disclose.i o

1264
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,200
but there's so many other ones like i'm

1265
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,480
the calvary

1266
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,640
also cert coordination center known as

1267
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,520
cert cc

1268
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,640
eff cti league support them if you're in

1269
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,359
the us

1270
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,119
also take a look at csa they're trying

1271
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:30,640
to do whatever they can to try to

1272
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,440
support

1273
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,240
us as a hacker community so it's really

1274
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,079
important is to get involved

1275
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,800
volunteer ask how you can help and

1276
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,839
support them

1277
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,160
because as a community ourselves it's up

1278
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,440
to us to step up

1279
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,400
and help and support one another and so

1280
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,480
that is the one thing why hacking is not

1281
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,560
a crime.org is around

1282
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,319
is because we wanted everyone to know

1283
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,160
about these organizations and to know

1284
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,319
that they can support

1285
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:59,040
the hacker rights cause or movement by

1286
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,000
volunteering their time

1287
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,839
so the main takeaways over this entire

1288
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,440
talk is that overall we need to push for

1289
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,319
awareness for

1290
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,480
hackers to be able to have rights

1291
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,319
because right now we don't have rights

1292
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:11,440
and i probably should have said that at

1293
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,079
the very beginning

1294
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:13,359
but i think you figure it out but we

1295
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,359
don't have rights unfortunately

1296
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,599
but these are the five needs to get

1297
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:18,400
there

1298
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,520
the the main takeaways from everything

1299
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,720
you now know everything and i may need

1300
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,960
your advice and assistance of course so

1301
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,800
if you want to get involved once again

1302
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,400
check out happiness not

1303
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,440
crime.org but most importantly

1304
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,920
i just want to remind you that change

1305
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,119
really does start

1306
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:40,800
with you and me we cannot give

1307
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,960
up at this time we must continue to

1308
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,800
fight for our rights

1309
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,520
because that is what we need to do

1310
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,480
because we know

1311
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,119
people that have been impacted and

1312
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,000
ourselves

1313
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,319
have been impacted because of the

1314
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:55,599
public's perception

1315
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,800
of who we are and i think it's time

1316
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,000
for the public to know who we really are

1317
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
and that we are that every day here we

1318
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,920
are the people behind

1319
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,640
the screen that are protecting them from

1320
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,160
their information getting out there we

1321
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,000
are the ones that prevent breaches

1322
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,040
we're the ones that report bugs so then

1323
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,200
companies can fix it

1324
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,119
we are the ones that are doing whatever

1325
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:20,400
we can to protect

1326
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,599
people and i don't think society knows

1327
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:24,560
about that

1328
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,520
so until we can be more out there about

1329
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,319
that

1330
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,240
and to change the media's perception of

1331
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,359
who we are

1332
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,760
get legislators to understand us and

1333
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,520
take the time to understand us

1334
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,079
and take the time to listen because that

1335
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,839
is their job

1336
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:43,359
is to hear stories and to take action

1337
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:46,400
when necessary these are things that we

1338
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:46,880
can do

1339
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,800
at this very moment to change where we

1340
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,280
are today

1341
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,040
