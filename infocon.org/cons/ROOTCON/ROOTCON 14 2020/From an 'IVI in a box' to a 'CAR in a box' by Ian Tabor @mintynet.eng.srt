1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,000
good morning good afternoon good evening

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,599
i'm ian table

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,080
and i have actually previously been

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,920
asked to attend root con and bring my

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,559
pdo

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,680
car in a box however you'll see further

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,359
on in this presentation

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,199
logistically that would be impossible to

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,640
bring this to

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,400
the philippines however it is my honor

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,519
in presenting to you today my talk from

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,238
an iv in a box to a car in a box

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,559
which will show you how i built my car

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:35,760
in the box

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,440
hopefully sometime in the future when

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,440
the world gets back to normal

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,559
i will get out to the philippines um

18
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,440
if not i'm sure i'll come across um jay

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,600
at some point in the future

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,160
so where should we where should we begin

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,239
who am i well you could say i'm the

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,760
ultimate car hacker

23
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,440
um 15 years ago now um i built this

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,480
tiger super cat which is

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,240
a lotus 7s car you get in a kit

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,360
form it's based on the running gear of a

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,119
rear wheel drive 1990 sierra

28
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,680
has engine out of a 2004 ford focus

29
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,720
has about 170 ish horsepower

30
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,920
and um

31
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,479
weighs about 700 kilos so it goes pretty

32
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,280
quick

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,439
and it's fun to drive not exactly the

34
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,799
most practical thing in the world but

35
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,680
ho-hum

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,200
but it is completely different to the

37
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,600
car i hacked um

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,640
in that it only has three ecu's

39
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,880
of those three ecu's i built two of them

40
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,799
one of them is the mega square ecu which

41
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,960
controls the spark and engine

42
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,560
um ignit in injection on the engine

43
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,000
and the other is a little thing you can

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,159
see in the top right hand corner

45
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,280
which is a arduino mega based gps

46
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,520
data logger which actually does have

47
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,640
canvas on it

48
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,920
to read data from the mega square ecu

49
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,040
um so that is completely different to

50
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,159
what i hacked

51
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,200
there's a little disclaimer on the

52
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,800
bottom there if you are going to hack a

53
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,679
vehicle

54
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,080
you do it at your own risk the reason i

55
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,120
say this

56
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,520
is because previously i have actually

57
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,760
bricked my car

58
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,360
um two years ago now i've got a jet i

59
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,720
had a jag

60
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,120
um i was playing around with one of my

61
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,080
own built

62
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,760
um pieces of hardware plugged it into

63
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,280
the obd2 port

64
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,519
turned the ignition on it lit up like a

65
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:32,720
christmas tree

66
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,239
and then come up with the error message

67
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,560
can't find gearbox

68
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,599
which is fun okay so unplug the cable

69
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,400
turn it off

70
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,400
turn it back on still can't find gearbox

71
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,879
okay next step let's go and get the

72
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,160
diagnostic tool

73
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,760
um diagnostic tool said yep short on bus

74
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,640
couldn't reset the gearbox what do i do

75
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,920
next

76
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,760
so at that point it was get the spanner

77
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,360
out this got the battery

78
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,800
disconnected battery for about 30

79
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,400
seconds plugged it back in

80
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,800
got back in the car turned it on still

81
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,720
can't find gearbox

82
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,400
yeah at that point i was bet getting

83
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,760
very very worried

84
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,800
40 grand car not fun to ring them up say

85
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,000
it by the way i think i've broken the

86
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,879
car

87
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,040
um so the last thing was to disconnect

88
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,040
the battery for about 20 minutes

89
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,879
left it off for 20 minutes plugged it

90
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,319
back in

91
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,440
went back to it um got in turned it on

92
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,599
no error messages no lights found the

93
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,560
gearbox

94
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,440
started okay at the time it was about 11

95
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,280
o'clock at night so i didn't actually

96
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,879
want to go and drive anywhere

97
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,440
but next morning got in it went to pull

98
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,319
away

99
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,200
drove out the driveway where i live and

100
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,519
it forgotten how to change gear

101
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,080
because the jack that i had had the um

102
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,680
xc gearbox

103
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,840
um eight speed which learns your driving

104
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,519
style

105
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,920
it took me the vehicle three and a half

106
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,400
weeks to learn how to change gear again

107
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,439
properly to my normal driving cell

108
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,920
stupid thing was six weeks later i did

109
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,599
exactly the same thing

110
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,080
so um if you ever come across a car

111
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,080
hacker that hasn't breaked a car

112
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,200
they've even not been trying enough or

113
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,400
they're lying um

114
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,000
so on to my car packing history

115
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,079
um the car in question i will tell you

116
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,279
about in a second

117
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,240
um i wrote up how i did it how i hacked

118
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,560
it

119
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,680
and then i presented about that in

120
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,520
2018 at dc 4420 besides london rookie

121
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,240
track

122
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,240
and defcon 26 car hacking village

123
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,600
after that i was invited to

124
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,160
bug crowds live bug bash in 2018

125
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,199
which is probably where i first met jay

126
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,240
um from root con um because he works at

127
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,000
bug crowd

128
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,479
at that event myself and another couple

129
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,040
of people

130
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,639
found a major vulnerability in one of

131
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,240
the vehicles got

132
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,520
a payout of five figures between the

133
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,400
three of us

134
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,479
um which actually funded the car in the

135
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,520
box

136
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,880
um i then went back to the

137
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,479
bug bash in 2019 didn't quite find as

138
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,600
much there

139
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,759
um because they ruled my normal attack

140
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,360
vector out of scope

141
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,759
because anyone can attack the canvas

142
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,840
defcon 27 last year i did a bug crowd

143
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,080
car hacking panel with cyber gibbons and

144
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,520
spectres

145
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,759
um i also presented

146
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,240
hacker one at auto isaac on a car

147
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,120
hacking

148
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,400
vulnerability disclosure policy panel

149
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,960
um and for my sins now i run the car

150
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,280
hacking village in the uk

151
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,800
um 2019 we did quite a few events

152
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,120
i think i did about 14 in total

153
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,680
including the ones shown on screen there

154
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,240
2020 the plan was to do a bit of a

155
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,440
european tour

156
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,720
and then cove it happens um which just

157
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,080
meant i've actually done

158
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,560
some other global conferences which i

159
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,360
wouldn't have probably

160
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,639
done if i had been in real life but

161
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,400
i did miss out on going to dublin

162
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,880
stuttgart brussels

163
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,080
um london liverpool and still con

164
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,160
are all cancelled as well thank you very

165
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,360
much kovid

166
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,560
but better to be safe than sorry um so

167
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,759
i have actually done this talk at

168
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,280
quite a few conferences before but um

169
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,560
yep i've also been invited to go to

170
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,319
many many other conferences around the

171
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,479
world with my car in the box

172
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,360
for example ossetcon in australia a

173
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,039
conference over in brazil

174
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,919
nulcon in india i was asked to go to

175
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:44,560
egypt

176
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,680
to take it to b-sides

177
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,440
over there um but logistically it is a

178
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,039
bit of a nightmare

179
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,639
so onto the car in question in

180
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,680
2015 many many years ago now

181
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,120
i bought this um brand new

182
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,479
citroen ds5 1955 limited edition

183
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,560
it had all the bells and whistles all

184
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,520
the toys

185
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,400
absolutely everything including a seven

186
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:12,800
inch

187
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,080
touchscreen in the center of the

188
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,319
dashboard which

189
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,000
would allow you to surf the internet

190
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,759
from your vehicle

191
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,919
if you wanted to if you tethered over

192
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,120
wi-fi or bluetooth to your mobile phone

193
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,639
why you'd want to do it i don't know

194
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,639
because the ui is absolutely

195
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,319
useless and it's really slow browser but

196
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,280
the option was there while doing a bit

197
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,520
of traveling up and down the country

198
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,080
i got a bit bored one day and i decided

199
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,960
to run nmap

200
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,720
against my head unit while tethered to

201
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,400
it from my mobile phone

202
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,599
and found four ports available um

203
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,199
23 toenet um 111

204
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,840
which is nfs or rpc

205
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,000
um three three three three and twenty

206
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,520
thousand

207
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,440
uh i've subsequently been told that

208
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,879
twenty thousand is

209
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,080
um dmp3 which is an industrial control

210
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,120
system

211
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,080
um protocol which potentially will allow

212
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,759
direct access to the can bus

213
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,199
but trying to find someone that knows

214
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,720
how to actually craft the mp3 packet

215
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,319
to see whether it has direct access to

216
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,080
the can bus is getting a bit difficult

217
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,199
but i have

218
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,960
got some information but i've not

219
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,360
actually got around to using it yet

220
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,560
so it had telnet open so what did i do

221
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,080
tell it to the head unit what up next

222
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,279
full access to the file system so in the

223
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,320
center of console

224
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,919
there is a usb port um you can plug into

225
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,679
that usb port that will allow you to

226
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,040
copy files off

227
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,080
if you wish when you do

228
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,000
explore the file system and copy some

229
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,600
files off there are some sql like

230
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,800
databases

231
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,080
that include your gps history your phone

232
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,720
book

233
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,279
and your phone history thank you very

234
00:08:59,279 --> 00:08:59,760
much

235
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,120
personal data yep great

236
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,640
so um i found out this

237
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,399
and sort of parked it for a bit until i

238
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,080
decided to sell the vehicle

239
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,600
at the point i decided to celebrate if

240
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,120
it was fair game let's see what else i

241
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,240
can do

242
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,240
uh i then later found out by looking

243
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,600
through vxworks

244
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,120
command reference that you didn't

245
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,680
actually have to copy it to the usb port

246
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,760
what you could do was map a path to an

247
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,440
ftp server

248
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,800
and then copy your files one by one

249
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,680
from the head unit over wi-fi onto the

250
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,959
ftp server

251
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,440
wonderful great so i wrote my findings

252
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,080
up

253
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,000
sent it to peugeot citron and then we're

254
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,680
like well we don't get it

255
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,279
it's up to the user to secure their

256
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,519
wi-fi it's like i'm not saying the wi-fi

257
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:43,760
is

258
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,440
insecure i'm saying you shouldn't really

259
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,040
have telnet running

260
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,120
just like i still don't see the problem

261
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,320
but whatever

262
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,040
so pose the situation to them your

263
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,320
mobile phone's dead

264
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,920
you want to go to the cinema you want to

265
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,760
find out what time the things are on

266
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,600
so you pull your car into mcdonald's car

267
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,880
park

268
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,200
um tether onto mcdonald's car park while

269
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,480
you're in there

270
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,240
some other scrote in mcdonald's car park

271
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,079
and then run an map across the um

272
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,200
wireless lan find port 23 open if they

273
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,399
know what they're doing they can then

274
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,240
find the files copy them off

275
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,720
and now know where you live um you're

276
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,680
away from home

277
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,079
and i can go rob you never like that's a

278
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,600
bad idea

279
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,839
i know what we'll do the suggestion is

280
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,760
disable wi-fi

281
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,120
uh which is wonderful however the same

282
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,839
hack is

283
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,839
available over the bluetooth personal

284
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,440
area network stack

285
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,320
um the only saving grace on the actual

286
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,440
device is

287
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,040
that every time you switch the vehicle

288
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,600
on you have to manually go in and say

289
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,640
tether either over wi-fi or bluetooth it

290
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,000
didn't do it automatically

291
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,920
i'm sure there must be a way to make it

292
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,920
automatically but i haven't worked out

293
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,120
to do it yet

294
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,079
um i did point out to the um persian

295
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:58,640
citroen

296
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,720
that the french president gets driven

297
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,320
around in one of these vehicles

298
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,360
very similar and it might be a matter of

299
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,839
french national security and they

300
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:08,560
laughed at me

301
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,839
it was like yeah great wonderful okay

302
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,880
so i sold the car

303
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,040
and i thought we can still do something

304
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,240
with this i

305
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,399
will what i'll do is i'll go and buy a

306
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,240
hedge unit from the scrapyard

307
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,320
so i went on ebay found a head unit off

308
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,000
a ds3

309
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,480
um went up to the scrap yard went to

310
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,279
collect it

311
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,959
and had to pay for it and i asked could

312
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,320
i have the cables

313
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,240
at that point they went well it's going

314
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,320
in the ds3 you don't need the cables

315
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,000
it's like no it's actually going in my

316
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,120
kit car

317
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,480
couldn't explain to them i was going to

318
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,399
hack it but um

319
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,560
so they reluctantly got me the cables

320
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,920
that require

321
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,200
that were needed to connect it all

322
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,880
together and connected to the outside

323
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,920
world one of them

324
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,600
wasn't actually from the same vehicle

325
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,200
but it fits and it would work

326
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,920
but at that point they then said no

327
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,720
warranty

328
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,079
you can't bring it back because you're

329
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,920
not putting in the original car

330
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,160
and you'll never get it working so

331
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,800
challenge accepted

332
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,880
as you can see on the screen here you

333
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,519
have quite a few parts of

334
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,600
what would normally be either on or

335
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,120
under the dashboard

336
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,720
um to get the hedge unit working outside

337
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,560
of the car you can't just put 12 volts

338
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,480
on it anymore and

339
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,040
flick a switch what you need is a can

340
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,240
bus message to say

341
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,000
wake up actually you need quite a few

342
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,399
canvas messages to say wake up

343
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,160
but um so i had to then purchase

344
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,639
the under dash wiring loom the ignition

345
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:39,920
key

346
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,399
the body control module and the engine

347
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,600
ecu

348
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,040
um together because they are coded um

349
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,480
because i was planning potentially to

350
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,240
build a car in the box

351
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,800
in the future um those are the only bits

352
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,600
that actually need to be coded together

353
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,639
um you then need these steering column

354
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,760
switches

355
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,279
the instrument cluster some other

356
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,320
switches and a nice 12-volt power supply

357
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,160
plug it all together and you get the

358
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,440
head unit working

359
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,320
wonderful at that point i probably spent

360
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,000
about 500 pound

361
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,120
um so the challenge was

362
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,600
could i get the head unit working

363
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,720
without the rest of the

364
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,760
bits that are shown there so i did

365
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,839
uh got this got my old arduino with the

366
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,040
can shield out

367
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,320
did some sniffing did some replay

368
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,519
managed to find out that um

369
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,800
there are five messages that are

370
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,480
required to tell the head unit to come

371
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,279
on

372
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,360
so at that point i then got myself a

373
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,720
nice little case

374
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,760
put the head unit in the case and

375
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,000
then i can then take that to conferences

376
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,959
and show people

377
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,040
this is how i hack my head unit this is

378
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,480
how you do it

379
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,399
you can do it too if you really want to

380
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,760
and you can see if you can go any

381
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,680
further

382
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,600
you probably can't see it but on top of

383
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,440
the head unit here

384
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,920
there is the wi-fi symbol that says it

385
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,560
is

386
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,839
it contains wi-fi yes it did when i

387
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,040
first bought it

388
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,920
problem was someone had disabled it

389
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,800
somewhere

390
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,639
so it wasn't actually working so you

391
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,760
could only do the hack over bluetooth

392
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,760
hack over the bluetooth is slightly more

393
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,120
involved because you have to do

394
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,399
personality network

395
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,320
and it's a pain however i did find a

396
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,079
strange russian website that actually

397
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,279
tells you how to play with the sql like

398
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,920
files and modify the settings inside the

399
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,160
head unit to allow the wi-fi to work

400
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,440
and as you can see there um the wi-fi is

401
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,160
now available

402
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,720
as well as the bluetooth all these other

403
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,480
components were actually from a peugeot

404
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,519
208

405
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,240
not a ds3 they're made by the same

406
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,440
manufacturer

407
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,519
they are sort of the same vehicle but

408
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,720
not quite

409
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,920
the ds3 is actually based on

410
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,360
a peugeot 207 uh infrastructure i

411
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,000
believe

412
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,399
and not applied to eight but it's the

413
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,360
same head you

414
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,079
head unit was sold across the range in

415
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,000
those other vehicles as well

416
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,279
so after coming back from the um

417
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,360
bug bash with that nice share of the

418
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,839
five figure sum

419
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,560
um there i had some money spare

420
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,800
i was off work at the time so i decided

421
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,639
to build a car in a box

422
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,199
or a car on a bench to start with um

423
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,399
here is the inspiration

424
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,880
which is grim cyber's 3po you've

425
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,639
probably seen it at defcon

426
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,600
or on some of the videos from defcon it

427
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,000
is

428
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,240
all of the works all of the electronics

429
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,800
from a 2012 ford focus

430
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,880
however there is a cavet it doesn't

431
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,199
think it's a fully working car

432
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,279
my plan is to make it think it's a fully

433
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,560
working car

434
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,720
engine rotates the wheels rotate and all

435
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,959
of the dials actually will work

436
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,279
they do i'll come on to that so

437
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,440
at that point it was a case of let's get

438
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,279
all the other bits that make it think

439
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,320
it's a car

440
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,720
so we have on this screen here the

441
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,000
steering rack ecu

442
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,320
and steering rack um that's because it's

443
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,680
got electronic power steering

444
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,680
so it will need a canvas message to tell

445
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,160
it to turn the power steering on

446
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,079
potentially some of these vehicles would

447
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,880
actually do actually have

448
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,399
um park assist so the steering can

449
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,160
actually operate itself

450
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,079
not worked out those messages yet what i

451
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,079
want to do is find one with park assist

452
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,880
and then record what happens while it's

453
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,720
parking to see whether actually

454
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,759
i can actually get my car in the box to

455
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,040
do the same thing

456
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,759
so you've also got the throttle body the

457
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,959
main fuse box

458
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,759
which also potentially has an ecu in it

459
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,600
engine ecu i already had

460
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,120
abs ecu i had to purchase none of these

461
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,639
parts

462
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,120
extra parts act had to come from a

463
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,480
specific vehicle

464
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,079
because they're not really coded to the

465
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,479
vehicle

466
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,279
in the they won't they will still work

467
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,360
even though from a different vehicle

468
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,440
um there are some things you may have to

469
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,959
change in the body control module to

470
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:01,680
tell it which

471
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,079
version of the power steering but i

472
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,160
didn't have too many problems

473
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,000
um okay in the top right we've got the

474
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,199
instrument cluster and the steering

475
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,959
switch cluster

476
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,720
bottom right you've got a laptop that's

477
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,160
powered by steam i think

478
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,880
um which runs the peugeot diagnostic

479
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,000
software

480
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,319
and when i first plugged all this in

481
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,439
together

482
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,640
i think that was three and a half

483
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,839
thousand error messages

484
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,000
from missing ecu's

485
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,160
missing codes missing sensors and

486
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,760
absolutely everything

487
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,799
yeah it was fun um i still think i'm i

488
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,160
think i've still got about

489
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,600
50 um errors on the vehicle

490
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,240
but ho-hum it's never gonna go down the

491
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,039
road again

492
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,200
it's not even a vehicle it was purchased

493
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,559
from

494
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,600
parts from ebay et cetera so

495
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,120
um if you want to make a car

496
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,960
in a box you don't need the wiring

497
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,160
diagram

498
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,360
this is the warrantogram for the ecu

499
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,720
for my mega squirt um as you can see

500
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,480
it's a db37 which has 37 pins

501
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,600
26 in use six a ground

502
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,360
it's not exactly a complicated engine

503
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,760
because it's batch injection wasted

504
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,880
spark

505
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,240
single o2 sensor coolant sensor

506
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,760
um air temperature sensor fuel pump

507
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,360
uh crank sensor uh fuel railway etc

508
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,039
but it's not exactly anything um

509
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,840
to mickey mouse but that is nothing

510
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,280
compared to

511
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,559
if you have a look at the wiring diagram

512
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,919
for the persia tour eight the project

513
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,120
tour eight in question

514
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,280
is a one liter three cylinder

515
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,559
with sequential injection

516
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,559
sequential ignition dual verbal valve

517
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,640
timing so it's got two solenoids and two

518
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:58,960
cents

519
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,000
two cam sensors it's got dual o2 sensors

520
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,679
it's got temperature sensors got maf

521
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,600
sensor it's got

522
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
absolutely everything you can probably

523
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,039
even think about

524
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,720
um there are three connectors on the ecu

525
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,720
two fifty three-way connectors and a

526
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,880
32-in way connector

527
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,679
so there's 138 possible pins

528
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,679
not all of them used but it does get a

529
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:24,960
bit busy

530
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,280
um one of the one of the looms i

531
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,440
actually had to build myself

532
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,000
um the other two one came from the

533
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,160
inside of the car one came from

534
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,840
under the bonnet um

535
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,840
but you can get the connectors and

536
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,840
they're not cheap and you have to buy

537
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,280
the connector the shielding that goes on

538
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,000
top

539
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,960
the pins the correct tool to crimp the

540
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,760
pins

541
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,360
because they're a pain um but yeah

542
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,080
so first things first when making a car

543
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,240
think it's the engine's working

544
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,080
is you gotta make think the engine is

545
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,520
working so

546
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,919
to actually fall the engine ecu you need

547
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,559
crank and cam signals

548
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,480
um if you know anything about the

549
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,320
peugeot engine it

550
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,960
has a 60-2 sensor on the back of the

551
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,080
crankshaft

552
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,679
somewhere i think it's on the back of

553
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,200
the flow um

554
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,840
in which there's 60 holes in the

555
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,400
flywheel equally spaced and there are

556
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,960
two missing holes

557
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,559
so 58 holes but yeah um in a certain

558
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,840
space so it knows where it is in the

559
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,880
cycle

560
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,960
because it has dual variable valve

561
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,960
timing there is also two

562
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,000
cam sensors one of which

563
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,200
is pointing here and one of which is

564
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,559
pointing here

565
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,320
as you can see there is a profile on the

566
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,320
end of that cam and that cam

567
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,720
that are very similar but slightly out

568
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,919
of phase

569
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,520
um so what i had to do

570
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,120
was work out what that would look like

571
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,799
in a graph

572
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,880
and then i had to find a bit of software

573
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,400
that could actually simulate these

574
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,080
signals

575
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,480
um so i found a bit of software called

576
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,760
argustim

577
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,840
which you can program an arduino nano

578
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,919
uno or anything like that

579
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,200
and it will generate the signal um

580
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,360
d0 here is the crank sensor

581
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,520
d1 is the inlet sensor d2 is the exhaust

582
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,320
cam sensor the board in the bottom round

583
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,120
corner there

584
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,120
is the populated board i have

585
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,799
subsequently made

586
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,880
to allow you to um spoof those signals

587
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,159
on an ecu if you would like one

588
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,880
message be somehow and i will send you

589
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,200
them

590
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,640
i've got loads at the moment um

591
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,640
if you want to try and do that it will

592
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,120
work there are both surface mount

593
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,360
and through hole for the small trans

594
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,480
transistors

595
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,880
and resistors but there's also a massive

596
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,320
um

597
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,520
transistor in there for the other other

598
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,240
abs

599
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,720
simulator that i have built um

600
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,039
so that

601
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:17,120
is that um the next sensor you would

602
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:17,520
like

603
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,280
hello like to fall is the lambda sensor

604
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,600
um the lambda sensor detects how much

605
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,960
burnt or unburnt fuel

606
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,000
is in the exhaust

607
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,960
this vehicle has two of them what

608
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,760
happens is

609
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,280
there is a ac wave on a dc offset

610
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,760
that basically floats between going lean

611
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,640
going rich

612
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,720
and this 555 timer circuit on the screen

613
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,520
here

614
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,840
is the one i used and it doesn't work

615
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,039
and it clears the

616
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,320
um errors on the dashboard so the landed

617
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
sensor is not working

618
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,159
however there's two parts to a lambda

619
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,440
sensor

620
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,919
the other part of a lambda sensor is the

621
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,280
heater circuit

622
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,760
which would normally draw about an amp

623
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,559
so

624
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,600
what you have to do is wire up a

625
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,440
massive 50 ish resistor

626
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,000
across the heater circuit both heater

627
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,360
circuits and

628
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,880
i have done that and they're on the back

629
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,640
of my car in the box and every time i

630
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,520
have this

631
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,280
um do this presentation in real life i

632
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,200
always say oh people stay away from them

633
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,880
they get pretty hot and someone

634
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,320
at the end of the day will come over to

635
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,720
me and go yes they do get pretty hot

636
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,559
but yeah great whoops shouldn't really

637
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,480
be touching it

638
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,159
um some of the other sensors i had to

639
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,799
fall were the

640
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,600
fuel gauge that was done by using a

641
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,960
potentiometer

642
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,880
the coolant temperature sensor was also

643
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,159
done by using a temp

644
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,400
um potentiometer um

645
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,000
the final one of the things that was

646
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,240
simulated within the car in the box is

647
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,559
the abs and wheel speed simulator

648
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,120
um this was actually quite hard i tried

649
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,559
originally to do it

650
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,600
with just logic and not actually have to

651
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,000
have

652
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
a spinning motor but um when i probe the

653
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,880
signal

654
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,120
on my oscilloscope for the wheel speed

655
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,240
sensor

656
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,400
it's varying amplitude and varying

657
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
frequency depending on how fast this

658
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,520
wheels going around and it's not that

659
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,000
easy to

660
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,120
do so i cheated and i've

661
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,440
in the middle of this box here there is

662
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,360
a large motor

663
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,760
which is probably a bit too large but

664
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,240
that is attached to a shaft

665
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,480
on that shaft is a plastic disc around

666
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,320
that plastic disc is the reluctant wheel

667
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,679
that would normally be on your

668
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,320
axle on one of the four corners of your

669
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,679
vehicle

670
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,120
around that reluctor wheel um

671
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,320
you can see there are four sensors you

672
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,400
only actually need two of them

673
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,440
but i put i put all four in because why

674
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:51,919
not

675
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,240
um it gives me a bit of redundancy when

676
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,600
i only had two

677
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,679
if one of them went wrong you then have

678
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,120
to get the steam powered laptop out

679
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,720
which i didn't always take with me to

680
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,760
conferences

681
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,240
and that would mean you couldn't

682
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,760
actually use it

683
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,679
um as you can see there is another

684
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,360
potentiometer on here

685
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,279
that variable that varies the speed

686
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,120
off the motor by using pulse width

687
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,400
modulation

688
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,200
which then spins the product wheel

689
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,520
faster in front of the sensors

690
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,039
but then um

691
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,720
there is a can bus adapter on here which

692
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,720
then reads from the can bus

693
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,440
the speedo speed and then tries to match

694
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,200
what you want the speed to be

695
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,960
to what the actual speed is on the

696
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,240
speedo

697
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,919
um it's very very very very interesting

698
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,760
because what happens is when you have it

699
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,840
trying to match the speed it will go

700
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,840
flying past it because of inertia

701
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,679
and then it will realize oh no i've got

702
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,440
to slow down then it will go flying past

703
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,480
it in the other direction

704
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,559
and then realize it has to speed up and

705
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,080
then it will eventually settle down

706
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,440
and get vaguely near the speed you

707
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,760
actually want it however

708
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,440
it makes a very very strange winding

709
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,799
noise but you'll

710
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,960
see that in a minute with one of the

711
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,159
videos

712
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,240
um so

713
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,640
on to the can bus networks within the

714
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,600
car in the box

715
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,039
there are actually four can bus networks

716
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:21,360
um this is the same as if it was in pdo

717
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,440
the reason why it's called pdo is p for

718
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,559
peugeot and

719
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,760
d o is 208 in hex

720
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,120
um so your normal obd2 port is in the

721
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,679
bottom

722
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,760
left hand corner here um there is a

723
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,760
can bus high speed can bus that goes

724
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,320
from there to the body control module

725
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,720
the main fuse box abs esp

726
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,120
um ecu power steering

727
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,279
uh and engine ecu so that's all 500k

728
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:58,240
and um that you should be able to use

729
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,880
through the obd2 port the body control

730
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,799
module does actually work as a sort of

731
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,960
gateway so you've not got direct access

732
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,600
to those

733
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,960
other ecu's and because it's not sold

734
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,799
into the american market it doesn't

735
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,440
conform to any of the uds standards

736
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,559
so you can send the request for

737
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,279
uds of any variable you like and it will

738
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,799
completely ignore it

739
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,799
which is great when someone's doing

740
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,399
virtual hacking

741
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,559
and they try to do it and then don't

742
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,480
realize and you try and tell them

743
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,399
they won't work and they say go away um

744
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,880
there is a second can bus here in yellow

745
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,760
and green

746
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,520
that's a low speed 125k canvas that one

747
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,919
is for the it goes from body control

748
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:42,720
module

749
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,559
again gateway um to steering control ecu

750
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,440
and the airbag ecu i have not included

751
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,640
the airbag ecu

752
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,720
in the car in a box because i don't

753
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,720
really want someone playing around

754
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,240
and setting an airbag off in in

755
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,080
a conference and then having to fill a

756
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,840
form in

757
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,640
um potentially i could put the airbag

758
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,760
ecu in

759
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,760
and you could actually then play around

760
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,039
with that

761
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,799
at the end here there is an additional

762
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,159
obd2 port

763
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,679
um that is so that you can interact with

764
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:16,559
that bus

765
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,000
without actually having to

766
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,000
just makes it easier to show people

767
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,640
hacks and things

768
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,679
the third bus in blue and other blue

769
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,279
goes from body control module the

770
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,679
instrument cluster the matrix within the

771
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:32,799
instrument cluster

772
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,320
which is actually a completely separate

773
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,799
ecu that's the ones that shows

774
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,880
you your gps arrows and things and

775
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,760
speeds and things when you're using gps

776
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,399
um

777
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,279
it also goes to the ivi i have

778
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,120
subsequently installed

779
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,080
into the car in the box but not quite

780
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,200
got it working

781
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,480
a um rear parking sensor

782
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,000
i'm still working on that one so that's

783
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,399
not actually on the picture just yet

784
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,279
um again this second low speed bus has

785
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,640
an extra obd2 port at the end so you can

786
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,640
um interact with that bus and make it do

787
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,120
silly things like disco mode

788
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,039
and the final fourth can bus it's

789
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,360
actually between the ivi screen

790
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,399
and the ivi itself um i believe that's

791
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,840
for the touch screen

792
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,559
um why invent something different why

793
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,480
not just use can

794
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,520
not really have to play with those

795
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,159
messages because the cable only goes

796
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,840
between those two points and doesn't go

797
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,039
anywhere else

798
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,080
so i really played with that

799
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,840
but yes so here is my car in the box

800
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,640
in stay at home mode which is pretty

801
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,520
much how it's been

802
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,760
all year this year apart from some of

803
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,960
the online cons where i've had it

804
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,640
available remotely

805
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,480
and yes that is bigger in you on the

806
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,679
left

807
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,640
um here is my car in the box in the boot

808
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,159
of my girl

809
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,080
this is the slightly bigger rav4 that i

810
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,480
have the actual corner box was designed

811
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,039
to go

812
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,399
in the tail gate of my

813
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,279
jaguar xp that i had in that it was the

814
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,039
only thing that would fit in the boot

815
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,000
and that's about it when purchasing this

816
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,559
car i

817
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,440
actually had to actually take a tape

818
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:13,840
measure

819
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,399
with me just to make sure this would

820
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,320
actually fit in the boot without having

821
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,399
to have the seat down

822
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,640
fun yes so um next two pictures

823
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,840
are the abs simulator on the left and

824
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,600
the hedging in the box on the right

825
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,679
again you can see the little wi-fi logo

826
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:32,799
just here that says

827
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,520
it's got wi-fi at this point in time the

828
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,279
wi-fi wasn't actually working

829
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,960
but i've now subsequently got it working

830
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,720
um here is the car in the box itself um

831
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,399
most of the main controls are on the

832
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,320
right most of the big ecu's

833
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,039
on the left so you have your steering

834
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,480
controls your ignition

835
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,279
key which actually does work so you have

836
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,360
to crank it to get the engine ecu

837
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,159
to start and the simulators start

838
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,279
working

839
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:04,480
there is a little fuel pump

840
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,600
potentiometer there there's the

841
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,000
rear windscreen washer original plan for

842
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,200
that was to have a whiskey bottle

843
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,799
attached to it and if you could get it

844
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,799
to spit out whiskey on the front or the

845
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:15,760
windscreen

846
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,240
you got to drink what came out of it

847
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,000
minor problem with that alcohol cars is

848
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,960
frowned upon

849
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,240
and the other minor problem is every

850
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,559
time you press that button it does about

851
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:25,519
half a liter

852
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,960
so it would get very expensive very

853
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,559
quickly to actually put some decent

854
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,760
whisk in there

855
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,480
and someone will get very drunk um the

856
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,120
plan was

857
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,880
if you could get the whiskey out

858
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,960
without pressing the button you got to

859
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,159
drink it

860
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,880
um there's the two additional obd2 ports

861
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,200
on the left hand side we've got the body

862
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,640
control module at the bottom with lots

863
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,320
of cables coming out of it

864
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,559
um steering rack which does actually get

865
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,000
slightly lighter when you actually turn

866
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,880
the thing on

867
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,880
you can actually rotate it and move this

868
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,399
back left to right

869
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,799
left hand side there's the abs ecu in

870
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,799
the middle is the main fuse box and a

871
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,320
loaded cable underneath it because i

872
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,159
didn't want to shorten it

873
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,200
um this little blue box on the left is

874
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,960
the rg stim device

875
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,559
there is some switches on the top that

876
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,200
can actually disable the crank and cam

877
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,320
sensors

878
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,080
and don't normally use them that often

879
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,600
but the little dial there will actually

880
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,360
allow you to vary the

881
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,880
revs on the engine ecu above that is a

882
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,559
piece of trunking that has some leds in

883
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,760
the bottom leds show the

884
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,080
indication of the injectors firing the

885
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,840
top leds show the indication of the

886
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,480
coils firing for the spark plugs

887
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,679
at the top of that said piece of

888
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,000
trunking there is the variable resistor

889
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,919
that actually controls

890
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,600
the coolant temperature gauge on the

891
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,559
dashboard

892
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,799
so if you play with it it does actually

893
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:53,919
go up and down

894
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,519
very very slowly um top left hand corner

895
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,240
there is the

896
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,600
throttle body when you plug the thing in

897
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,440
it will actually work so when you push

898
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,039
on the accelerator the throttle body

899
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,320
will open

900
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,840
um accordingly it is drive by wire so

901
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,840
there are situations where if the revs

902
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,679
are really high and you try and floor it

903
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,799
it will not open the um throttle body

904
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,960
basically because there's no sensor

905
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,279
coming off the map sensor

906
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,240
um so that little blue box next to that

907
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,000
is the o2 simulator

908
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,679
i'm using the two five five five

909
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,559
circuits behind the back of the board

910
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:30,960
there

911
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,919
is the two heater circuits there's the

912
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,440
engine ecu with a couple of

913
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,760
um oil pressure and water temperature

914
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,960
sensors

915
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,880
you've then got the clutch and brake

916
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,720
switches because they are used for

917
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,760
the clutch which is used to disable the

918
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,840
cruise control and

919
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,600
detect gear change etc and the brake

920
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,279
switch is used

921
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:03,360
for the flashing brakes etc

922
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,360
but here you can see it's actually cable

923
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,279
tied down because i've put a switch in

924
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,440
parallel with it next to it here

925
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,440
there is a white better board here that

926
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,560
is actually yes

927
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,879
a cutting board with some holes drilled

928
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:15,679
in the back

929
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:20,000
and some suitably colored leds behind to

930
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,639
actually show

931
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,119
the indicators front and rear of the

932
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,079
vehicle

933
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,440
i'll show you that in a second

934
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,359
underneath there is some

935
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,520
very large resistors they are there for

936
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,560
the purposes of

937
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,679
folding the ecu in thinking

938
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,280
the bulbs are incandescent not leds

939
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,359
um because if you don't they'll flash

940
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,119
fast because it thinks one of the bulbs

941
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,480
are dead

942
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,320
so on to a little video

943
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,679
here is a little video of the

944
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,440
ref counter going up and down which is

945
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,800
the argus in being tweaked

946
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,480
um now

947
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,800
you can hear the winding of the abs

948
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,280
simulator motor

949
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,040
it's getting slightly faster it's doing

950
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,040
70 mile an hour but don't know where

951
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,280
it's doing 90 miler it's now doing 143

952
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,480
mile an hour

953
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,119
um if you've ever been a perjury toy i

954
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,119
don't think you'd ever get it 143 mile

955
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,640
an hour it would have routed itself to

956
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,079
bits first

957
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,040
but um that shows you how you can play

958
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,680
with the

959
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,880
um ecu simulators and affect what's

960
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,720
happening

961
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,160
um on to the next slide

962
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,079
um this here is the nano camera adapter

963
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:38,800
um

964
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,160
i made this in 2018 as my business card

965
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,839
um just to get people in

966
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,280
to remembering who i am really

967
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,359
um but it's actually a pcb that will

968
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,560
allow you to build a

969
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,240
cheap probably sub five dollar

970
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,599
can adapter um so you can get into some

971
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,200
basic car hacking

972
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,800
um on one side is the arduino nano um

973
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,480
this one here is a chinese clone the

974
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,640
serial electronics rubbish

975
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,760
so it doesn't always work but it

976
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,359
does enough to actually make it work

977
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,079
on the other side there is an mcp2515

978
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:20,960
module

979
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,560
um once you solder it all together

980
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,800
um you get yourself a little can adapter

981
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,320
you can then plug that into your car

982
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,880
and listen to what's going on the

983
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,720
default sketch i would suggest you

984
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,680
install is the one that says listen all

985
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,640
this basically

986
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,520
is a dump of what the car is producing

987
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,839
out with that basic sketch here is it

988
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,040
shown in the

989
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,079
arduino serial monitor

990
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,200
here is shown in putty

991
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,359
using again the serial monitor in potty

992
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:59,599
um details of github is there

993
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,119
there is a second slightly smaller

994
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,640
adapter i have made

995
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,839
called the tiny can adapter that is a uk

996
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:09,280
pound one pound coin um for scale

997
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,839
and that little adapter there uses the

998
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,560
new 80 tiny 1614

999
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,560
which is actually the chip on the left

1000
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,240
not the chip in the middle

1001
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,320
um with a mcp2515 module

1002
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,960
and a sn65 hvd-230

1003
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,839
can transceiver so it's a slightly

1004
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,320
smaller version of the nanocan

1005
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,000
um there are two flavors of this there

1006
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,400
are actually three favors of this now

1007
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,720
um this is the one that can be used for

1008
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,920
surreptitious

1009
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,640
funny stuff you program it with um

1010
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,160
certain messages that if it's

1011
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,839
a certain sequence so if it sees a

1012
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,280
certain message it will set off a

1013
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,880
certain sequence

1014
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,800
um and you can play with people's cars

1015
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,320
without them knowing

1016
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,520
it's actually there um all a bit of fun

1017
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,720
but you could scare someone with it

1018
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,119
and this is the alternative version and

1019
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,320
if you notice there's a slightly

1020
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,040
different board

1021
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,000
um color board in the back which is

1022
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,560
green

1023
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,720
not blue this one allows you to plug in

1024
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,240
um the usb to serial adapter

1025
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,200
which then means you can run a serial

1026
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,800
line can

1027
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,240
and socket can on an xbox these are

1028
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,160
actually powered from the obd2 port as

1029
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,200
well

1030
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,359
um i haven't got around to putting these

1031
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:32,880
on and putting the

1032
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,400
soft software and or hardware on

1033
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,640
github yet but it's one of the things

1034
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,000
i've got to do

1035
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
probably over the christmas break this

1036
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,320
year i'll do it at some point

1037
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,119
um but i have actually built another

1038
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,880
version of the tiny can adapter which

1039
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,800
will actually go inside the shell

1040
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,920
of a obd2 plug um

1041
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,400
but i've not got any pictures of that in

1042
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,240
this presentation

1043
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,078
so next um

1044
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,079
here is a video of what i call disco

1045
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,640
mode this is using the tiny can

1046
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,599
to squirt in messages on the same bus as

1047
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,680
the steering controller

1048
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,119
um the steering switch controller to

1049
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,000
make it go into disco mode um that would

1050
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,920
actually affect both the inside and the

1051
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,440
outside of the car

1052
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,560
i have another nano can configured on

1053
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,280
the other

1054
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,560
can bus which just does disco dash

1055
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,320
doesn't affect any of the outside of the

1056
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,400
car but makes the dashboard light up

1057
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,520
like a christmas tree

1058
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,800
and have an epileptic fit so

1059
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,800
um yeah they can be used to play so

1060
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,760
um that's me done um i'd like to say

1061
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,640
thanks to

1062
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,240
the grim cyber team because they were

1063
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,839
the inspiration and they did actually

1064
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,520
help me quite a bit in getting some of

1065
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,480
the

1066
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,480
things ironed out like recommendations

1067
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,760
for power supplies

1068
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,320
um etc they'll name their i'm not going

1069
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:56,960
to name them

1070
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,560

1071

um i'd also like to thank the root con

1072
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,520
team for allowing me to

1073
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,400
actually talk today i will be in

1074
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,359
discord or

1075
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,040
whichever platform we are using to do

1076
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,839
questions

1077
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,960
after this talk if you have any issue

1078
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,800
of issues and you want to get in contact

1079
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,960
with me my contact details are down the

1080
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,920
bottom there

1081
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,359
um as long as as long as you're not

1082
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,720
asking me to help you with something

1083
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,440
illegal i will assist

1084
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,079
it's amazing how many people are dumb

1085
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,200
and try to actually

1086
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,560
get you to help them with something

1087
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,720
dodgy um

1088
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,240
it's not worth it but i will if anyone

1089
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,760
gets in contact and wants a nano can pcb

1090
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,760
just ask i will put them in a post it

1091
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,520
will cost you the postage

1092
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,119
i don't make any money out of it but

1093
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,280
it's just me helping

1094
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,640
others get into car hacking um

1095
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,640
if you want some of the other obscure

1096
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,920
pcbs i've had

1097
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,440
if you see them online etc again ask

1098
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,319
because i i've got loads i always order

1099
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:10,800
um

1100
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,839
panelized so i get too many so i will

1101
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,280
send them out

1102
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,000
to help others but that is me done for

1103
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,640
