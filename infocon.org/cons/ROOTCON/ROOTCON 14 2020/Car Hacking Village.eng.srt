this is your very own intro to car

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,640
hacking village ph

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,280
101 it's some sort of an introduction to

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,239
what car hacking village ph or car

13
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,480
hacking village is which

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,600
started in root con 13. so

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,879
uh it will be jammy or eminon and i

16
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,000
ship code they'll be uh talking

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,879
more about the village that we have here

18
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,440
in the philippines

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,078
so what is scar hacking village ph

20
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,159
car hacking village ph or philippines or

21
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,000
rutgen chv

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,479
is blessed by the elders of the main chv

23
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,320
or carthage village community

24
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,680
and as what you can see we we were

25
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,439
acknowledged there in the about page

26
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,520
and i'm sorry for the roosters that you

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,799
can hear right now

28
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,360
they're always in my background in other

29
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,280
countries as well in other virtual

30
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,479
hacking conferences uh they're uh

31
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,360
they meet more yeah they made an

32
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,200
appearance in bug crowd level up

33
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,600
uh in hit call no in some

34
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,640
indian hacking conference as well

35
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,159
so uh this was launched in 2019

36
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,720
and appeared for the first time in

37
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,280
rootcon

38
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,720
13. so that this was last year

39
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,200
and then with root cause recovery mode

40
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,880
activated

41
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,799
chv ph will be conducting workshops

42
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,560
uh and will be giving talks about

43
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,399
automotive security

44
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,560
and basic diagnostics this year so um

45
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,760
it's more about tips and tricks on how

46
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,959
to fix

47
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,120
or how to um tweak your car

48
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,239
and also how to create your own bench

49
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,120
for car hacking

50
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,200
the primary goal of the car hacking

51
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,360
village is to build a community around

52
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:37,120
discovering weaknesses and

53
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,480
huh sorry i think we've

54
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,760
missed jay for a while

55
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,040
jay are you there you're you're odd

56
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,519
yourself

57
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,440
i think jay is on mute

58
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,920
anyway just checking uh if it's my

59
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,800
connection or

60
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,280
jace i know someone someone someone

61
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,319
unmuted me

62
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,159
during my talk oh someone get to mute

63
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:16,560
you

64
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,599
while you're talking all right anyways

65
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,280
let's get back to it so yeah we're

66
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,760
we're actually on the primary goal of

67
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,440
car hacking village

68
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,480
uh yes it's around it's building around

69
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,840
uh you know putting together the

70
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,599
community discovering

71
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,319
weaknesses and exposing vulnerabilities

72
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,599
that could significantly

73
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,159
impact the safety and security of all

74
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,040
drivers and passengers on the road today

75
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,720
so uh that's one of our inputs right

76
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,640
uh primary intentions on why we're

77
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,000
building that uh

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,280
car hacking village yeah uh can you hear

79
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,400
me clearly now

80
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,480
yes i think it's one of the panelists

81
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,000
that we have maybe they just push

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,799
something but right now it's okay all

83
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:01,760
right

84
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,879
a wonderful technology yeah

85
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,920
okay next is uh and every year we have

86
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,120
something new

87
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,280
so basically something new for today is

88
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,400
that we are virtual

89
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,079
of course and then we have new members

90
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,279
and then we have special guests

91
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,600
from singapore that will be presenting

92
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,479
their talk

93
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,880
which will be on october 9 in the

94
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,720
evening

95
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,320
then next year we are planning to

96
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,919
bring an actual car and also present our

97
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,120
car in a box

98
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,360
uh we had some instrument clusters last

99
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,639
year but

100
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,440
uh supposed to be we have we will be

101
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,000
having a car

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,880
in a box for this year but we believe

103
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,080
that

104
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,479
we will do justice if we present it next

105
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,120
year

106
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,639
so that it's interactive and also um

107
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,240
to showcase really how to tweak your car

108
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,680
and also how to um reverse engineer it

109
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,199
especially the can bus protocol so

110
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,600
thanks to jeff he will be helping us

111
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,440
with bringing an actual car who is one

112
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,400
of our

113
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,680
new members please

114
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,160
please do not hit the car it's his own

115
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,240
car that he's bringing him

116
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,880
that's how generous this guy is yeah

117
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,240
unlike defcon

118
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,520
we will not be hitting the uh the actual

119
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,759
car we will be hacking it but not

120
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,120
um hitting or destroying it okay

121
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,880
please do not break the car yeah

122
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,440
and then how far we've come this was

123
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,560
last year

124
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,680
that we have our instrument clusters

125
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,919
we taught people how to interact with

126
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,120
the can

127
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,720
basically uh having an instrument

128
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,560
cluster is one of the

129
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,560
greatest way to practice uh

130
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,160
how to reverse engineer the can bus

131
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,120
protocol and then um

132
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,720
jammy he had fun with how to

133
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,120
uh turn it on actually he was he was the

134
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,160
grease monkey

135
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,759
of this project and i was the uh canvas

136
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,880
uh guy for this project and then

137
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,639
we also have it it was it was definitely

138
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,520
a good practice for both of us i would

139
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,080
say

140
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,000
uh would you agree yes i do

141
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,440
and then um we also have our own virtual

142
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,440
instrument cluster

143
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,520
that we have we use the craig smith's

144
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,680
software that we run on as ubuntu linux

145
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,280
and then um we also have an ecu

146
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,160
simulator

147
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,600
a hardware based ecs emulator wherein we

148
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,880
try to interact with the uds messages

149
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,080
from the ecu and then our friends from

150
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,120
india

151
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,000
arun mani and nicol bogem brought their

152
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,919
own anomaly detections

153
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:01,199
system or ads which allows you to

154
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,479
get an idea on how to trigger anomalies

155
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,440
on a car

156
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,479
and then create an alert for it

157
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,759
so basically how it works is that

158
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,280
for example you send a normal

159
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,319
ecu can messages or uds messages into

160
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,680
the acu

161
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,160
now if someone spoofs the uds messages

162
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,880
on a different time or a different log

163
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,599
time

164
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,120
it will try to alert you with this kind

165
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,000
of

166
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,039
poc or proof of concept so yeah we had

167
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:35,440
fun

168
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,479
and then it was really uh

169
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,080
a great work for jeremy in being

170
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,000
able to power up the clusters that we

171
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,160
have and

172
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,240
actually uh the two clusters that we

173
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,000
have are from mazda

174
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,120
too not my own mass that do but

175
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,800
uh it's from a broken car

176
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,840
a newly broken car and then we also have

177
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,160
a pg-207 um it was vincennet who brought

178
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,280
me that one

179
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,520
and then um nicole bogam

180
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,319
brought also an instrument cluster

181
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,199
paired with the

182
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,360
ads i forgot what's the brand of doubt

183
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,120
of the instrument cluster that you have

184
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,790
because it's not that familiar to me but

185
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,960
[Music]

186
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,840
came all the way from india so they also

187
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,440
presented their topics actually

188
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,000
all right so here is our main

189
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,599
inspiration

190
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,200
i was actually the one who took the

191
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,719
photo this was from def con

192
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,479
our main inspiration really is from the

193
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,560
car hacking village and afghan

194
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,880
and we actually want to have this in

195
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,000
root gun

196
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,200
so we from time to time jammy and i

197
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,120
and the new uh village members

198
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,240
we actually recruited new members to two

199
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,760
of them

200
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,880
and we are building our own car in a box

201
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,360
so next year we hope to

202
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,560
showcase it and then pretty much like

203
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,959
the same poc from the left picture

204
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,959
and from the right picture you can see a

205
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,000
couple of ecu's and also

206
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
a couple of um microcontrollers

207
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
that are trying to send messages in the

208
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,040
ecu

209
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,600
and this was used during the defcon ctf

210
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,480
for the car hacking village

211
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,320
so if you if you want to donate or if

212
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,640
you want to

213
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,839
give us your old car parts

214
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,040
please reach out to me or jammy

215
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,560
so jamie do you have any uh thank you

216
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,480
uh we're showing everyone this because

217
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,320
uh again not only that we're asking them

218
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,920
for donations but

219
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,080
what our goal part of our goal is to

220
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,720
deliver the same experience of

221
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,040
having a car in a box uh making sure

222
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,640
that the research

223
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,920
for car hacking village in the

224
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,079
philippines would be full-blown

225
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,920
uh that we won't be showing you just

226
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,160
parts parts per parts uh on how it works

227
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,720
and how the best for vulnerabilities but

228
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,240
instead we wanted to provide them with

229
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,640
the full experience and you know we

230
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,160
would love for them to play around with

231
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,480
it

232
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,920
uh given that it's already there

233
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,000
so pretty much that's all i could add on

234
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,600
this slide uh

235
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,360
it's again about the experience of our

236
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,880
attendees yeah

237
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,760
but currently we actually have a mazda6

238
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,720
ecu kit

239
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,399
as well uh we haven't uh played with it

240
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,839
for a while yet because of covid and

241
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,360
we also have a bmw ecu kit

242
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,959
so uh it's a surprise for attending

243
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,360
this bmw yeah so basically uh we don't

244
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:53,760
have

245
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,200
the engine for it we don't have an

246
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,959
engine for it but we have

247
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,720
uh the required parts to

248
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,760
unlock the messages sent by an

249
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,200
ecu from bmw and also massdev6

250
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,519
and also they have we also have their

251
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,880
own

252
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,079
instrument clusters so next year

253
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,200
for sure we can have it because uh

254
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,000
we just added two new guys as well to

255
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,399
the

256
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,920
chv family in the philippines

257
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,000
then um this was last year just

258
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,680
highlight so we appeared in

259
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,360
the national television uh

260
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,480
abs-cbn um

261
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,959
it it tears me up because they are gone

262
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,480
right now

263
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,079
and it's on a documentary i think it's

264
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,120
hacker or baby hacker and then

265
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,040
to get together with other root can

266
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,279
goons because of monday clicking

267
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,399
interview in abs-ibn

268
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,480
so we had a workshop about car hacking

269
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,480
101 last year

270
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,079
and um we also taught people how to

271
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,800
attack or hack an infotainment and also

272
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,639
the common attack surfaces of a

273
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,399
connected vehicle

274
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,839
and can bus hacking 101 so this was

275
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,880
the um the main showcase that we have

276
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,760
last year

277
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,279
and also the workshop that we have

278
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,600
we invited speakers from india and then

279
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,000
the speakers from india also gave a talk

280
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,040
about

281
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,320
uh their abs in the main tracks

282
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,440
so i hope uh they

283
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,639
will be back next year i've talked to

284
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,720
him and he said that he will be back

285
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,839
he will be back next year after kovit

286
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,320
so we also handed out nano can pcbs

287
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,480
to some attend this for free uh

288
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,000
basically for nano can

289
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,079
as long as you have nano can pcb you can

290
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,440
already build your

291
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,120
own car hacking tool for just five

292
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,639
dollars all you need

293
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,600
is an arduino nano and an mcp2515

294
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,200
which is a microcontroller can module

295
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,959
so if you hook it up with can high and

296
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,680
can low wires of

297
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,000
the car you can already send messages to

298
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,399
the car

299
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,720
and then um yep we did share some

300
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,600
awesome chv stuff with our friends at

301
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,079
women

302
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,519
code manila so we taught them about

303
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,760
our project as well and how to send

304
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,040
messages through the can protocol

305
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,639
and it was actually jammy and i

306
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,279
who went to women's code manila and it

307
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,000
was held

308
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,560
in uh athleticism

309
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,479
yeah athletics office and bjc

310
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,399
and also we had some appearances in some

311
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,399
uh international conferences so for this

312
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,560
year we were at dragon con

313
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,680
besides myanmar knock

314
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,199
um sarcon background level up and also

315
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,240
at ola's seaside so aaron money and i

316
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,440
gave a talk

317
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,000
or a training for alwa seasides about

318
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,279
car hacking

319
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,399
osc sites is in goa india

320
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,800
and first of all i would like to give

321
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,760
shout outs

322
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,199
to the red team village

323
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,279
by abx they will be talking tomorrow

324
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,839
about red team red teaming so they have

325
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,279
awesome tracks

326
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,519
and that's where i i met them

327
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,880
last uh this year in nalcon and also uh

328
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,519
arun mani also for inviting us and for

329
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,079
giving us

330
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,720
encouragement on what to do with car

331
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,120
hacking

332
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,720
and now uh we are still

333
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,959
recruiting more members for our family

334
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,959
the chv family

335
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,480
and um yeah we are open for new members

336
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,800
who are car enthusiasts and hackers

337
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,079
and that's what you can see from the

338
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,920
panelists we actually have two new

339
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,880
members

343
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,839

344
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,760
so stay tuned later on

345
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,440
they will be talking about um

346
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,839
how to become a car mechanic and also

347
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,040
how to

348
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,519
tweak your car okay

349
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,399
and i know that most of you guys want to

350
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,079
start car hacking and in fact uh we

351
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,639
we got a lot of people who gave us good

352
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,399
feedbacks about the showcase that we

353
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,600
have last year

354
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,600
and also people asking where to start

355
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,600
so i would say that the best book that

356
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,320
you could ever

357
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,839
buy or you could read online

358
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,160
is the car hackers handbook by craig

359
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,519
smith

360
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,639
he was our k-note speaker

361
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,360
during root can 12 so he was wearing a

362
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,320
baron tagalog

363
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,399
and jamie is actually uh it turns out he

364
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,560
is a bigger fan boy than me so can you

365
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,480
tell about your experience jamie

366
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,759
with craig smith it was great so

367
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,279
uh the experience was quite personal for

368
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:23,600
us

369
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,800
because uh believe it or not the way we

370
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,880
started with car hacking village in the

371
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,600
philippines

372
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,480
is jade bringing the car hackers

373
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,800
handbook coming from defcon

374
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,360
sharing it with me and sir centrix you

375
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,600
know like college kids were in

376
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,399
we had to have a copy we're not we're

377
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:42,720
not

378
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,120
you know satisfied with the with the

379
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,360
digital copy we wanted to flip onto the

380
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,040
pages so we had a

381
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,079
copy for ourselves and then uh

382
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,279
craig smith coming in uh

383
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,759
we picked him up in the airport the

384
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,800
wife's really

385
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,880
really nice uh and then

386
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,439
all the way to the top during defcon uh

387
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,119
sorry during root gun

388
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,720
uh it was a surreal experience uh

389
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,400
i know we don't geek out that much but

390
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,400
it was a surreal experience

391
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,280
uh we've learned a lot from him uh we've

392
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,240
asked him

393
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,280
for advice on how to build our test

394
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,079
benches

395
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,959
uh we laid out our plans on how we

396
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,160
wanted to do it

397
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,840
how how we wanted it to work uh

398
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,720
for our research and he was able to walk

399
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,679
us through

400
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,200
uh that that definitely a really good

401
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,640
experience so

402
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,320
uh hopefully we could have him again

403
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,919
soon uh

404
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,640
maybe this time for aviation uh aviation

405
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,039
security or something

406
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,080
yeah i mean he he he actually he was

407
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,200
uh also a fun thing

408
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,720
or fun fact uh i was at nalcon

409
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,559
uh this year as well and um

410
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,640
i was shocked that craig smith uh came

411
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,480
to my talk and he said that

412
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,160
i didn't know that you still use the

413
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,080
module that i've actually built for

414
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,520
metasploit and i said yeah

415
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,640
i've actually made one module

416
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,400
for the hardware bridge for metasploit

417
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,320
about it and he said that

418
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,320
didn't know that some guys are still

419
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,360
using his head

420
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,760
it's really for me it's really a good

421
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,080
tool because it allows you to

422
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,120
give you a

423
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,160
a knowledge or it gives you

424
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,960
a great plc on like how to pop the

425
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,640
airbags of the car

426
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,880
uh how to do i mean how to reset your

427
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,600
ecu or also how to

428
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,919
send canned messages to the car using

429
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:44,720
metasploit

430
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,039
and then i tried to like you know do a

431
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,120
man in the middle on the attack

432
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,160
by dumping the canned messages sent by

433
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,640
metasploit and that's where i learned as

434
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,520
well

435
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,039
so craig smith is really

436
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,240
uh an awesome guy and if you can go to

437
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:02,640
his

438
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,400
uh to his repo in his github repo

439
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,240
you can see some of the awesome tools

440
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,240
that you that he have written

441
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,440
and the pdf version for car hacking

442
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,280
uh the car hackers handbook is actually

443
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,799
free so

444
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,640
you can see from your screen right now

445
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,360
the link it's actually free

446
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,679
but if you want to get the physical copy

447
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,039
you need to buy it from

448
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,160
amazon or other bookstores

449
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,360
i'm not sure if it's in national

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,760
bookstore i think not but

451
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,280
if you get a chance to go to defcon or

452
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,880
other hacking conference they usually

453
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,600
sell this book we we actually have one

454
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,799

uh let me just go through to the uh

472
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,440
to the car hacking resources uh the

473
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,159
first

474
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,280
link that you have is the nanocan uh you

475
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,039
get source code from there

476
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,799
and um under github.com

477
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,360
rootkin labs we also have uh car hacking

478
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,120
sketches for the nanocan

479
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,000
so i've written some sketches on how to

480
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,679
fuzz your instrument cluster for

481
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:44,880
massdep2

482
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,520
and also for pg207 and then

483

this year

488
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,960
so he has written um

489
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,440
a fuzzer as well for some uh for his

490
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,240
project

491
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,880

a can

497
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,159
using command line tools you need to go

498
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,960
to carhackingvillage.com

499
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,159
getting minus started so

500

people to follow and more cool stuff

508
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,480
about vehicle security

509
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,919
car security or car hacking and how to

510
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,679
tinker with the functionality of your

511
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,679
car so it's under

512
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,120
j red jared decoder

513
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,400
slash awesome vehicle security so you

514
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,200
you need to check out this repo as well

515
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,240
it also

516
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,400
uh from that repo you can also see some

517
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,360
talks that are published online and then

518
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,880
of course

519
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,120
uh you can't miss out the carjacking

520
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,200
village videos from defcon

521
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,200
uh they've recorded the videos from

522
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,440
defcon so you can just

523
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,320
skim through it or watch it and then

524
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,400
also if you are in a hacker conference

525
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,480
don't forget to visit its car hacking

526
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,280
village

527
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,559
or right now a lot of virtual hacking

528
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:39,600
conferences

529
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,880
have car hacking villages as well um

530
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,640
take for example uh knock on

531
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,080
hardware hardware io and also

532
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,400
um hack the box in fact uh

533
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,760
hack the box singapore uh

534
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,880
have its own car hacking village which

535
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,679
is uh

536
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,200
organized by dev zero's

537
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,640
car security quarterly which is led by

538
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,240
alina tan

539
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,400
she is also one of our speakers on

540
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,440
october 9th

541
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,000
so it's still under the car hacking

542
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,640
village

543
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,640
tracks and then

544
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,760
i would like to plug some tool that is

545
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,240
new

546
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,720
for car hacking uh cmap it's called cmap

547
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,720
open source vehicle services mapping

548
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,919
tool uh

549
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,919
it's basically like carrying caribou but

550
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:34,960
it's

551
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,600
under heavy development and much more

552
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,320
updated

553
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,400
right now cmap is written by car [ __ ]

554
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,919
or robert lille he is the founder of the

555
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,799
car hacking village

556
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,880
then um emmanuel it's your time up

557
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,720
all right so for additional tips of

558
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,559
course if we know the

559
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,679
technical side of the ecu and

560
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,000
how to work out the khan hai and con

561
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,039
candle

562
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,679
or the canvas codes uh we need to know

563
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,320
the manifestation or how it works

564
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,960
uh additional tips would be learning how

565
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,679
to read a car wiring diagram and able to

566
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:14,880
power up

567
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,279
you know the bunch of parts that you're

568
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,200
getting from the junkyard

569
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,960
and using for your testing or test

570
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,120
benches and then

571
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,480
uh there you could find it in you do

572
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,320
you know watch a couple of videos there

573
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,960
on how to read the wiring diagram

574
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,000
or you could source for other

575
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,679
other websites that provides you with

576
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,360
the wiring diagram for

577
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,240
the certain brand of or specs that

578
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,600
you're working with

579
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,720
uh once one website was very

580
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,880
efficient on my end when i was trying to

581
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,640
power up the parts

582
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,000
was automotive dash manuals.net uh

583
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,360
they have it for different brands now

584
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,440
uh one of the best things that you

585
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,200
should learn

586
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,240
learn how to use a multimeter uh

587
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,840
later on i'd be thanking the guy who

588
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,760
taught me how to use it

589
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,640
because it's very efficient uh learn

590
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,880
where to search for the micro fuses of

591
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,760
the parts in able to power up the parts

592
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,640
uh

593
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,200
even for uh you know even for the easy

594
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,039
use you you need to

595
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,520
know where to probe because it might

596
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,480
short or it

597
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,240
might cause shortage in terms of

598
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,000
electricity uh

599
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,799
because somehow it retains electricity

600
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,120
uh you don't want to be buying parts and

601
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,679
then

602
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,240
just putting in the waste because you

603
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,360
didn't know how these

604
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,480
uh multimeter to test it out and then

605
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,960
never miss out which is a can high and

606
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,159
tan low in your

607
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,960
in your you know car parts uh it's the

608
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,480
most important part it's

609
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,919
what it's what it is actually what sends

610
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,200
the signal

611
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,600
uh to your ecu

612
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,000
and the ecu signal going back to the

613
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,799
part

614
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,679
uh telling them you know what the part

615
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:02,720
is supposed to do

616
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,080
so uh without knowing that i don't think

617
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,720
your your venture or your experiment

618
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,559
would work

619
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,919
yeah and to add that uh can also runs on

620
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,720
the air buses that we have for airplanes

621
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,600
right now

622
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,480
and also just to add it's not just scan

623
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:20,960
that's

624
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,919
used as a protocol for cars there's also

625
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,200
canolin

626
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,799
and also there is also flex ray

627
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,600
that's also being used for um

628
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,600
[Music]

629
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,480
for car hacking

630
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,080
and then um aside from that

631
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,039
uh here's an additional tip when you are

632
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,799
in a car hacking bug bash

633
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,919
or engagement um one of the best tools

634
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,039
that i really like

635
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,919
because it's very simple and also

636
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:52,720
because

637
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,880
it is written in python 3

638
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,720
and it's very light it's

639
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,760
it's one of the tools that i use for

640
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,679
fuzzing the uds

641
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,960
and then also for um

642
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,720
you know discovering the attack surfaces

643
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,080
of a car so carrying caribou is one of

644
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,720
the best

645
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,960
uh tools that that i could recommend

646
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,240
it's open source

647
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,039
and then um you can also send any of the

648
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,919
spring frames

649
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,799
from the dirty side so ob2 or from the

650
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,760
infotainment system

651
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,559
and then um you know this is one of the

652
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:42,880
uh

653
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,480
bypasses in a system so if you can

654
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,520
send the scan frames from an obd2

655
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,919
or from the infotainment system it is

656
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:52,640
considered

657
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,679
as a p1 or a critical vulnerability

658
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,760
and it's also considered as a broken off

659
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,360
or secure gateway bypass

660
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,039
because right now cars have sgw

661
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,399
or firewalls so sgw

662
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,760
or security gateway is a term

663
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,399
in automotive automotive industry for

664
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,360
firewalls and cars

665
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,760
so how do you know if it's successful

666
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,799
you should

667
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,760
have a positive reply from the frame

668
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,919
which is 0 to

669
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:28,559
5101 from a certain id

670
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,360
so negative responses starts with zero

671
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,320
times zero three

672
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,240
so as a reminder this two frames

673
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,480
actually do ecu hard resets

674
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,039
and um you know when you say car hacking

675
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:45,679
bug bash

676
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,960
it's actually an event wherein we invite

677
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,000
car hackers to hack cars

678

the best way to ge uh to

788
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,120
[Music]

789
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,760
to get started with car hacking is to go

790
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,799
to ebay

791
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,480
uh visit ebay and then type in ecu kits

792
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,000
so if you want to start reverse

793
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,679
engineering a sample

794
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,800
canvas protocol you can buy an

795
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,879
instrument cluster for just

796
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:16,239
um 25 so that's how cheap it is

797
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,560
and if you want to buy the whole ecu kit

798
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,960
which are used ecu kits

799
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,760
it costs like 100 or 125 dollars in ebay

800
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,719
and they ship it in the philippines okay

801
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,719
in fact uh when i got my bmw ecu kit

802
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,639
uh the box was from

803
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,520
mac mac pro and i thought i was having a

804
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,399
macro

805
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,119
uh being shipped to me but when i opened

806
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,480
it it was

807
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,040
uh the ecu kit for bmw

808
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,879
that's really an interesting uh question

809
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:56,480
and in fact um starting with car hacking

810
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,359
or building your own test bench

811
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:03,520
the chv from singapore will be

812
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,079
actually uh teaching you guys or giving

813
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,079
a talk about it

814
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,839
so sermon said that

815
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:16,160
sergey what's your beauty regimen uh

816
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,560
i eat coffee uh

817
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,400
i eat two eggs every day

818
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,240
okay next question

819
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,240
what's the car brand best to start with

820
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,720
uh that's that's actually a tricky

821
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,440
question

822
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,160
it depends actually so um

823
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,440
i think the bet for me starting with it

824
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,400
um

825
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,200
the best car brand to start with is a pg

826
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,079
207

827
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,200
with its instrument cluster or uh

828
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,400
mazda um mazda has a lot of

829
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,760
uh a lot of parts that you can buy

830
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,880
from your master

831
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,440
um store or what you call it casa

832
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,839
so you you can actually buy some of

833
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,359
their parts as long as you give

834
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,480
the mechanic some you know money

835
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,480
so you can you can buy some of the

836
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,480
infotainment from there

837
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,760
so have you tried in your actual car yes

838
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,839
uh i've actually tried my own mazda

839
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,119
and i was able to uh pop shell

840
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,800
on the infotainment system and then for

841
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,160
toyota hilux i was able to

842
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,320
use a p1 dashboard in order to

843
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,920
uh sniff the can bus

844
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,760
and there and then there's also another

845
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,599
question do you think car hacking will

846
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:50,079
become

847
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,920
widely relevant in the philippines in

848
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,000
the next three to five years

849
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,800
i believe so i think it will it will

850
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,760
really be

851
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,880
relevant because we have uh

852
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,160
connected cars right now and

853
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,079
in the market there are a lot of

854
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,599
filipinos buying cars

855
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,599
that's why it's very traffic here in the

856
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:10,720
philippines

857
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:15,359
so for car hacking i think in the next

858
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,160
the next few

859
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,400
[Music]

860
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,880
in the next few years maybe we'll have

861
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,200
vapt for cars

862
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,640
and in fact uh car hacking bug bashes

863
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,000
um you know um

864
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,800
it's still in the states but maybe if we

865
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,560
have more car hackers

866
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,000
uh squashing bugs uh for some car

867
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,599
manufacturers

868
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,800
uh they could actually um

869
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,960
maybe they would reach out to filipino

870
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,400
car hackers

871
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,160
so there's another question i have a

872
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,480
spare mega squirt version three

873
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,320
how can i start with that and use it

874
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,680
with a cluster

875
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,040
um i've actually have not used it but

876
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,400
uh sir jasellis and sir jeff

877
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,839
knows about megasquirt we've talked it

878
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:04,160
yesterday

879
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:08,560
and um sir jay salis maybe they have

880
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,680
any uh information or sir jeff maybe do

881
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,720
you have answers

882
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,400
first question because i haven't tried

883
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,839
with mega squirt

884
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,839
yet

885
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,400
hello yes hello um if you have a mega

886
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,280
squirt

887
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,720
i guess you have to identify which car

888
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,680
you're gonna install

889
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,960
there and then find a

890
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,079
uh wiring diagram of the mega square

891
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,560
and then compared with the compared it

892
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,240
with the

893
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,880
stock diagram from there you can pin out

894
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,920
the

895
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,440
connection of mega square to your

896
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,680
car

897
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,760
right yeah that answers the question so

898
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,880
um right next is a scanner requirement

899
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,320
for car hacking it's not really a

900
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,040
requirement

901
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,520
but if you want to um it's one of the

902
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,440
most widely used protocol

903
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,800
so basically if you uh

904
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,000
if you dig in into the can can bus

905
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,680
reverse engineering you can

906
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,880
unlock some of the secrets of the car so

907
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,440
but it's not a car car hacking is not

908
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,240
just about

909
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,200
can bus hacking it's also about iot

910
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,480
hacking and

911
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,160
um hardware hacking because take for

912
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,520
example um

913
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,160
the infotainment system it runs on linux

914
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,280
and

915
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,520
for you to be able to pop a shell for

916
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,119
that you need to know about

917
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,480
um iot hacking

918
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,680
so yep then that answers it

919
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,760
and then will car hacking be extended to

920
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,599
motorcycles as well yes

921
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,480
we have a main track talk that we'll be

922
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,960
talking about how to

923
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,680
reverse engineer the can for motorcycles

924
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,359
because motorcycles

925
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,839
especially

926
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,440
especially if it is a fuel-injected

927
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,400
system

928
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,839
it allows you to

929
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,160
play with the ec on it so is this about

930
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,720
initially connecting into obd2

931
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,160
it's not just obd2 so obd2 is one of the

932
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,440
um

933
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,960
standard uh surfaces for a car

934
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,680
so basically for obd2 right now they're

935
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,760
trying to like sandbox it or putting a

936
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,280
protection against it

937
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,560
because if you can flash the firmware or

938
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:37,359
i mean do an ecu card reset on a car

939
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,520
using obd2 and then there's a firewall

940
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,480
on it

941
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,119
uh basically that's a vulnerability

942
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,119
because they uh

943
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,400
right now it has sa or security access

944
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,560
if you try to interact with the uds

945
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,440
message for it

946
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,359
have you tried hacking the wireless key

947
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,440
yes

948
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,640
you actually need a

949
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,439
heck rf and also

950
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:10,480
you know something that allows you to

951
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,240
uh call this

952
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,359
capture the uh signal from it

953
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,599
but this is kind of tricky right now

954
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,040
because of rolling codes

955
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:27,280
so it doesn't work uh in most cars right

956
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:27,839
now

957
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:34,079
but there there is a way called um roll

958
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,119
gem attacked

959
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,000
so yeah for roll drum attack you need to

960
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,319
uh

961
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,839
you need some dos or you need to jam

962
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,680
uh the key that was sent and then you

963
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,240
reuse it so that's a roll jam attack

964
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,280
um sami kumkar has a good

965
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,839
has a good uh video about it for roll

966
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:55,359
jam attacks

967
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:59,839
is car hacking similar to a vapt

968
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,160
i actually can't answer it but somehow

969
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:04,800
it is

970
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,880
if you are an engage you have an

971
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,319
engagement for it

972
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:12,000
but usually right now uh there are

973
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,240
bug bashes for car hacking and then

974
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,359
there are also

975
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:18,800
uh bug bounties related to car hacking

976
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,200
so if you go to buckrad.com sorry for

977
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,119
promoting but backroad.com

978
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,000
fca uh you can see it there and for

979
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,040
hacker one

980
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:31,839
uh jm is one of their um client

981
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,839
jay we have a couple of questions more

982
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:36,800
from the chat

983
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,119
um jenny is asking us to give them a

984
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,440
rundown of the cheapest way to gear up

985
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,000
and start hacking

986
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,720
so yes i've already answered that

987
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,439
question actually

988
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,599
yeah i've already answered that one okay

989
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,319
uh devnet also has a question are hybrid

990
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,560
or electric cars more hackable than

991
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,599
i guess traditional cars um

992
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,520
it depends on the attack surface but

993
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,920
because it has more attack surfaces

994
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,119
uh basically it is but you know

995
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,760
it's not just about hacking the

996
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,400
hacking the can or also try to opening

997
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,359
its doors

998
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:20,560
there is also another attack being

999
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,359
being discussed right now for a battery

1000
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:24,400
management system

1001
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,680
for bms take for example for

1002
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,480
most electric car if you could actually

1003
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,119
am

1004
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,720
um increase the amperage for

1005
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,319
for the battery management system you

1006
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,800
can actually uh

1007
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,400
you can actually break your car so

1008
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,400
that's that's actually injurious and

1009
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,200
also

1010
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,400
to destroy your car and um

1011
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,880
we are trying we are trying to discuss

1012
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,839
about

1013
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:53,200
how to add a custom battery pack

1014
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,760
for a car so that's actually considered

1015
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,880
a vulnerability

1016
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,359
right now

1017
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,440
um right now the project that i have

1018
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,839
is is actually reviewing an ice iso

1019
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:10,400
21431 which is rated to say uh vehicle

1020
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,760
security

1021
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,800
and um i'm just

1022
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,720
scamming uh scanning through the notes

1023
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,480
for it and um

1024
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,920
there's a lot of things that are being

1025
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,240
discussed in the car hacking community

1026
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,520
or automotive security

1027
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,880
so to sum up the question yes we've

1028
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,359
actually

1029
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,560
tried to hack our own cars and

1030
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,760
it doesn't go well sometimes okay i have

1031
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,359
a question what's the worst that can

1032
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:42,400
happen if you try

1033
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,280
if you what if you make a mistake what's

1034
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,440
the worst that can happen

1035
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,119
um uh one example is

1036
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,160
uh being able to uh shut down the

1037
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,359
headlamp

1038
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,760
okay it is injurious to health or

1039
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,200
injurious

1040
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,920
uh you know to the driver and also uh

1041
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,160
popping up the airbags

1042
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,400
so that's also injurious to the driver

1043
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,920
so from there

1044
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,920
we can consider that as a critical

1045
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,119
vulnerability

1046
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,920
because it harms the driver or the user

1047
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,319
right

1048
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,480
how about breaking the car is that is

1049
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,000
there a big chance to break

1050
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
your your own car if you try this in

1051
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,040
your like

1052
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,160
your your own family car

1053
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,400
yes it's possible so that's why you need

1054
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,200
to

1055
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,720
uh read on the um

1056
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:34,160
uh diagnostics for the car

1057
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,400
is there a way to like re-flash the

1058
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,359
firmware

1059
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,520
something like that once you break your

1060
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,000
car that's right uh jeffrey demano will

1061
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,440
be talking about it

1062
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,040
okay and re-flash

1063
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:51,680
[Laughter]

1064
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,599
right there's also another question do

1065
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,040
you need to be physically close to the

1066
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,640
car or can this be done

1067
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,640
through the net automotive internet is

1068
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:04,800
uh is the future right now and also

1069
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,880
uh through telematics there is a way to

1070
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,599
be able to connect through your phone to

1071
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:14,640
turn on your car

1072
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,839
so yes it can be done is there any

1073
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:18,720
virtual

1074
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,079
odb to practice you mean obd so virtual

1075
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:22,720
obd

1076
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,319
to practice um if you want to

1077
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:28,560
i think the question here is is there a

1078
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,319
virtual way

1079
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:34,400
in order to simulate uh

1080
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,760
with a can bus protocol

1081
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,640
craig smith has a an open source tool

1082
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,200
called virtual instrument cluster

1083
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,240
so it's called icsm

1084
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,599
icsm i mean and you know

1085
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:56,480
you can just download it for free

1086
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,680
right maybe two more questions right two

1087
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,800
more questions

1088
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,440
ian asked if uh there are like people

1089
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,000
who do

1090
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,119
online courses for such because there

1091
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:08,640
are some people who love to follow

1092
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,240
modules or courses

1093
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,440
so um they they need

1094
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,839
do he also wants to know what the skill

1095
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:19,839
set is needed for something like this

1096
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,559
all right uh first of all for a skill

1097
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:23,440
set

1098
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,119
i would answer the skill set you just

1099
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:26,960
need basic linux

1100
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,400
skills and also hardware skills

1101
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,520
and as well as basic electronics so

1102
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:38,240
that's really needed and um you don't

1103
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,119
need to be

1104
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:41,599
physically connected to the car okay uh

1105
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:42,160
there's

1106
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,400
telematics and also you don't need to be

1107
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,599
inside the car for you to hack it

1108
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:51,680
okay and then

1109
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,880
yes sir dummies back how about online

1110
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,680
courses that

1111
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,079
uh something you can follow like module

1112
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:59,280
per module

1113
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,520
all right for online online courses

1114
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,359
there are virtual conferences

1115
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:08,079
that actually uh talks about car hacking

1116
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:11,280
hardware that io um is

1117
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,960
talking ab is having tracks

1118
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,359
about car hacking as well and sometimes

1119
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:18,400
i give

1120
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,920
i give a talks as well in in other

1121
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,839
virtual conferences and then um

1122
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:27,920
some of the conferences that i could say

1123
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,520
that have car hacking

1124
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,480
are hack the buck hack in the box and

1125
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,040
then

1126
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:37,200
defcon also uh

1127
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,880
hardware io and they have virtual

1128
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,160
appearances right now yeah i guess uh

1129
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,559
based on the questions that we hear

1130
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:49,119
i think it's mostly uh how to get people

1131
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:50,880
started it's the barrier of

1132
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,400
entry so if if this was a live root con

1133
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,720
jay and jamie would have all the gear in

1134
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,040
front of you to try

1135
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,079
yes uh next year if covet is gone we

1136
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:03,680
will bring an actual car

1137
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,359
yeah i'm sure that will be very

1138
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,800
interesting like next year

1139
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,280
there will be an actual car for their uh

1140
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,720
for you guys to try out

1141
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:17,839
yes

1142
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,319
i guess guys i guess that's it there are

1143
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:23,599
no more questions coming in as well

1144
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,520
excited to hear the next talks about the

1145
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,240
car hacking though

1146
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,119
yes uh sir jamie take it uh are you the

1147
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:32,000
nether

1148
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,760

getting back on

1153
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,280
uh i i think it's my network

1154
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,920
uh this was my fear when we were

1155
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,960
starting

1156
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,680
the conference this afternoon but happy

1157
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,520
to be back sorry i wasn't able to join

uh on that bit thanks gerwin for

1164
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,000
supporting us

uh yes for the next part

1166
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:21,280
i believe it was mentioned already by uh

1167
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,880
ship code while ago

1168
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,200
on who our speakers would be but to

1169
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,000
provide a formal

1170
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,119
introduction uh he's an experienced

1171
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,960
automotive technician

1172
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,800
a mechanic of different brands of

1173
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,240
automobiles

1174
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,000
and a cyber security enthusiast at the

1175
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,839
same time

1176
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:40,079
a walking wrench with the hacker's

1177
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,200
mindset

1178
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,480
combined with this interest which lies

1179
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,839
in vulnerabilities of automotive systems

1180
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:50,400
uh ladies and gentlemen he's also known

1181

00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,960
so my talk is about

1207
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,760
you're also a car mechanic so anyone

1208
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,319
here can also be a car mechanic

1209
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:27,599
so that's the good news okay and

1210
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,760
uh

1211
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,680
nowadays cars are also considered a

1212
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,880
necessity

1213
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,880
in our lifetime it is a privilege to

1214
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,160
learn how to drive one

1215
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,760
and a choice to know how to fix and

1216
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,240
maintain your own so this talk will help

1217
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,079
you understand the basics of an

1218
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:45,440
automotive system

1219
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,359
and how you'll be able to find courage

1220
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,440
to try and fix your own

1221
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,400
so uh the fundamentals of engine under

1222
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,119
chassis

1223
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,319
and transmission or uh in short

1224
00:52:56,319 --> 00:53:00,319
e-youth uh yeah it's of

1225
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:03,920
it doesn't sound right yeah and uh

1226
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,920
here's a sample photo of me

1227
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,119
five years ago uh when i was doing

1228
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,400
carbureted engines

1229
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,160
and uh who am i 12 years experience in

1230
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,240
the automotive industry as an automotive

1231
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,040

home service

1234
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,800
as a mechanic during my spare time it

1235
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,400
can be full time sometimes

1236
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,760
depends on the schedule race car driver

1237
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,319
that was in the past and also project

1238

companies

1240
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,680
preferably software development

1241
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,079
companies also cyber

1242
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:43,280
security and 20 years and counting

1243
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,400
active golfer i played a lot of golf

1244
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,040
but unfortunately it's uh we're on a

1245
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,640
lockdown i can't play anymore

1246

and also gamer i play a lot of games

1247
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,359
guys so yeah

1248
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,760
so major parts of an automotive system

1249
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:00,960
we have the engine

1250
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,920
the under chassis and transmission but

1251
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,319
for

1252
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,720
my talk um i'll be focusing on the

1253
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,400
engine side

1254
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,920
because uh i have a limited

1255
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,119
time for this stock i'll not be able to

1256
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:16,960
tackle the android chassis and the

1257
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,520
transmission side

1258
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:23,200
so uh basic tools starter pack

1259
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,880
for you to become a mechanic okay

1260
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:31,920
so first you have to have obd2 scanner

1261
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,119
an analog or digital multimeter

1262
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:39,200
so uh trade drive socket set ratchet set

1263
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,599
we all know what a ratchet is 8

1264
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,400
millimeter to 14 millimeter socket

1265
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,520
bent or straight long nose pliers low

1266
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,240
profile

1267
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,839
floor jacks 2 or 3 ton floor just will

1268
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:52,000
do

1269
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,319
two pieces jack stands for safety

1270
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:55,760
purposes

1271
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,599
um and courage yes because

1272
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:01,920
practice with your own car first make

1273
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,319
sure it's still under warranty and

1274
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:08,880
paid insurance a little bit of muscle

1275
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,040
because uh you'll be uh tightening and

1276
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,000
loosening

1277
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,040
nuts and bolts okay a little bit of

1278
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,359
memory okay because you'll be

1279
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:18,559
disassembling some

1280
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:21,520
automatic parts and a little bit of

1281
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,280
google

1282
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,720
google is our friend so here's

1283
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:29,440
a simple animation of how an engine

1284
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,000
works

1285
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,119
here on the right side so the engine is

1286
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,480
the heart of your car

1287
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,960
it is a complex machine built to convert

1288
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,040
heat from burning gas into the force

1289
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,040
that turns the road wheels

1290
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,040
the chain reactions which achieve that

1291
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,760
objective set in motion by a spark

1292
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,640
which ignites a mixture of petrol vapor

1293
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,799
and compressed air inside a momentarily

1294
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:53,040
sealed cylinder and causes it to burn

1295
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,079
rapidly

1296
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:55,839
that is why the machine is called an

1297
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:58,559
internal combustion engine

1298
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:01,760
okay so the normal stoichiometric air

1299
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,920
fuel mixture for a gasoline

1300
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,240
engine is 14.7 is one that's 14.7 grams

1301
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,520
of air

1302
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:13,280
and one gram of gasoline so

1303
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,760
i'll not be too technical of the

1304
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:16,880
automatic terms

1305
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,280
i'll try my best to translate it in

1306
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,599
layman's terms

1307
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:24,640
so this talk is kind of different so uh

1308
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:28,000
please bear with me guys it's uh it's 90

1309
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,440
automotive so everybody is welcome to

1310
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,200
learn new things so uh this is a

1311
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,359
this is an animation of some of the

1312
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:38,480
parts that

1313
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,839
are uh that are inside the engine

1314
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:44,559
so uh i will not explain this in details

1315
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:45,440
because

1316
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,720
we have limited time like i said

1317
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,440
um requirements your obd2 scanner is

1318
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,400
your best friend

1319
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,200
so everybody knows them and what a

1320
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,480
diagnostic tool

1321
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,559
looks like so we have here a

1322
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:00,880
professional diagnostic tool this big

1323
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:01,359
one

1324
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:04,720
this costs a lot around

1325
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,079
six thousand dollars plus plus

1326
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:11,119
and uh this small one uh you can

1327
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:12,160
purchase it for

1328
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,280
200 300 and the uh

1329
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,119
the famous elm 327

1330
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:21,920
uh this is a bluetooth uh obd2

1331
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,280
diagnostic tool

1332
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,319
you can buy this on ebay or

1333
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:29,440
anywhere anywhere

1334
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,640
and of course our two best friends here

1335
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,040
also i consider them as our best friends

1336
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:35,760
also

1337
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,799
a an analog type multimeter and an

1338
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:42,000
electronic type multimeter

1339
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,520
okay so your obd2

1340
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,880
uh scanner capabilities should have this

1341
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,960
ableton engine rpm able to read engine

1342
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,799
temperature

1343
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:57,920
able to read battery voltage are able to

1344
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:58,240
read

1345
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,520
abs wheel speed sensor this is optional

1346
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,160
able to read fuel trims and oxygen

1347
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,359
sensor voltage

1348
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:07,760
output this one is the most important

1349
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,799
here

1350
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:11,920
i'll discuss it along the along the way

1351
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,960
able to read misfire per cylinder it's

1352
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,559
still optional but

1353
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,599
still important yeah

1354
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:23,119
diagnosing a car over the phone in my 12

1355
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:23,760
years of

1356
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,400
experience uh to tell you honestly guys

1357
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,040
it's so hard to diagnose a car

1358
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:33,280
over the phone it's better if we see it

1359
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,319
personally

1360
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:36,720
not only in in the automotive industry

1361
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:37,920
if you diagnose

1362
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,000
something i mean over the phone it's

1363
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:40,960
it's kind of hard

1364
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,000
to be accurate

1365
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:46,480
so or if you can create your own obd2

1366
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,200
scanner

1367
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,920
better we have sergey turla and our

1368
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,440
carharen village community for this

1369
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,000
okay there's my legs credits to my legs

1370
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,040
and sergey turle's legs

1371
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,520
and uh check if all dashboard indicator

1372
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,319
lights

1373
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:06,000
are working so before you you uh

1374
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,119
try and uh experiment or hack your

1375
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:13,119
your ecu um better check if all your

1376
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:15,040
indicator lights are

1377
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,319
100 uh working so this is

1378
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:21,200
an example this is exclusive for honda

1379
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,000
only

1380
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,040
iv engine

1381
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,280
does it have a sound sir

1382
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:33,839
okay

1383
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:38,240
okay there's my dirty finger there

1384
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:38,799
there's my

1385
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:42,400
thumb sorry for that

1386
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,799
as you can see here all the indicator

1387
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:45,760
lights are

1388
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,000
illuminating so that means all sensors

1389
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,240
are working

1390
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:54,079
okay another press double check

1391
00:59:54,079 --> 01:00:00,960
okay all working all right

1392
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,440
uh basic engine parts there's intake

1393
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,720
manifold engine block

1394
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,200
cylinder head the bulbs the piston the

1395
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,240
crankshaft

1396
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,200
i love to explain this in detail but we

1397
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,960
have limited time um

1398
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,079
yeah just you know

1399
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:19,119
okay a typical engine but don't worry

1400
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:19,520
guys

1401
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:22,559
um not all engines are designed this way

1402
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:25,920
this is a more complicated design so

1403
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,359
this is just for reference

1404
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:32,720
um ecu we have a we have a standalone

1405
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,000
engine control package

1406
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
allows you the ability to bring out the

1407
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,079
best performance from your engine

1408
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:40,319
you can tailor as a solution to your

1409
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:42,400
specific set of requirements

1410
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,480
just like what i saw in the questions

1411
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,920
earlier uh

1412
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,960
a certain guy has a mega square version

1413
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:49,680
three

1414
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,960
um it will be tackled uh

1415
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,160
on on the next uh it will be tackled

1416
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,040
later on

1417
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:01,200
uh it will be uh discussed uh by sir

1418
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,200
jeff dimagno

1419
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,240
so let's keep on this

1420
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:10,160
uh another basic engine parts uh

1421
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:13,359
maf sensor mass airflow throttle body

1422
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:14,559
ignition coil pack

1423
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:18,960
fuel injectors spark plugs ect sensor

1424
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,680
and oxygen sensor these are the com

1425
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,119
these are the contents of

1426
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:27,520
of metal the most common easy to miss

1427
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,520
and misleading whatsoever engine

1428
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,760
problems you encounter in our cars

1429
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,720
or fuel economy due to very rich lean

1430
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,400
mixture of air fuel

1431
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,359
you will learn about a rich and lean

1432
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:40,240
mixture

1433
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:43,839
later on hard starting misfire or

1434
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:44,960
jerking

1435
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:48,400
loss of power erratic idle or rpm

1436
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,680
reading

1437
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:53,359
delayed throttle response this is a

1438
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:56,559
dangerous also last but last

1439
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:59,839
but not the least very poor maintenance

1440
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:02,960
as you can see here this block is like a

1441
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,839
bag in in the philippines or shrimp

1442
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:06,480
sauce in

1443
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:11,200
english this is very dangerous

1444
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,480
to your engine so

1445
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,520
as it gets worse

1446
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:20,960
in this case the my customer my customer

1447
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,640
here was

1448
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:26,720
it's like a year before she changed

1449
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,839
her her engine's lubricants so this is

1450
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:31,760
what happened to her engine

1451
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,960
luckily the engine is still operating

1452
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,640
and uh please guys don't

1453
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,839
don't buy cheaper oils or change your

1454
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:43,039
oil frequently

1455
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:45,359
okay

1456
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:50,000
so to distinguish a a

1457
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,119
good engine from a bad ones is of course

1458
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:55,039
the left side

1459
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:57,680
very poor poorly maintained while on the

1460
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,240
right side

1461
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:03,839
it's properly maintained okay

1462
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,359
so let's start mass airflow sensor

1463
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:09,599
a mass airflow sensor is a sensor used

1464
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:12,240
to determine the mass flow rate of air

1465
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,640
entering a fuel injected internal

1466
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,079
combustion engine

1467
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:18,319
the air mass information is necessary

1468
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:19,280
for the engine

1469
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,599
control unit to balance and deliver the

1470
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:24,160
correct fuel mass to the engine

1471
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:28,319
with ng.idle the maps parameter id value

1472
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:30,000
should read anywhere from 2

1473
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,960
to 7 grams at idle and rise to between

1474
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,640
15 to 25

1475
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:38,880
grams per second at 2500 rpm

1476
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,319
depending on engine size there are

1477
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,000
different kinds of engine there are four

1478
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,920
cylinders six cylinders and eight

1479
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,119
cylinders

1480
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:50,480
but uh let's focus on the four cylinder

1481
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,160
types which is the most common type of

1482
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,200
engines

1483
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,760
most manufacturers provide

1484
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,240
specifications for

1485
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:59,039
airflow at idle some will provide

1486
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:00,799
specifications at several

1487
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:03,839
engine speeds so symptoms of bad or

1488
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,680
failing map sensor

1489
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:08,400
the engine is very hard hard to start or

1490
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,920
turn over

1491
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:14,000
the engine stalls shortly after starting

1492
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,119
the engine hesitates or drags well under

1493
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:19,039
load or idle

1494
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:21,119
okay it's stumbling the engine is like

1495
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:22,400
stumbling

1496
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,839
hesitation and jerking during

1497
01:04:24,839 --> 01:04:26,160
acceleration

1498
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:29,039
of course uh most of us experience that

1499
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:30,160
in our cars

1500
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,880
or in our relatives cars the engine

1501
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,720
hiccups

1502
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,839
yeah it's like kangaroo excessive

1503
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:42,400
rich or lean idol okay so

1504
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:45,359
here is the here is a sample of mass

1505
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:46,720
airflow sensor

1506
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:49,920
guys um unfortunately as much as i love

1507
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:50,480
to

1508
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,799
show it to you in person but

1509
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:57,920
but uh it's it's really hard for us to

1510
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,440
to explain in words uh we prefer uh we

1511
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,880
we demo it live to you um

1512
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:08,400
so please bear with me i mean um

1513
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,720
maybe next year we'll have the actual

1514
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:11,839
car

1515
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:15,200
i'll voluntarily uh present my car

1516
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,680
so that you guys will easily understand

1517
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,039
the topic

1518
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:22,240
so uh yeah um going back

1519
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:26,480
um so deter so to determine if you have

1520
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:29,599
dirty map sensor uh here you can see

1521
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:32,880
the element here is dirty

1522
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:35,359
and uh if you clean it with electronic

1523
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:36,640
contact cleaner

1524
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,200
it will look like this and these hot

1525
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,720
wires tend to

1526
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:44,400
get dirt okay so because uh

1527
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,039
sometimes we forget to change our air

1528
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:48,160
filter

1529
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:51,359
and then once it's dirty it will uh

1530
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:54,240
suck in the dirt from the air filter and

1531
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,119
uh

1532
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:58,400
this will get dirty once this thing this

1533
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,160
wire gets dirty

1534
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:04,559
uh you will you will have this symptoms

1535
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:06,319
you will have this into engine hiccups

1536
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:07,680
hesitation

1537
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,359
the engine installed shortly after

1538
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:10,720
starting

1539
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:14,160
so uh better check this you can check

1540
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,200
this um

1541
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:20,000
by uh by disconnecting these two

1542
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,039
these two screws i mean it's very basic

1543
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:25,920
and uh just disconnecting this connector

1544
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:26,880
okay

1545
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,359
you can see this uh in your air filter

1546
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:30,839
box

1547
01:06:30,839 --> 01:06:34,640
okay next is the throttle body

1548
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,200
drive by wire a throttle body is a

1549
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,280
butterfly valve located between the air

1550
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:40,400
intake filter

1551
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,960
and the intake manifold it regulates how

1552
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,359
much air go into the engine

1553
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:47,680
based on driver input through the gas

1554
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,119
pedal

1555
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:52,000
as more air flows into the engine it

1556
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,119
injects more fuel

1557
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:56,240
thus allowing for more power symptoms of

1558
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:59,520
a bad or failing throttle body

1559
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:02,160
dirt grime and carbon deposits on the

1560
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,160
inside of the housing

1561
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:08,079
this one um grime can build up inside

1562
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:10,319
the housing causing interruption in air

1563
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:12,880
fuel flow so there'll be air

1564
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:13,760
restrictions

1565
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:16,400
if if the truck uh if the butterfly gets

1566
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,520
dirty this throttle plate here

1567
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,000
electrical problems vacuum leaks or an

1568
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,559
incorrectly adjusted throttle stop

1569
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:28,160
or or high idle okay same with the

1570
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:31,440
map sensor again so every time we

1571
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,920
diagnose these types of trouble um

1572
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,319
sometimes an experienced mechanic

1573
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:39,520
uh gets lost okay so

1574
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:43,119
yeah to clean this one okay you need to

1575
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:45,200
purchase a

1576
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,599
carb cleaner from your local automotive

1577
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:48,880
shop it's very cheap

1578
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,559
i think it's it's under 10 or 10 dollars

1579
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:54,839
the most

1580
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:58,480
um here you you can see the uh

1581
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,480
the light passing through the travel

1582
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:01,680
plate so

1583
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:04,319
this means that it's uh it's cleaned

1584
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:05,520
already

1585
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:08,559
um yeah

1586
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:11,440
moving on to the ignition call pack and

1587
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:12,960
spark plugs

1588
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,119
it is an electronically controlled pack

1589
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:16,319
of ignition coils

1590
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:18,719
regulated by the car's computer and is

1591
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:19,759
used to create

1592
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:22,080
the spark for each engine cylinder spark

1593
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,279
plug

1594
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:25,520
generally speaking coil packs are much

1595
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,920
more reliable than distributors

1596
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,839
because there are no moving parts and

1597
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:31,439
because they far much

1598
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:34,560
less often than a distributor coil packs

1599
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:36,479
usually create a better sport

1600
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:39,198
which in turn produce better combustion

1601
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:40,719
and horsepower in a car's

1602
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:44,960
engine okay and uh the spark plug

1603
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,839
most of us here know knows what a spark

1604
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:48,238
plug

1605
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:50,799
is so a spark plug is a device for

1606
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:51,679
delivering

1607
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:54,158
electric current from an ignition system

1608
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:55,600
to the combustion chamber

1609
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,319
of a spark ignition engine to ignite the

1610
01:08:58,319 --> 01:08:58,960
compressed

1611
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:02,080
fuel air mixture by an electric spark so

1612
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:02,880
uh

1613
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:06,158
this guy here the ignition car back it

1614
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:07,359
gives

1615
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:10,479
electricity the spark plug so it's very

1616
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,000
basic

1617
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,238
symptoms of a bad or failing coil and

1618
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:15,198
spark plug

1619
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:18,560
engine is far again same with the mouth

1620
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:21,198
and the total body so that what that's

1621
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:21,759
why

1622
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:24,319
it gets hard for the uh for the

1623
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:25,520
experienced mechanic

1624
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:28,799
to to diagnose rough ideal

1625
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:32,158
again very similar symptoms loss of

1626
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:34,560
power during acceleration

1627
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:38,158
again check engine light definitely

1628
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:41,600
hard start or no start at all so uh

1629
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:45,198
the the dtc means um

1630
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:48,799
the dtc for this is p0350 so this is a

1631
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:51,198
generic data trouble code

1632
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:55,040
um it depends on the

1633
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,280
manufacturer some are some doesn't

1634
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,480
represent this code

1635
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:01,199
some are different but release the

1636
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:03,839
generic ones

1637
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:06,880
so this is a simple animation for the

1638
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:07,600
spark plug

1639
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,800
inside the engine so

1640
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,800
it's here it's firing inside the

1641
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,840
combustion chamber

1642
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,840
okay

1643
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,440
so i have here slides um

1644
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:23,440
i think this was uh this was taken last

1645
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,040
week i had a

1646
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:28,800
customer so uh this is a very simple

1647
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,840
uh trouble she got in her engine

1648
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,960
the it showed a check engine and then

1649
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:35,760
she

1650
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:39,280
she panicked why is the car so sluggish

1651
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:42,960
why is the car slow why why is the car

1652
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,880
vibrating

1653
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:48,080
violently and

1654
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:51,679
etc etc so i'm gonna play uh four slides

1655
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:53,840
i think or five slides from here

1656
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:59,840
these are short short tips

1657
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:04,800
there we go there's a check engine there

1658
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:11,199
i'm using a 200 uh 200

1659
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:13,600
diagnostic tool that you can purchase uh

1660
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,360
from icar soft

1661
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:18,320
um this is a good uh diagnostic tool to

1662
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:19,120
start with

1663
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:22,480
for beginners and for experience

1664
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:25,199
this is good this is good uh diagnostic

1665
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:27,120
tool

1666
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:30,239
i'm sure you can afford it guys

1667
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:32,880
okay there there we go there's a there's

1668
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,120
the dtc

1669
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:38,080
p0351 ignition coil a primary secondary

1670
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:38,800
circuit

1671
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,440
so i already know where the trouble is

1672
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:44,080
because of this last digit

1673
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:47,840
which is one so that's cylinder one

1674
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,880
ignition coil pack okay guys

1675
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:55,199
so tip take the notes if you want

1676
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:59,679
if it's p0352 that's cylinder number two

1677
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:02,880
so in this system we have four cylinders

1678
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:08,800
so up to p0354 so that's the last four

1679
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,960
okay thanks of course um disconnect the

1680
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:13,840
battery

1681
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,159
in this uh short clip okay let's just

1682
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:18,159
play it

1683
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:21,360
i'm gonna disconnect the battery here

1684
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,600
okay i'm still inside the car i don't

1685
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,440
know where i am

1686
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:28,560
oh there you go

1687
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:31,360
okay oh before you service your car make

1688
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:32,320
sure to

1689
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:36,960
put a mattress here servicing mattress

1690
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:40,640
to prevent dents to the front bumpers

1691
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:42,080
so you can see here let's do it

1692
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,840
professionally

1693
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:47,679
wear gloves if you have latex the better

1694
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:50,719
it's thinner

1695
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:55,520
okay the negative terminals should

1696
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,199
should not make contact with the

1697
01:12:57,199 --> 01:13:00,800
positive it will fry the ecu

1698
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:04,400
and other electrical components

1699
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,760
okay so this is the very basics guys

1700
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:11,280
you can also do this with your car

1701
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:14,480
okay hello there

1702
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:18,800
okay there we go there's the ratchet

1703
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,800
there's the extension bar and there's

1704
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:24,960
the 12 10 millimeter socket

1705
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:30,560
okay oh okay

1706
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:34,159
so we're working on uh smaller bolts

1707
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:37,280
so let me pause uh let me give you a tip

1708
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,840
uh you don't need to use brute force

1709
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,360
when uh

1710
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:44,560
when loosening up a a nut or bolt

1711
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,719
because it's just a 10 millimeter you

1712
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:48,800
just need to slap your ratchet

1713
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:51,920
look at my uh there you go

1714
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:55,120
you slap it like that you don't need to

1715
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:58,840
use brute force brute force attack

1716
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:02,719
okay okay there we go

1717
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:06,400
turn those uh little ones

1718
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,639
okay

1719
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,040
okay okay turn it

1720
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:16,560
turn it all right

1721
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:20,640
again when removing this plastic cover

1722
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,800
you don't need brute force attack

1723
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:26,000
just need to shake and bit a little okay

1724
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,400
there we go

1725
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:32,719
all right now you're a mechanic

1726
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:35,920
just kidding guys just kidding um next

1727
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:39,760
is visual inspection of the yeah

1728
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,440
the problem or or the part

1729
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:48,000
that we're gonna tackle okay oops

1730
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,840
i'm gonna lower the volume i don't know

1731
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:53,280
if you can hear it also

1732
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:57,440
okay i'm just uh wiping the

1733
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:02,000
wiping it clean removing the dirt

1734
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:08,320
okay check the uh oil level

1735
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:11,199
right very uh standard uh operating

1736
01:15:11,199 --> 01:15:12,159
procedure

1737
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:16,559
sop okay

1738
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:21,120
check the engine oil if she put a diesel

1739
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:24,560
engine oil or gasoline engine oil oh

1740
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,880
i smelled it i don't know why i smelled

1741
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,120
it

1742
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:34,400
no just kidding you need to smell it to

1743
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:35,360
distinguish

1744
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:39,440
the oil

1745
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:43,519
you disconnect the yeah

1746
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:48,480
disconnect the ignition call path

1747
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:53,360
okay

1748
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:55,280
as you can see here i'm i'm kind of

1749
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,120
having a hard time disconnecting it

1750
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:01,040
because uh the car uh the car has

1751
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:04,840
i think it's its first time to be uh

1752
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:07,920
disconnected since it was since

1753
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,960
it was uh made so

1754
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:14,480
we call it virgin sockets

1755
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:20,400
all right i'm having a hard time there i

1756
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:23,120
don't know why

1757
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:27,280
all right there you go boy

1758
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:32,880
okay oh my goodness

1759
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,840
all right

1760
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,480
all right there we go i've disconnected

1761
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,639
it

1762
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:49,840
um at this moment uh it's very awkward

1763
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:52,719
because the owner is already uh

1764
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:54,719
is already laughing at me while i'm

1765
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:56,400
recording this

1766
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:59,760
so you know and

1767
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:02,880
and she's a girl so sometimes i get uh

1768
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,760
you know it's pretty awkward when

1769
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:08,800
someone's watching you

1770
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:15,040
all right okay don't need to brute force

1771
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:15,760
those

1772
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:18,960
small nuts and bolts

1773
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:25,120
all right a little turn there

1774
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:30,000
imagine if if we are in vista right now

1775
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,159
guys um you will get the chance to do

1776
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:33,520
this also

1777
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:36,719
after i demo it and then uh there's a

1778
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:38,880
there will be a chance that you will do

1779
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,800
this also

1780
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:45,760
in my car and sir jeff's car

1781
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,400
so we are prepared the money if you uh

1782
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:52,480
damage it or accidentally damage it

1783
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:54,880
not a problem we can uh repair it on

1784
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:57,199
spot

1785
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:01,120
all right there we go removing it

1786
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:06,000
okay there we go little guy

1787
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,000
oh what are you doing now

1788
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:14,560
and next step is to check the spark

1789
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:15,280
plugs

1790
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:17,599
first

1791
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,760
so they are like brothers and sisters

1792
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:23,679
the ignition coil pack and the spark

1793
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:27,199
plugs okay

1794
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:29,920
so if you get a trouble that is related

1795
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:31,520
to ignition callbacks

1796
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:35,199
might as well check the spark plugs

1797
01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:40,159
okay there you need a little slab again

1798
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:43,440
because it's a spark plug

1799
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:54,719
okay there we go

1800
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:59,120
i hope you guys can hear me properly um

1801
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:02,880
because my internet is

1802
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:06,960
is acting weird lately okay

1803
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:10,640
there we go i'm trying to show it

1804
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:13,760
oh my goodness my focusing skills is not

1805
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:15,679
that good

1806
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:18,640
i'm sorry for that

1807
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,320
okay

1808
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:25,520
ah the the next step is

1809
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:28,640
spark test so

1810
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:32,159
in this clip i'll be uh switching on the

1811
01:19:32,159 --> 01:19:37,839
ignition and start the car

1812
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,600
okay i started the car i don't know if

1813
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,719
does it have a sound

1814
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:48,840
can you hear it guys the the video the

1815
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:51,840
clip

1816
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:57,440
okay

1817
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,760
i'm trying to lift the ignition coil

1818
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:05,840
back here

1819
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,239
okay

1820
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:20,080
you see the engine did not respond while

1821
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:23,520
i'm lifting the coil back

1822
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:26,080
when lifting this call packs you need uh

1823
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:27,600
the engine should stumble

1824
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,480
should react if it does start reap

1825
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:31,600
meaning

1826
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,800
the uh ignition call pack is not working

1827
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,520
it's not functioning okay it's not

1828
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:38,800
firing uh

1829
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,960
it's not firing a spark it's not giving

1830
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,040
spark to the spark plugs

1831
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:47,040
okay so i lifted the second

1832
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:50,080
cylinder coil packs

1833
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:54,239
there the engine stumbled

1834
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:58,159
the third one there

1835
01:20:58,159 --> 01:21:02,159
it reacted it vibrated so

1836
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:05,679
so the callback 2 called pac3

1837
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:08,719
uh is good it's working but the the

1838
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:09,840
first one

1839
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:14,159
is not

1840
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:18,239
so here again it reacted

1841
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:23,120
okay so so this one is the culprit

1842
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:27,600
as the scanner told us so p0351

1843
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:31,440
okay so we're already there uh i may say

1844
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,120
it's already ninety percent

1845
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:36,320
um isolated already so

1846
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:40,559
let's move to the dtc arrays

1847
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:44,239
so i already bought the

1848
01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:47,760
the brand new ignition coil pack and

1849
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:50,719
i already installed it in the car and i

1850
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:52,239
already started it

1851
01:21:52,239 --> 01:21:54,480
now i'm about to erase the data trouble

1852
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,560
code here

1853
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:58,880
okay

1854
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:03,280
okay

1855
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:12,800
okay let's oops sorry sorry guys

1856
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:16,320
uh there's a check engine

1857
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:23,520
i love to show this to you in live not

1858
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:24,440
just the

1859
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:28,000
p0351 um let's give

1860
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,040
the car all the troubles

1861
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:34,800
and then we sold it we solved it live

1862
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,800
but unfortunately because of the

1863
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,719
lockdown you can do that

1864
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:41,840
so yeah

1865
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:45,040
i just made this video a sample video

1866
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:47,600
very basic guys you can do this you can

1867
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:50,320
you can all do this

1868
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:52,560
don't be afraid you're not gonna break

1869
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:55,280
anything you're not gonna break your ecu

1870
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:58,480
so this is just a simple misfire

1871
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:02,080
code okay

1872
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,880
all right so i've already erased it

1873
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:10,480
there we go the engine is running yeah

1874
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:15,440
okay then read codes again

1875
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:18,159
the vehicle has no fault calls already

1876
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:19,199
it's

1877
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:22,239
already resolved and the uh customer is

1878
01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:23,679
gonna pay me now

1879
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:27,840
that's the greatest part of it

1880
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:30,719
next is fuel injectors the purpose of

1881
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:32,880
the fuel injection system is to deliver

1882
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,000
fuel into the engine

1883
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
cylinders while precisely controlling

1884
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,440
the injection timing

1885
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:40,880
fuel atomization and other parameters

1886
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:44,560
so uh yeah this act as the syringe

1887
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:48,320
for for fuel so symptoms of bad or

1888
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:49,360
fading fuel

1889
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:52,960
injectors um hard start

1890
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:56,400
again poor engine idle again

1891
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:59,760
for performance for emission engine does

1892
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:00,400
not reach

1893
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:03,760
full rpm okay rough engine

1894
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:06,800
i rough engine performance surging

1895
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:10,800
cajot or bucking smoke from tailpipe

1896
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,840
so white smoke increased fuel

1897
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,120
consumption

1898
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:17,679
increased fuel consumption in terms of

1899
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:18,480
um

1900
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:21,679
if your injectors if your fuel injectors

1901
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:22,400
uh

1902
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,440
are failing it tends to open

1903
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:29,040
stay open and inject uh fuel

1904
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:31,920
even if the engine is shut off already

1905
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:32,639
so

1906
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:35,120
there are instances that it will flood

1907
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:36,719
the cylinder

1908
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:40,000
um it will really damage your car if

1909
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,159
if it happens so it happens a lot

1910
01:24:44,159 --> 01:24:45,920
if you don't take care of your fuel

1911
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:48,320
injectors okay

1912
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:53,760
so the generic dtc for that is p0170

1913
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:57,520
okay here's a sample of it

1914
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:01,360
right so a simple animation of

1915
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:04,159
a fuel injector inside the inside an

1916
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:06,480
engine

1917
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,520
so next is engine coolant temperature

1918
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:11,440
sensor and thermostat

1919
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:14,000
so coolant temperature sensors are used

1920
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,080
by the fuel management system to detect

1921
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:18,080
the engine's operating temperature

1922
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:20,080
depending on the sensor information the

1923
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:22,239
control units adapts the injection time

1924
01:25:22,239 --> 01:25:23,920
and firing angle to the operating

1925
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:24,880
conditions

1926
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,880
the sensor is a temperature sensor with

1927
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:29,600
a negative temperature coefficient

1928
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:32,639
a coolant temperature sensor cts

1929
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:34,400
is used to measure the temperature of

1930
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:37,120
the coolant mix in the coolant system

1931
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:39,600
giving an indication of how much heat

1932
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,760
the engine is giving up

1933
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:44,800
symptoms of a bad or failing ect sensor

1934
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:48,800
poor fuel economy because uh okay

1935
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,040
um i'm gonna explain it later stop on

1936
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:52,320
rich mixture

1937
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:55,600
black smoke from engine overheating

1938
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:59,440
engine check engine light comes on

1939
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:02,360
okay so uh the generic dtc for this is

1940
01:26:02,360 --> 01:26:04,159
p0118

1941
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:07,440
so uh it gets stuck in rich mixture

1942
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:08,239
because

1943
01:26:08,239 --> 01:26:12,239
some some defective ect sensor

1944
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:15,120
um they they give false information to

1945
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,639
the computer box

1946
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:19,199
um they tell the computer box the the

1947
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:20,080
engine is still

1948
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:23,199
on uh on a cold start

1949
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:25,520
even if your engine is already running

1950
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:26,639
an hour

1951
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:29,920
an hour ago it's stuck in the

1952
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:33,360
let's say 36 degrees temperature reading

1953
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:36,400
so the engine tends to you know um be

1954
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:39,679
on stock rich mixture or what i mean in

1955
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:42,080
rich mixture it it gives

1956
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:45,520
additional fuel to the engine oh we'll

1957
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:48,320
discuss about it later

1958
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:52,239
okay so let's see you smoke

1959
01:26:52,239 --> 01:26:55,199
puff the magic dragon um there's another

1960
01:26:55,199 --> 01:26:56,480
way to determine

1961
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:59,840
your engine's uh health conditions

1962
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:02,800
so if you see a blue gray smoke um

1963
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:03,600
that's caused

1964
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:06,719
by oil mixing inside

1965
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:09,760
together with the air and fuel well

1966
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:12,880
so there's there's a law that it should

1967
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:15,280
be air and fuel mixture only

1968
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:18,239
so if there's a third party which is the

1969
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:19,120
oil

1970
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:22,560
if it gets into if it gets into the

1971
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:24,719
combustion chamber also it will cause a

1972
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:26,000
blue gray smoke

1973
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,880
so it's very uh it will damage your

1974
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:29,679
engine

1975
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:33,280
soon enough um white gray smoke caused

1976
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,199
by a leaking head gasket

1977
01:27:35,199 --> 01:27:37,679
um like i said it should be air and fuel

1978
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:38,400
well

1979
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:42,000
but in this case if you see a grey smoke

1980
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,679
or whitish smoke

1981
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:47,760
um poland is already mixing

1982
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:52,239
in the engine so it's also dangerous

1983
01:27:52,239 --> 01:27:54,480
black smoke caused by a rich fuel

1984
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:55,600
mixture

1985
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:58,800
okay so a rich fuel mixture like i said

1986
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:01,120
additional fuel so if you see black

1987
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:03,280
smoke coming from intel pipes

1988
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:06,480
it means um it's already

1989
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:10,159
it's already burning fuel um above its

1990
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:14,719
above average okay

1991
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:18,320
oxygen sensors now um this part is

1992
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:21,520
uh as i'll say uh

1993
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:25,600
it's an advanced uh diagnostic uh

1994
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:28,639
topic but i'll try and and

1995
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:31,120
show it to you that you can also do it

1996
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:33,520
oxygen sensors are a critical component

1997
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:35,840
of the fuel and emission systems because

1998
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:38,320
they monitor the amount of oxygen

1999
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:40,239
in the exos and transmit that

2000
01:28:40,239 --> 01:28:42,480
information to the engine computer

2001
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,480
which adjusts the air to fuel ratio

2002
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:45,600
accordingly

2003
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:49,280
okay if the oxygen sensor is going bad

2004
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:51,520
the fuel delivery and fuel combustion

2005
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,520
systems will be thrown off

2006
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:56,320
if a bad oxygen sensor disrupts the

2007
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,480
air-to-fuel ratio mixture

2008
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,960
or too much fuel is injected into the

2009
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:01,760
engine

2010
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:04,239
your vehicle's gas mileage will be

2011
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:05,679
reduced

2012
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:07,760
symptoms of a bad or failing auto

2013
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,639
sensors or fuel economy

2014
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:14,560
um again check engine light comes on

2015
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:18,560
rough idle hard start accelerator pedal

2016
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:22,080
delay response or misfire um

2017
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:24,480
this one is very tricky guys the oxygen

2018
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,280
sensors

2019
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:27,840
sometimes it doesn't give a check engine

2020
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:28,960
light

2021
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:32,400
um sometimes uh it will uh

2022
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:35,520
it will keep the computer on the rich

2023
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:36,560
mixture

2024
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:39,520
so it will uh give false information to

2025
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:40,480
the computer

2026
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:42,880
if it's stuck on rich mixture what will

2027
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:44,400
happen is you will have if your

2028
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:50,480
poor fuel economy so the dtc for this is

2029
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:52,080
p0420

2030
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:55,440
a small illustration here of where to

2031
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:56,000
find

2032
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,199
these sensors commonly it is

2033
01:29:59,199 --> 01:30:01,600
found here before the catalytic

2034
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,880
converter

2035
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:06,320
so if you if you see your excess

2036
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:07,280
manifold

2037
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:10,639
there's a uh there's like a lollipop

2038
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:14,480
or uh or a small canister

2039
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:17,120
injected in the excess manifold and

2040
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:20,560
that's the oxygen sensors

2041
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:23,280
what goes around comes around or what we

2042
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:23,600
call

2043
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:25,840
in the automotive diagnostic is the

2044
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:28,159
bermuda triangle

2045
01:30:28,159 --> 01:30:31,840
so this is the auto sensor it gives

2046
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:34,960
it gives signal to the computer and then

2047
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:36,960
the computer will

2048
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:39,360
adjust injector pulse width based on

2049
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:42,560
calculated values including fuel trims

2050
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:46,320
also adjust spark timing and

2051
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:49,920
vct okay so uh

2052
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:52,239
space fuel uh possibly depends on

2053
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:53,920
computer instruction

2054
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:57,440
so um let's assume uh the oxygen sensor

2055
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:00,960
gives let's say uh more

2056
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:04,239
um let's say less air

2057
01:31:04,239 --> 01:31:06,400
to the computer box what will happen is

2058
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,400
the computer box will report the fuel

2059
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:09,520
injector

2060
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:12,639
um the computer will will

2061
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:16,080
send a signal that the oxygen sensor

2062
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:19,440
isn't um is not reporting

2063
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:22,960
more more air let's say it reported

2064
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:26,080
less air so what the injector will do is

2065
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,760
compensate for it

2066
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:31,280
so the injector will spray

2067
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:34,480
uh an additional amount of gasoline or

2068
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:37,199
fuel into the combustion chamber and so

2069
01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:38,960
on so

2070
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:42,840
say it's a sample of of that

2071
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:45,520
cycle

2072
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:48,800
so uh auto sensor voltage reading

2073
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:52,159
um okay

2074
01:31:52,159 --> 01:31:56,000
uh there's a an oxygen sensor will

2075
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,280
typically generate

2076
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:59,920
up to about 0.9 volts when the fuel

2077
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:01,440
mixture is reached

2078
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:03,520
and there is little unburned oxygen in

2079
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:06,159
the exhaust when the mixture is lean

2080
01:32:06,159 --> 01:32:08,400
the sensor's output voltage will drop

2081
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:09,679
down to about

2082
01:32:09,679 --> 01:32:12,719
0.1 volts so um

2083
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:15,840
true oxygen sensor reading guys it

2084
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:16,560
really

2085
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:20,639
helps a lot of uh diagnostics i mean if

2086
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:23,280
you if you can master this auto sensor

2087
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:23,920
reading

2088
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:27,840
you will you will have the advantage of

2089
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:32,639
isolating a misfire symptoms

2090
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:35,920
um okay so

2091
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:38,800
yeah there's a sample of auto sensor

2092
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,400
voltage reading here

2093
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:44,480
um unfortunately i can show an animated

2094
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:47,760
an animated version of this

2095
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:50,960
uh it oscillates it has an oscillation

2096
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:52,840
here

2097
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:55,920
so what is that

2098
01:32:55,920 --> 01:33:00,239
i don't know i can hear chats

2099
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:05,280
okay so here is a cold start warm up

2100
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:05,760
face

2101
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:08,719
so i'm gonna play a sample video again

2102
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:10,080
on how to

2103
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:13,679
read an oxygen sensor

2104
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:22,400
okay oh the engine is

2105
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:26,239
is very cold so it's a cold start

2106
01:33:26,239 --> 01:33:29,280
36 degrees the or the normal operating

2107
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:31,600
temperature should be 95 degrees up to

2108
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:34,159
100

2109
01:33:34,840 --> 01:33:37,840
okay

2110
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:45,520
sir jeremy are you there uh can you hear

2111
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:47,040
me sir

2112
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:49,840
yes yes we're here

2113
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:58,800
yes it is okay thank you sir jeremy

2114
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:01,440
okay sir jeremy thank you so as you can

2115
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:02,320
see here the

2116
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:06,639
voltage 3d it plays it it plays from 0.1

2117
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:08,480
to 0.9

2118
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:11,360
at the minimum

2119
01:34:13,199 --> 01:34:15,600
okay i don't know why i clicked the

2120
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,280
right button there

2121
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:20,560
sorry for the poor video here

2122
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:24,320
okay what i mean checking here

2123
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:28,639
okay let's go back to the way

2124
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:33,840
right sir

2125
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:38,639
all right so let's just focus here

2126
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:42,800
the numbers here okay

2127
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:45,360
so uh the oh the o2 sensor reading

2128
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:48,199
should be between

2129
01:34:48,199 --> 01:34:49,520
0.10.9

2130
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:51,760
but i advise a good oxygen sensor

2131
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:52,960
reading is

2132
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:56,239
between as long as it doesn't reach

2133
01:34:56,239 --> 01:34:59,920
one volt 1.0 and above reading

2134
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:02,880
it means it's it's abnormal um there's

2135
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:04,960
something wrong with your oxygen sensor

2136
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:05,679
when

2137
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:08,880
when this this value reaches one which

2138
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:09,280
is

2139
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:12,639
one volt so

2140
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:17,679
in this situation it's pretty normal

2141
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:21,679
okay take note of that guys um if it

2142
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:22,800
shoot up

2143
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:26,159
one 1.0 volt there's something wrong

2144
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:26,880
with it

2145
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:29,840
better check the electricals first the

2146
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:30,880
connectors

2147
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:34,159
or if all else fails um your

2148
01:35:34,159 --> 01:35:38,239
auto sensor is already uh defective

2149
01:35:38,239 --> 01:35:41,679
okay so road test

2150
01:35:41,679 --> 01:35:44,239
in this clip i think i'm having a hard

2151
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:45,119
time

2152
01:35:45,119 --> 01:35:48,320
recording it while driving

2153
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:51,440
recording while driving don't try this

2154
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:52,639
at home

2155
01:35:52,639 --> 01:35:56,000
okay so here we can

2156
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,320
see the voltage reading of the oxygen

2157
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:00,719
sensor 0.1 0.8

2158
01:36:00,719 --> 01:36:03,520
it's oscillating let's just imagine it's

2159
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:06,239
oscillating

2160
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:12,000
okay hello there mr nissan and

2161
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,280
mcdonald's

2162
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:18,320
all right okay

2163
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,639
so it's oscillating and it's not stuck

2164
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:21,520
on a

2165
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:24,800
certain value so if it's

2166
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:28,000
stuck in let's say it's stuck in 0.740

2167
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,040
volts

2168
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:31,360
um that means the computer isn't getting

2169
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:34,320
any information from your oxygen sensor

2170
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:36,639
and what will happen if your oxygen

2171
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:38,480
oxygen sensor has

2172
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:41,600
is already defective um like i said

2173
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:44,239
uh in my experience in my customers

2174
01:36:44,239 --> 01:36:45,600
experience

2175
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:48,960
um there's an instance a super delayed

2176
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:50,880
throttle response

2177
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:54,239
what i mean is she stepped on the

2178
01:36:54,239 --> 01:36:57,119
gas pedal for about three to five

2179
01:36:57,119 --> 01:36:58,320
seconds

2180
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:00,480
and then just that's just the time when

2181
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:01,920
the engine already

2182
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:05,440
responded so there's a five second delay

2183
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:08,560
imagine that if you're in an uphill

2184
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:11,920
in an uphill environment and your

2185
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:15,520
car isn't responding what will happen is

2186
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:18,159
the tendency you will you will crash the

2187
01:37:18,159 --> 01:37:20,320
car behind you

2188
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:23,440
so uh yeah uh i'll discuss it in detail

2189
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:25,040
next time maybe

2190
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:29,920
so i'll just uh continue the video

2191
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:35,280
oh let's uh talk about the sudden

2192
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:36,320
unintended

2193
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:40,639
acceleration the issue next time in my

2194
01:37:40,639 --> 01:37:41,660
if

2195
01:37:41,660 --> 01:37:44,000
[Music]

2196
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,280
if we still have time

2197
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:50,560
okay there we go

2198
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:52,560
it's uh let's imagine it's oscillating

2199
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:55,520
it's yeah

2200
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:59,679
okay so it's functioning our auto

2201
01:37:59,679 --> 01:38:02,480
sensors are good okay

2202
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:05,360
next topic alongside oxygen sensors the

2203
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:06,480
fuel trims

2204
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:09,040
so there are two types short-term and

2205
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:11,280
short-term and long-term

2206
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:14,239
um the short-term fuel trim refers to

2207
01:38:14,239 --> 01:38:16,320
immediate changes in fuel occurring

2208
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:18,239
several times per second

2209
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:20,560
the long term are driven by the short

2210
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:21,760
term fuel trims

2211
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:23,520
so let's just say the long term is just

2212
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:25,360
the average um

2213
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:28,239
it's the total of the short terms okay

2214
01:38:28,239 --> 01:38:31,440
um let's not complicate the definition

2215
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:34,000
long term refers to changes in short

2216
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:34,480
term

2217
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:37,360
but averaged over a longer period of

2218
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:38,639
time

2219
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:41,360
so what is the normal reading assuming

2220
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:42,560
that the engine is in

2221
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:44,960
excellent mechanical condition and that

2222
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:45,840
all sensors

2223
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:48,639
implicated in metering both intake air

2224
01:38:48,639 --> 01:38:49,679
and fuel

2225
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:51,840
short-term fuel trim values should

2226
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:53,360
generally be between

2227
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:56,960
positive 10. here in our sample table

2228
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:57,360
here

2229
01:38:57,360 --> 01:39:00,880
positive 10 and negative 10 when the

2230
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:03,360
engine is running at a steady speed

2231
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:06,159
so it should it should play around minus

2232
01:39:06,159 --> 01:39:06,639
10

2233
01:39:06,639 --> 01:39:09,600
that means minus 10 subtracting fuel and

2234
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:10,560
between

2235
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:13,520
plus 10 which is adding fuel so it

2236
01:39:13,520 --> 01:39:16,080
really plays there it doesn't uh

2237
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:19,199
stay here steady on a certain number

2238
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:22,239
so how to interpret if it's on rich

2239
01:39:22,239 --> 01:39:25,360
rich mix or lean mix if it's on

2240
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:28,639
rich mix it adds fuel

2241
01:39:28,639 --> 01:39:32,320
here if it's on lean mix

2242
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:35,520
it subtracts people okay

2243
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:37,760
so that's the importance of knowing how

2244
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:40,159
to read fuel trims

2245
01:39:40,159 --> 01:39:43,920
so uh there's a short video of

2246
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:47,360
this i'll just play for you guys and

2247
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:51,440
discuss a little bit of the fuel trims

2248
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:58,159
okay um

2249
01:39:58,159 --> 01:40:03,040
i think it's not clear enough here

2250
01:40:03,199 --> 01:40:06,639
okay oh why am i in ignition time in

2251
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:07,679
advance

2252
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:11,600
wait wait guys there we go

2253
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:14,159
alongside the fuel trim reading is of

2254
01:40:14,159 --> 01:40:15,199
course our

2255
01:40:15,199 --> 01:40:18,719
good friend oxygen sensor

2256
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:24,159
so the rule here is you play it between

2257
01:40:24,159 --> 01:40:24,639
uh

2258
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:28,159
negative 10 and positive 10.

2259
01:40:28,159 --> 01:40:31,440
so the numbers are are good

2260
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:35,199
showing good results it doesn't exceed

2261
01:40:35,199 --> 01:40:38,320
the average okay negative five over

2262
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:40,159
there

2263
01:40:40,159 --> 01:40:43,920
short term okay

2264
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:47,360
what am i doing here okay

2265
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:54,799
all right positive three and um

2266
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:58,560
yeah so we have a good

2267
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:01,760
fuel trim readings i increased the rpm

2268
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:04,159
to 2000

2269
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:06,560
or make sure you are in neutral geyser

2270
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:08,639
make sure you are in neutral or parked

2271
01:41:08,639 --> 01:41:12,400
before you accelerate those pedals

2272
01:41:14,639 --> 01:41:17,760
okay so the long term is the average is

2273
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:21,119
on lean side which is the minus 4.7

2274
01:41:21,119 --> 01:41:22,560
percent

2275
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:26,400
so it's subtracting a 4.7 percent in

2276
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,639
total fuel consumption

2277
01:41:28,639 --> 01:41:30,880
okay

2278
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:43,360
okay so here's a graphical

2279
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:46,560
view point of view

2280
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:50,719
oh so this clip has the oscillation

2281
01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:52,560
sample let's just imagine this is an

2282
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:55,040
oscillation waveform

2283
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:57,199
the oxygen sensor is the red ones so

2284
01:41:57,199 --> 01:41:59,600
it's oscillating normally

2285
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:03,360
it doesn't get stuck here in 0.6

2286
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:07,440
to 0.9 or 1.0 volt so it's pretty normal

2287
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,040
it's oscillating

2288
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:12,239
between 0.1 and 0.9

2289
01:42:12,239 --> 01:42:14,639
and our short field trim the black the

2290
01:42:14,639 --> 01:42:16,400
black lines here

2291
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:19,040
are making a super mario stairs so

2292
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:19,600
meaning

2293
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:22,719
uh it's operating normally

2294
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:25,040
okay

2295
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:29,520
so yeah the magic number is minus 10 and

2296
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:30,320
plus 10

2297
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:34,560
so um it doesn't exceed those numbers so

2298
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:37,440
meaning it's all good your fuel system

2299
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:38,480
is good

2300
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:41,760
fuel filters are clean correct a few

2301
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:42,639
well

2302
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:47,360
everything is normal okay oh i saw a

2303
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:50,639
one uh negative seven there wait i think

2304
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:53,520
i saw something there

2305
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:58,400
oh there's a negative seven also

2306
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:02,800
i better check it out later or tomorrow

2307
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:05,840
i miss that one okay

2308
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:09,199
so that's it guys

2309
01:43:09,199 --> 01:43:12,960
you can do it um happy wrenching

2310
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:16,080
i hope you learned a thing or two uh

2311
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:18,719
in this talk um it's kind of different

2312
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:19,119
from

2313
01:43:19,119 --> 01:43:22,159
our cybersec uh talks but

2314
01:43:22,159 --> 01:43:24,560
it's also part of the automotive

2315
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:26,159
technology so

2316
01:43:26,159 --> 01:43:29,840
yeah um you can do it hyper engine guys

2317
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:33,199
thank you to sergey turla sir dax

2318
01:43:33,199 --> 01:43:35,840
sir jamie for hosting and for inviting

2319
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:38,639
us here in root con 14.

2320
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:42,400
so thank you guys

2321
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:45,920
thanks uh thanks jay uh for providing us

2322
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:46,960
a walk through

2323
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:50,239
on how our car functions

2324
01:43:50,239 --> 01:43:52,560
and well i guess the positive takeaway

2325
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,080
from this talk would be

2326
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:57,440
uh at least for my end my opinion would

2327
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:58,639
be

2328
01:43:58,639 --> 01:44:01,760
learning how it works so would it be

2329
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:03,280
able to know

2330
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:05,520
what would be the manifestation of the

2331
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:07,440
pattern was hacking or what would be the

2332
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:09,440
results of the fan was hacking

2333
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:12,159
uh that we're going to perform say

2334
01:44:12,159 --> 01:44:13,600
flatten the engine

2335
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:15,600
uh how would we know that we're flooding

2336
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:16,960
the engine

2337
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:18,480
how would you know whether it's working

2338
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:20,719
or not uh

2339
01:44:20,719 --> 01:44:23,280
definitely it all boils down to what

2340
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:24,639
would manifest if

2341
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:28,239
ever uh we input those codes

2342
01:44:28,239 --> 01:44:31,760
uh or those kind of signals so

2343
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:34,000
thank you for helping us understand the

2344
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,840
the basic functions and the fundamentals

2345
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:36,320
of

2346
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:39,199
how har or combustion engine functions

2347
01:44:39,199 --> 01:44:39,600
are

2348
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:43,199
really helpful yes sir to add that as

2349
01:44:43,199 --> 01:44:43,600
well

2350
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:47,040
uh so what you can see there's an obd2

2351
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:49,520
scanner that

2352
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:52,719
jsellis actually presented if you if you

2353
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:55,199
hook it up with another wire

2354
01:44:55,199 --> 01:44:58,960
and you have your own canvas tool

2355
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:01,440
that allows you to dump the data in real

2356
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:03,760
time you can actually reverse engineer

2357
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:07,280
what's being uh thrown by the uh

2358
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:09,600
ob2 scanners you can actually do a man

2359
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:11,520
in the middle attack

2360
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:14,960
and in fact um from what you can see

2361
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:16,000
from the presentation

2362
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:20,080
that jase ellis or julian's ellis

2363
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:23,440
have given you get to know the attack

2364
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:24,560
surfaces

2365
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:27,920
of the car itself

2366
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:30,800
as well and you might know uh you might

2367
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:32,960
get an idea on how to fix

2368
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:34,719
the things that uh that you're gonna do

2369
01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:37,280
with your car so that's why we

2370
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:40,719
um some people may may not see it as

2371
01:45:40,719 --> 01:45:43,199
related to cyber security but as a car

2372
01:45:43,199 --> 01:45:43,840
hacker

2373
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:47,840
myself i see it that it's really uh

2374
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:51,840
it touches um not just the tip of an

2375
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:54,080
iceberg of what car hacking is

2376
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:56,639
but you know unleash some of the things

2377
01:45:56,639 --> 01:45:59,840
that you do for car hacking

2378
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:02,960
all right thank you for that sure with

2379
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:04,480
you on that one jay

2380
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:07,520
yeah yeah uh thanks thank you uh

2381
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:10,719
jesus for uh providing the talk uh

2382
01:46:10,719 --> 01:46:13,520
too much thought were put into it uh we

2383
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:16,560
really appreciate the hard work

2384
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:20,239
all right so i know we're

2385
01:46:20,239 --> 01:46:23,600
currently we're on uh we've been over

2386
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:25,360
for about 20 minutes but no worries

2387
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:26,080
about that

2388
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:29,199
uh i i

2389
01:46:29,199 --> 01:46:31,440
move on forward with our next speaker if

2390
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:32,560
you guys don't mind

2391
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:35,840
uh yeah i'm cutting a bit of the air

2392
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:36,880
time here

2393
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:39,280
uh all right so let me properly

2394
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:41,040
introduce our next speaker

2395
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:44,239
uh he is an experienced cartooner

2396
01:46:44,239 --> 01:46:46,560
an enthusiast for more than 10 years he

2397
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:48,080
is also a computer engineer

2398
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:51,360
and also an aircraft mechanic hopefully

2399
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:53,199
he's not putting wings on our cars

2400
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:56,960
after a stop but

2401
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:58,960
looking forward to this it sounds very

2402
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:00,880
interesting he's currently a cyber

2403
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:02,800
security consultant

2404
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:06,080
his interests are hardware hacking and

2405
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:09,920
iot and lt over ot and penetration

2406
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:10,880
testing

2407
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:14,159
so he's been to root con i believe last

2408
01:47:14,159 --> 01:47:15,040
year

2409
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:17,920
uh where he was able to find jay torla

2410
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:19,600
in the car hacking village

2411
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:22,880
and here comes him uh

2412
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:25,199
ladies and gentlemen help me welcome

sergey torilla so should i begin my

2419
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:51,840
presentation or yes please please do so

2420
01:48:15,199 --> 01:48:18,719
so everyone you see me sir j turlock do

2421
01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:19,679
you see my screen

2422
01:48:19,679 --> 01:48:24,000
sir jamie yes uh the screen is clear

2423
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:27,199
okay just hold on

2424
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:33,840
are we

2425
01:48:54,320 --> 01:49:01,840
wait i'm having problem hold on

2426
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:15,840
hold on guys

2427
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:57,840
okay

2428
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:11,920
you

2429
01:50:37,199 --> 01:50:40,880
okay uh hello everyone uh

2430
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:44,480
do you see my screen right now yes

2431
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:48,000
yes sir so let's begin

2432
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:52,080
so i am jeffy of jc detroit so i've been

2433
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:54,880
tuning for around more than 10 years

2434
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:58,400
so i do

2435
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:02,480
car racing drug racing circuit facing

2436
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:06,080
yeah so that's it so let's begin

2437
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:08,880
so a modern way how to tweak your ride

2438
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:09,599
so

2439
01:51:09,599 --> 01:51:12,719
before before uh

2440
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:15,920
as you can see here uh before i mean

2441
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:18,560
nowadays all vehicles and motorcycles

2442
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:20,239
are switching to

2443
01:51:20,239 --> 01:51:24,239
electronic fuel injected

2444
01:51:24,239 --> 01:51:27,119
they are they want to achieve more power

2445
01:51:27,119 --> 01:51:27,599
and

2446
01:51:27,599 --> 01:51:31,199
better fuel efficiency not like the

2447
01:51:31,199 --> 01:51:34,560
carburetor the carburetor contains

2448
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:37,440
jet that will push gas into a combustion

2449
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:38,080
chamber

2450
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:40,639
and the amount of fuel that can be

2451
01:51:40,639 --> 01:51:41,760
flowed through

2452
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:44,800
the jets depend completely on the amount

2453
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:46,719
of air that can be pulled into

2454
01:51:46,719 --> 01:51:49,440
a carburetor venture so that's the old

2455
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:51,119
traditional carburetor

2456
01:51:51,119 --> 01:51:53,599
now uh almost all of the cars are

2457
01:51:53,599 --> 01:51:54,880
running in the

2458
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:58,719
uh efi so

2459
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:04,719
so what does the efi

2460
01:52:04,719 --> 01:52:09,280
what does the efi fuel injection

2461
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:12,639
the fuel injection is a system

2462
01:52:12,639 --> 01:52:15,440
of compress of a complex offset of

2463
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:16,000
electronic

2464
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,360
sensors the pull supply where

2465
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:22,719
the here in these slides uh

2466
01:52:22,719 --> 01:52:26,159
we have numbers so the one is the

2467
01:52:26,159 --> 01:52:30,400
fuel pressure which monitors the the

2468
01:52:30,400 --> 01:52:33,599
pressure of the fuel rail and then two

2469
01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:34,320
is the

2470
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:37,360
uh p1 rail uh which

2471
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:41,040
is a fuel rail is a two being uh

2472
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:43,760
which takes fuel to the injector and the

2473
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:45,360
third item here

2474
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:49,119
uh the fuel injectors so

2475
01:52:49,119 --> 01:52:52,239
and the port item is the ecu

2476
01:52:52,239 --> 01:52:56,159
or the electronic control

2477
01:52:56,159 --> 01:52:59,040
ecm or ecu or the electronic control

2478
01:52:59,040 --> 01:52:59,840
module

2479
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:02,880
or unit so here

2480
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:05,920
we have the electronic fuel pump

2481
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:09,280
so it goes like this from the fuel tank

2482
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:13,599
uh the the

2483
01:53:13,599 --> 01:53:17,280
sorry the fuel pump uh drives the fuel

2484
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:21,760
going to the uh fuel rail

2485
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:25,520
while uh while the fuel

2486
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:28,880
fuel pressure monitors the pressure of

2487
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:30,719
the fuel inside the

2488
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:33,760
the fuel rail then the ecu

2489
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:37,040
sends signals to the injector on

2490
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:39,760
how amount of fuel it will be in

2491
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:41,760
injected to the combustion chamber

2492
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:45,760
it works like that so

2493
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:49,599
okay let's go to the next slide

2494
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:55,520
so our next slide is the electronic

2495
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:56,800
computer you need

2496
01:53:56,800 --> 01:54:00,400
so the ecu inputs from the vehicle

2497
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:03,679
uh sensors like crankshaft sensors and

2498
01:54:03,679 --> 01:54:05,679
uh camshaft sensors compute the

2499
01:54:05,679 --> 01:54:07,679
information using program that has been

2500
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:08,080
installed

2501
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:11,360
into the ecu so here

2502
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:15,440
uh the ecu the ecu controls the amount

2503
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:17,840
of fuel to be sprayed to the injectors

2504
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:21,040
the ecu also knows what is happening on

2505
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:22,719
the car

2506
01:54:22,719 --> 01:54:25,679
if there is a problem uh a check engine

2507
01:54:25,679 --> 01:54:26,639
light will appear

2508
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:30,960
on the dashboard so if you are if

2509
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:33,119
also if one of the sensors are not

2510
01:54:33,119 --> 01:54:34,159
working

2511
01:54:34,159 --> 01:54:36,080
the check engine light will appear on

2512
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:37,599
the dash panel

2513
01:54:37,599 --> 01:54:40,639
so uh how we

2514
01:54:40,639 --> 01:54:43,040
gonna check this one if you put the key

2515
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:47,760
on the i don't know
