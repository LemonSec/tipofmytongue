4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,559
today i am going to talk about

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,400
operational technology ot

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,719
and its cyber security security

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:15,759
mechanisms

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,400
like ot monitoring solution what are the

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,199
challenges

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,920
in deployment of ot monitoring solution

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,600
and how blockchain technology

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,599
can solve the problem of ot monitoring

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,320
solution deployment

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,200
so who are we i am asif amit khan and my

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,200
area of expertise includes operational

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,040
technology cyber security

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,360
cyber threat intelligence and digital

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,920
forensics and incident response

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,160
i also run my own platform on linkedin

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,719
and twitter with the name otisp

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,120
ot threat information sharing platform

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,719
so you can follow us for more

23
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,760
otics related news and updates

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,920
today i have my friend graham deep singh

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,440
janna with me

26
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,680
his interest lies in iot pen testing

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,000
hardware security and firmware analysis

28
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,200
introduction to operational technology

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,119
the endpoints in iit environment

30
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,560
is desktops servers laptops etc

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,799
but the endpoints in ot environment is

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,320
field devices

33
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,439
just like itn points it collects inputs

34
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,880
processes it and gives output these ot

35
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,560
field devices like sensors

36
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,759
actuators etc collects real-time data

37
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,040
and send it to controllers like plc rtu

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,960
which can be thought of as industrial

39
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,320
cpu designed

40
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,360
for specific purpose these controllers

41
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,240
are programmed

42
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,119
to get specific output based on inputs

43
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,520
provided by the field devices

44
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,840
so we can say it's a control loop

45
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,680
wherein we collect data

46
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,320
and send it to the controller for output

47
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,360
take an example of

48
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,000
air conditioner temperature sensor gives

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
input to the controller and based on

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,360
temperature defined

51
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,079
it takes decision whether to on the ac

52
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,399
or switch off the ac

53
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,079
in order to manage and view the

54
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,560
controllers we have human machine

55
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,200
interface namely hmi consoles

56
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,120
where you can configure and govern

57
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,800
controllers

58
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,720
suppose we are having manufacturing

59
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,560
plant of three floors

60
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,080
and in all floors hmi is installed

61
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,959
when we manage and govern multiple hmis

62
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,720
within the plant environment of

63
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,879
large continuous processing facility at

64
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,160
one place

65
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,959
we call it a dcs distributed control

66
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,319
systems

67
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,280
if we manage and control same operations

68
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,000
remotely

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,720
rather than on-site we call it scada

70
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,400
supervisory control and data acquisition

71
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,640
these hardware and software working

72
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,519
together

73
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,840
to achieve industrial objectives is

74
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,760
known as industrial control system

75
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,160
ics lastly ot refers to the computing

76
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,560
systems used to manage the whole

77
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,159
industrial operations

78
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,599
ot is more generic term than scada dcs

79
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,238
and ics

80
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,519
in order to understand the ot

81
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,239
environment a conceptual model is widely

82
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:14,879
used

83
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,959
namely purdue enterprise reference

84
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,040
architecture pera

85
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,959
it is same like osi model for

86
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,360
understanding network layers

87
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,319
purdue model contains six levels wherein

88
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,720
level 0 to level 3 considered

89
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,000
as ot environment and level 4 to level 5

90
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,360
considered as it environment level 0

91
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,920
contains

92
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,640
field devices which collects inputs and

93
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,799
send it to level 1 devices which are

94
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,400
controllers

95
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,040
level 2 contains hmis for managing the

96
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,040
controllers

97
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,599
level 3 contains dcs and scada

98
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,560
appliances

99
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,799
depending upon the network and design of

100
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,879
the utility

101
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,680
on other hand level 4 and level 5 are

102
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,280
business and corporate side of the

103
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,640
utility

104
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,599
the most critical levels are level 3 and

105
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,959
level 4

106
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,920
as they converge it and ot which we call

107
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:15,120
it ot convergence

108
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,880
why ot security why we are doing this

109
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,400
industry 4.0 and industry 5.0 refers to

110
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,320
a new phase of industrial revolution

111
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,160
that focuses heavily on

112
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,880
interconnectivity automation machine

113
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,639
learning and real-time data

114
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,160
the increase in connectivity of

115
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,759
industrial control system to the

116
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,320
internet has opened a new threat vector

117
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,560
furthermore last decade has shown

118
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,639
prominent attacks on ics and ot

119
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,759
environment

120
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,520
usage of commercial off-the-shelf

121
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,800
products squads

122
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,199
can be obtained and operated at a lower

123
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,120
cost as compared to custom built

124
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,080
software

125
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,160
but software security is a serious risk

126
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,880
of using quartz product and software

127
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,520
integration of iot in ot which we call

128
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,720
iiot

129
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,520
iot sensors and actuators are having

130
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,759
direct connectivity to the cloud via fog

131
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,280
and edge computing layers

132
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,960
therefore provides a gateway for an

133
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,400
attacker

134
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,320
enterprise and process control network

135
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,000
connectivity

136
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,320
it related attacks can easily pivots

137
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,320
into process control network

138
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,039
all the it attack surface becomes ot

139
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,199
attack surface then

140
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,919
impact of ot security breach is always

141
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:24,960
greater than i.t

142
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,000
security since the factors of human

143
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,880
environmental and safety issues are

144
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,680
there

145
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,000
apart from these common factors there

146
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,120
are other factors

147
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,520
which makes this system vulnerable for

148
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,400
instance

149
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
outdated equipments proprietary

150
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,960
protocols outdated asset inventory

151
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,120
there is no configuration tracking and

152
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,120
business side is having no visibility

153
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,759
into ot networks

154
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,800
common myths operational technology and

155
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,080
its cyber security

156
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,080
is in the early stages and gradually

157
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,120
evolving

158
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,800
however there are some typical

159
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
misconception between the people working

160
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,479
in industrial automation when it comes

161
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,160
to cyber security

162
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,919
in this slide we will discuss about

163
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,560
those common misconceptions and myth

164
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,160
we will start with the first one which

165
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,880
is we have a firewall and ideas deployed

166
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,800
but they don't care about the rules and

167
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,319
signatures

168
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,440
second is we are air-gapped if we

169
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,800
consider the fact

170
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,120
that okay if you are air gapped the

171
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,039
traffic from the business network will

172
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:25,600
not go

173
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,560
into the ot network but what if someone

174
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,080
inside the ot network

175
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,840
plug the usb will you able to detect

176
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,479
that third one

177
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,000
we have sis and safety devices deployed

178
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,880
why hacker will target us but ideally

179
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,560
they don't understand it's a critical

180
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,319
infrastructure that impacts

181
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,199
the nation's economy then we are not

182
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,360
connected to business network

183
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,960
if you are not connected to the business

184
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,759
network they think okay we are secure

185
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,319
and there is a very common misconception

186
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,160
which lies in the fact they think iit

187
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,440
security

188
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,160
is more important than ot security but

189
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,759
idly it should be noted

190
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,479
that ot security is always critical than

191
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,840
i.t security

192
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,840
since human safety and environmental

193
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:16,240
factors are involved

194
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,039
monitoring solutions most of the times

195
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,960
referred as ot sock

196
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,880
generally these solutions provide two

197
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,880
modes of monitoring namely passive and

198
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,639
active mode of monitoring

199
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,960
in passive mode it captures all the

200
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,560
pcaps analyzes it

201
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,639
and gives all the information to the

202
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,960
server this information includes

203
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,759
vulnerabilities assets information

204
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,599
firmware version etc

205
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,680
in active mode a proper scan is

206
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,080
performed as per the policy defined

207
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,240
wherein we actually sends the packet to

208
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,440
the remorse host

209
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,479
in order to find useful information this

210
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,400
solution provide many benefits

211
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,960
like 24 7 continuous monitoring of ot

212
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,759
assets

213
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,680
other benefits includes vulnerability

214
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,919
management and of course the coverage

215
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,479
and the information of the ot assets at

216
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,479
the enterprise level

217
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,240
generally this solution get easily

218
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,720
integrated to the enterprise sim and

219
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,800
soar for efficient automation and

220
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,479
incident response

221
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,639
there are many vendors in the market

222
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,240
some of them are shown in this slide

223
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,800
in this slide we will discuss about the

224
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,759
deployment of ot monitoring solution

225
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,680
we have taken a reference of nozomi

226
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,919
solution where deployment is presented

227
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,159
with mapped purdue levels

228
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,240
typically span or mirror port is

229
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,200
configured at

230
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
layer 2 switches and sensors are

231
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,479
deployed

232
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,039
these sensors collects information based

233
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,080
on configuration

234
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,040
and send it to layer 3 servers which is

235
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,320
a management console

236
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,600
of ot monitoring solution these multiple

237
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,399
plant wise

238
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,800
management console on other hand is

239
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,720
connected to the centralized management

240
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,959
console of ot monitoring solution at

241
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,320
layer 4.

242
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,240
the integration of ot monitoring

243
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,720
solution and enterprise siem

244
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,920
occurs at layer 4 and layer 5 depending

245
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,760
upon the architecture

246
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,920
this is a common deployment technique

247
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,080
used in majority of the ot monitoring

248
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,839
solution available in the market

249
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,560
challenges in ot monitoring solution

250
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,760
deployment

251
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,839
there are many associated challenges

252
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,600
with the deployment of ot monitoring

253
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,720
solutions

254
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,800
when we deploy these solutions we have

255
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
to construct a parallel network

256
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,360
which integrates ot soft to it

257
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,399
environment

258
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,320
this becomes overhead an additional

259
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,519
thing for experts working at plant site

260
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,600
other reasons include maintenance and

261
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,200
responsibilities

262
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,640
by integrating ot soft to enterprise sim

263
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,320
we are increasing the connectivity of

264
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,279
layer 3 and layer 4 as per purdue model

265
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,680
if not secured properly it becomes a

266
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,120
threat vector

267
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,959
as we are deploying the product of third

268
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,800
party to our environment

269
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
there is always a risk of information

270
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,079
disclosure

271
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,240
as stock as a service is rapidly

272
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,240
increasing third party are having the

273
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,920
access to the ot sock

274
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,200
we can never trust outsiders identity

275
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,480
and access management

276
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,320
privilege identity management and

277
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
privilege access management for ot

278
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,680
monitoring solution should be

279
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,519
implemented properly

280
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,000
remote access for troubleshooting etc

281
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
sometimes allow an attacker to gain

282
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,680
access remotely to ot

283
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,800
assets keeping aside the above mentioned

284
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,440
points

285
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,160
management of integrated it ot shock is

286
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,920
full of difficulties

287
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,920
ot teams doesn't know what to do with

288
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,120
the incidents

289
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,200
while iit team doesn't know how to close

290
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,240
the incidents

291
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,640
and provide in-depth playbooks to the ot

292
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,600
team

293
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,079
there is a gap between it and ot team

294
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,320
when it comes to cyber security

295
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,279
ot team focuses on safety and it team

296
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,800
focuses on security

297
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,440
what is blockchain blockchain is digital

298
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,120
decentralized technology

299
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,040
which maintains a record of all

300
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,000
transactions over a peer-to-peer network

301
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,560
it reduces vulnerability and increases

302
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,880
transparency as every node in blockchain

303
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,560
maintains its record

304
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,760
of transactions after every transaction

305
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,320
a record is broadcasted to all the peers

306
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,800
so that they can update their record

307
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,880
everyone is having information about

308
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,279
each other it is distributed and not

309
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,279
controlled by a single entity

310
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,279
the name blockchain is termed because

311
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,200
each group of transaction

312
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,680
on a blockchain is referred to as block

313
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,920
and each block is combined in order to

314
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,120
form a chain

315
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,680
in simple words we can say it is a

316
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,600
linked list kind of data structure

317
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,480
except of pointers as in blockchain we

318
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,040
have hash for the node connectivity

319
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,279
the first node or block contains the

320
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,399
configuration for

321
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,279
whole database it is known as genesis

322
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,079
block

323
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,240
therefore configuration of genesis block

324
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,839
should be done securely with good

325
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,120
ciphers and key length

326
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,639
so what are the blockchain concepts the

327
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,720
concept of blockchain are many but here

328
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,639
we are only focusing on the concepts

329
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,560
that we have used in this ot monitoring

330
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,519
solution

331
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,920
some of them are the concept of

332
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,040
decentralization if you are

333
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,959
creating a blockchain environment you

334
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,360
are creating a decentralized environment

335
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,279
which in fact give you a benefit like

336
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,760
there will be no single point of failure

337
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,920
and the benefit of high availability

338
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,079
then there is a concept of transparency

339
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,839
if there is a transparency then again

340
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,200
there will be no man in the middle

341
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,320
attack

342
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,560
third is immutability the database

343
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,839
cannot be tempered and deleted once

344
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,839
created

345
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,920
blockchain use cases blockchain is

346
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,720
considered

347
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,800
as one of the notable revolution in a

348
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,880
field of financial technology

349
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,360
but blockchain applicability go far

350
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,680
beyond cryptocurrency and bitcoin

351
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,440
there are numerous use cases of

352
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,600
blockchain we have rounded up

353
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,440
some of the top use cases in the field

354
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,040
of cyber security

355
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,440
in this slide we will delve into the

356
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,519
list of blockchain use cases

357
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,000
and we will start with bitcoin and

358
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
decentralized currency

359
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,440
we all know this then governance

360
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,360
in governance blockchain is used for

361
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,519
audit tracking report tracking and fraud

362
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,200
detection

363
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,360
in identity and access management

364
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,279
blockchain is widely used

365
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,480
in asset tracking in data management

366
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,279
in iot it provides privacy which is a

367
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,120
key issue in iot

368
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,440
it is applicable in digital forensics

369
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,040
for robust and tamper-proof

370
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,920
artifact collections it is applicable on

371
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,600
cyber threat intelligence

372
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,079
for secure collection and sharing of ti

373
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,040
feeds

374
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,279
and lastly decentralized applications

375
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,880
let's talk about applicability of

376
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
blockchain in ot monitoring and what are

377
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,800
the key benefits blockchain can provide

378
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,360
us

379
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,360
some of them are decentralized network

380
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,560
and application

381
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,560
via which we can give secure access to

382
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,680
third party vendors

383
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,760
integrators relevant iit and ot

384
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,600
stakeholders

385
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,680
we are having the benefit of immutable

386
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,079
database there is no tampering

387
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,040
there is a consensus there is a privacy

388
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,720
blockchain can act as an intermediate

389
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,639
network between iit and ot

390
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,040
which you can bifurcate and decrease the

391
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,199
connectivity between the it and ot

392
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,560
which is there for the monitoring

393
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,360
purpose in fact blockchain is applicable

394
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,360
on the scada monitoring also

395
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,519
we can make a separate scada monitoring

396
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,600
solution which is based on blockchain

397
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,079
so that will bifurcate the connectivity

398
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,000
between the it and ot and it will create

399
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,279
a separate network

400
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,920
all together

401
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,480
so what is our proposed work as you can

402
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,399
see in the figure we have eradicated the

403
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,720
connectivity of it and ot environment

404
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,360
precisely level 3 to level 4 and 5 which

405
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,959
is a business network

406
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,720
moreover for monitoring purpose a

407
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,639
separate decentralized blockchain based

408
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,199
network is created and a secure access

409
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,680
is given to it and ot respectively

410
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,920
we have used hyperledger fabric in this

411
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,800
solution

412
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,480
though we can implement this on other

413
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,880
platforms like ethereum quorum

414
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,880
i will not say coda and ripple since it

415
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,160
is most suitable for fintech

416
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,519
applications

417
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,480
let's talk about the benefits now first

418
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,560
and foremost is again it is creating a

419
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,480
decentralized ot soft

420
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,560
second is access control accountability

421
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,000
and authorization

422
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,800
we are giving a secure access from both

423
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,920
it and ot

424
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,560
respectively third it is creating a

425
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,160
robust cyber threat intelligence

426
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,959
database

427
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,720
although you can make your own uh

428
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,639
blockchain based cyber threat uh

429
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,199
sharing platform as well uh if you use

430
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,800
uh if you are using the concept of

431
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,920
blockchain

432
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,680
again uh secure connectivity to

433
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,320
enterprise and business networks

434
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,880
robust network forensics since database

435
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,920
is immutable

436
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,079
uh in case in future some incident

437
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:52,959
happen

438
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,120
you are having a proper logs which is

439
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,959
immutable which can't be deleted and

440
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,720
tampered

441
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,880
when it comes to challenges we would say

442
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,560
all challenges associated with the

443
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,399
blockchain technology is applicable on

444
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,800
bb otms which is our proposed work

445
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,959
for instance scalability processing

446
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,560
security etc

447
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,800
but this concept and approach assumes

448
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,480
that we have implemented blockchain and

449
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,079
configuration of genesys blog in a

450
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,959
secure manner

451
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,519
why not hedge graph many of the

452
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,399
professionals

453
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,800
researchers peers must be thinking about

454
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,800
hashgraphs and why we are not using

455
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,360
hashgraph in ot security monitoring

456
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,360
it has a significant benefits over

457
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,720
blockchain like

458
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,600
it is faster than blockchain it is equal

459
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,560
level field

460
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,040
it is provable and verifiable it is

461
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,639
secure by byzantine

462
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,440
it is cheap and 100 efficient the answer

463
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,040
to that question is yes we can use

464
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,320
hashgraph as well

465
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,959
but it has some limitation like patented

466
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,639
technology

467
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,639
it is not easily available and the

468
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,800
majority of the problem arises when you

469
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,040
integrate hashgraph with the existing

470
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,160
solution

471
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,880
that you have so these are these are

472
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,639
some of the limitations due to which we

473
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,559
are not using hashgraph for this

474
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,280
but yes if you have a paid subscription

475
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,400
for the hashgraph

476
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,640
you can implement this concept using

477
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,280
hashgraph as well

478
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,679
all right thank you for attending this

479
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,439
session i hope you find it interesting

480
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,480
and useful

481
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,559
if you have any comments questions or

482
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,559
just want to discuss do not hesitate to

483
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,199
ask

484
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,760
thanks again
