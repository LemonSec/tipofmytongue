i really really appreciate right i've

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,480
introduced myself i'm a principal

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,600
security engineer at talk desk talk desk

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,920
is a company from portugal by the way

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,320
it's responsible to provide some contact

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,120
center as a services right from

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,559
they have many customers around the

19
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,120
world and i'm a security research at

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,120
senior segura san seguro it's a

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,360
brazilian company brazilian company but

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,079
they have many customers around the

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,559
world they have many products but the

24
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,039
the focus here is in um

25
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,799
in a privileged access management right

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,400
so in a fan

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,320
uh they have a big solutions that you

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,439
can implement in your trust uh zero

29
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,479
trust

30
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,880
environment or future that you can apply

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,640
this kind of concept it's pretty pretty

32
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,960
cool they appears in many different

33
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,880
reports like a gardener

34
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,960
foreign as well so it's pretty cool

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,119
right so i advocate this for some

36
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,960
projects hacking is not a crime they

37
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,360
know me it's pretty clear right because

38
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,439
hacking it's really not a crime it's a

39
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,960
mindset it's a creative mind it's how

40
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,880
you can apply your knowledgement when

41
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,479
you talk about the

42
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,000
security or

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
you know tech knowledge that's my point

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,040
here and um yes it's a pretty cool

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,040
project you can find many informations

46
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,040
in my social medias about there right

47
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,200
and i'm a part of the coordinate team on

48
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,200
the devcon groups here in sao paulo and

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,360
by the way i'm talking here from brazil

50
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,040
in sao paulo in my small walks in here

51
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,520
in my balcony by the way

52
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,159
it's a pandemic impact in this moment so

53

this is my small office and i'm

54
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,920
instructor of the hacker security it's a

55
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,800
brazilian company they sell some courses

56
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,200
uh about the penetration testing and in

57
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,200
many other different courts and i'm

58
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,280
instructor from the mar analysis course

59
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,680
in portuguese language right and i'm a

60
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,920

this free magazine fantastic magazine

62
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,400
hack 9 and a forensic magazine and by

63
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,080
the way i record a course of the malware

64
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,640
attack hunting based on cyber queue

65
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,879
chain here in ventes magazine you can

66
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,760
file there you can find there um

67
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,040
let me talk about our summary or agenda

68
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,040
right so today we're going to talk about

69
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,200
what is trap brainstorming what is

70
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,239
thready hunting about the python code

71
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,480
purples about this kind of tests that

72
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,879
i'm i made in my

73
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,120
environment right so i will explain

74
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,000
something about i will show you the demo

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and in the end of this presentation i'm

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,920
hoping to talk

77
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,560
about some questions right so first of

78
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,280
all

79
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,519
it's important to explain

80
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,440
some you know some concepts about what

81
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,040
is thread

82
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,400
uh it's very important because i would

83
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,239
like to put all those people with the

84
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,200
same page right so it's not my

85
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,680
definition it's according this iso right

86
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,879
so

87
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,080
27

88
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,920
0005 but it's defining as a potential

89
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,239
cause of the incident right so this is

90
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,799
the simple definition that may cause

91
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,879
hormones to system and organization it

92
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,040
means suffer attacks or maybe death

93
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,440
of intellectual property

94
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,000
or identity death right so not some

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,280
sabotage

96
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,319
or

97
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,280
you know all information distortion uh

98
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,760
are examples of the information security

99
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,519
threats it means

100
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:52,720
if you see

101
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,360
all those although all these things is

102
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,400
related to ascend software

103
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,040
maybe it's compiled or not right or some

104
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,159
apps

105
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,120
it's related a threat right so some

106
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,280
potential cost it's a simple definition

107
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,439
about the threat right so all these

108
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,560
results

109
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,280
uh

110
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,280
actually as a result most of these

111
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,680
organizations chose active

112
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,478
ready hunting practice it means

113
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,040
the organization need to see

114
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,520
more deeply about this kind of threat

115
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,199
it's known no

116
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,759
and you know to try improve the defenses

117
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,320
mechanism right so i would like to bring

118
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,639
you some brainstorm it's important to

119
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,639
build this kind of knowledgement right

120
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,479
so uh when you need to build some um

121
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,639
research chain we need to improve this

122
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,639
you need to create something

123
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,040
related to our working with the research

124
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,800
of these threats

125
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,720
we need to discovering new kind of

126
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,919
attacks

127
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,560
providing the team with the proactive

128
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,520
line it's very important it's some key

129
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,400
here we have a key proactive line

130
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,320
but it's you need to understand more

131
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,360
defenses against advanced threats

132
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,400
and it means uh apt is the later apts

133
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,759
what is apt

134
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,240
advanced persistent threat right another

135
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,880
point is you need to use this kind of

136
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,199
offensive techniques you need to

137
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,120
understand more about the vulnerability

138
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,720
research because

139
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,639
you know you need to

140
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,479
search some things about the

141
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,960
vulnerabilities related these threads

142
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,520
are related to this softwares

143
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,759
you need to develop it off exploit it's

144
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,520
very important because of course we need

145
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,560
to

146
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,960
in your team need to have this kind of

147
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,000
um

148
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,759
knowledgement about the

149
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,160
programming language right you need to

150
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,360
have

151
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,919
one guy or a lady with responsible to

152
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,720
make a reverse engineering or

153
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,880
to see more deeply to intrusion

154
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,240
detections

155
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,960
and we have

156
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,520
uh you you need to have actually inside

157
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,199
of your home some people

158
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,160
with uh with carved off knowledgement

159
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,479
related to a forensic analysis of course

160
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:03,919
when you talk about differences it's

161
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,440
after the incident you know but if you

162
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,120
have this kind of knowledge when you can

163
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,160
improve

164
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,720
your soft your development softwares

165
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,280
your skills development software your

166
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,720
defensive

167
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,720
uh mechanisms right

168
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,759
so the challenge here is uh to the

169
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,560
delivery automated intelligence

170
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,919
the company to gain productive right so

171
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,360
in the end of the day i think this is

172
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,360
the very important right

173
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,039
and

174
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,039
here i create this

175
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,639
kind of life

176
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,360
not life but this kind of cycle right so

177
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,479
because in the beginning we have a

178
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,360
thread after that you need to understand

179
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,440
about the known threads and about the

180
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,680
unknown tracks this is very important

181
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,120
why i need to know about the known

182
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,639
threads felipe

183
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,919
because it's very important to

184
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,000
understand about the behavior because

185
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,800
you improve your knowledgement and you

186
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,960
have this kind of acknowledgement of

187
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,720
course you can improve

188
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,479
you can have

189
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,880
this creative mind and i mentioned the

190
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,800
beginning of these conversations right

191
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,840
you can

192
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,599
after that

193
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,639
using your curiosity and and to try and

194
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,440
find

195
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,400
uh some unknown threats right and of

196
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,160
course after that you can improve you

197
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,479
can generate a report you can improve

198
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,039
your death defenses mechanism you can

199
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,840
create um you know a sabbath right

200
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,919
intelligence in your environment and you

201
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,319
can uh it's training the cyber

202
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,840
resiliency in your environment it's a

203
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,720
simple

204
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,479
life cycle that i create so what is

205
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,680
threading hunting it's a simple

206
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,919
definition again it's a proactive

207
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,720
approach to defense to the cyber defense

208
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,080
with

209
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,800
here is the key offensive mind it means

210
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
the process proactively and

211
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,759
interactively searching you know

212
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,520
through the network to the tech and

213
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,160
isolate it you have here we have two

214
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,160
keys detection and isolation right so to

215
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,680
detect and isolate advanced threats this

216
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,360
is the key because

217
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,440
i always uh mention in my talks

218
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,520
i can work with uh

219
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,720
you know

220
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,639
moral analysis uh or you know uh

221
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,879
sock team or in support teams

222
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,560
but i

223
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,639
i could have in my mind

224
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,520
this

225
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,879
kind of you know uh knowledge this is my

226
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,759
invite to you you know to bring

227
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,960
uh in your mind different uh thoughts

228
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,159
about

229
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,440
the thread right so more you know in the

230
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,320
top of tower that's my idea here so who

231
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,880
is strategy not who is or what he is or

232
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,679
maybe who is or

233
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,600
you know who is a threading hunter it's

234
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,399
a professional right qualified security

235
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,720
guy or you know professional to

236
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,120
recognize this the first and after that

237
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,760
two is already and after that to disable

238
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,600
a potential apt

239
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,760
in your environment using of course in

240
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,040
manually techniques or maybe um

241
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,720
artificial intelligence or another

242
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,519
different tools to see and to improve

243
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,160
right so these people or the people

244
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,360
actually these peoples uh can search for

245
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,560
a possible internal and or external

246
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,640
intruders here we have another

247
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,120
interesting key internals because

248
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,800
usually we have

249
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,519
in the past the people uh

250
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,080
look at look at so the external

251
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,640
intruders but now we have an internal

252
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,440
intruder that's a key important key here

253
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,490
right so

254
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,680
[Music]

255
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,279
okay felipe

256
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,240
first

257
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,680
you explain about that hunting about the

258
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,880
research

259
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,880
up you bring us

260
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,800
uh

261
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,640
some

262
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,800
thoughts about the

263
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,519
uh you know new vision not a new vision

264
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,680
actually so just my mind my

265
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,600
uh thoughts about that

266
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,399
and

267
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,000
about this actually and after that i

268
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,279
started to create some python scripts i

269
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,519
have of course some guys to work with

270
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,079
together with me to create together

271
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,760
these

272
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,760
tests and

273
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,560
the purple of does this test is

274
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,040
very simple the idea is this test

275
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,399
it was because i i already executed uh i

276
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,720
perform it actually um

277
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,480
to run pyron script to perform a various

278
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,880
efficient and detection tests

279
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,680
in various endpoint solutions that's my

280
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,720
idea do you remember mindset defensive

281
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,360
mindset not defensive mindset actually

282
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,760
defensive um

283
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,120
activities

284
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,480
with an offensive mindset that here is

285
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,240
the key right so during our

286
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,440
demonstrations we and not we but i i

287
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,680
will show a defensive security analysis

288
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,480
with that offensive mindset right as i

289
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,800
put in two pylons script responsible for

290
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,720
downloading some hours

291
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,320
in our environment in my lab environment

292
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,079
right so he i executed two

293
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,079
simple tests first test is the first

294
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,839
objective objective

295
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,200
um will be to simulate a target attacks

296
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,760
using a python script to obtain a

297
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,600
panoramic view of the resilience

298
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,120
presented its means the idea here here

299
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,320
is to

300
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,079
execute some downloads of in my

301
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,680
controller environment to detect what is

302
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,800
what or not what but how much is

303
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,079
efficient

304
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,720
the engine is responsible to signatures

305
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,959
in the endpoint securities and next

306
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,600
generation antivirus and machine

307
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,640
learning is

308
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,560
running these scripts the idea is to

309
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,519
download those artifacts directly in my

310
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,880
whitman machine and execute this kind of

311
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,399
tasks and my idea it was to see

312
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,839
the behavior of the signatures engines

313
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,720
and next generation antivirus engines

314
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
and machine learning right so this is

315
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,040
the first purpose the second purpose is

316
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,320
to run more than one python script with

317
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,200
the daily malwares because

318
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,839
of course by using this modern bazaar

319
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,240
repository

320
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,000
we have inside of this repository it's

321
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,399
very interesting repository with it's

322
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,639
available to open requests by api right

323
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,200
so if you try to execute this kind of

324
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,680
test you can download more than 2 000

325
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,519
real malwares in your environment per

326
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,680
day sometimes you have i don't know 1000

327
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,399
hours uh you know

328
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,800
update not updated but

329
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,240
um

330
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,519
you know um i can't uh uh i can upload

331
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,519
my mower inside of this repository so

332
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,279
you sometimes we have more than one

333
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,760
thousand hours per day inside of this

334
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,560
repository so you'd like to test you are

335
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,880
you would like to prove your security

336
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,800
point it's totally possible right so

337
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,519
here this is the first code python code

338
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,639
right so the first first of all as you

339
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,360
can see here in my code i just imported

340
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,320
this

341
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,240
the library right the requests and

342
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,279
systems and some arguments in the zone

343
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,560
and pi

344
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,560
zipper because the idea here is to

345
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,839
download

346
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,440
a malware and of course when you

347
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,920
download some hours from some repository

348
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,480
usually this mowers or this sample or

349
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,440
this file uh comes to the your

350
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,519
environment and uh z pad right so you

351
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,000
need to uncompress this file right so

352
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,560
this is the first idea here so

353
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,240
i'll be using the

354
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,279
the shot 2056

355
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,959
hash to download in my environment as

356
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,720
you can see here so this is a simple

357
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,480
program you know the dollar and more

358
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,240
simple from maura bazaar by abuse doc

359
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,320
x8 or ch this is the website right so

360
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,560
here's some parameters that i can set or

361
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,279
like

362
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,639
it's a similar flags in using a cli

363
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,600
right so first of all i need to

364
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,800
run the not run i need to uh

365
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,880
write the the hash

366
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,920
as you can see here and after that i can

367
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,000
unzip this file and download my uh mower

368
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,160
inside my environment right so it's very

369
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,720
very simple code too again i can set

370
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,839
the hash

371
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,279
i can set this flag right so the

372
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,320
then

373
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,680
that's s

374
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,040
and i need to

375
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,000
write the

376
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,320
i need to fill the the hash and after

377
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,560
that i need to set dash u

378
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,279
to unzip yeah to unzip the old fire of

379
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,760
course i need to set the password to

380
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,360
downloading my environments right right

381
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,279
so here this is the first step that i

382
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,839
can that i can show you you know using

383
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,560
the cyber reason solution first of all

384
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,720
it's very important to explain to the to

385
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,279
the to you and everyone

386
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,480
my idea here it's not to prove you what

387
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,680
is the best secured endpoint solution

388
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,800
right not my idea here the idea is to

389
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,079
bring you

390
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,000
this offense this security testing with

391
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,800
us

392
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,320
offensive mind right this is this the

393
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,920
purple of this

394
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,720
presentation and this idea right not

395
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,880
what is the best solutions take a look

396
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,440
it's very important to explain and to be

397
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,160
clear for everyone right so as you can

398
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,399
see here i set the python i did the

399
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,759
binary tool as it could the binary

400
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,360
script in my environment

401
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,680
and after that i called the script that

402
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,320
i

403
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,120
show you and i set dash s because i need

404
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,720
to set the hash responsible to download

405
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,320
this information

406
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,880
and after that i set this

407
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,759
u

408
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,680
because the sample needs to be unzipped

409
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,000
right in my environment as you can see

410
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,360
here this is

411
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,920
uh let me return here

412
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,839
and

413
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,480
yes i need to use the request of course

414
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,079
to request

415
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,839
the access in my uh environment right in

416
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,959
my uh in our bazaar website right so

417
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,839
just to be clear and here the first test

418
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,040
in uh

419
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,160
using the cyber reason platform right so

420
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,560
i download this hash

421
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,639
as you can see here in the beginning of

422
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,639
the hash of course it's very bigger but

423
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,880
it's that e and d

424
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,720
as you can see here in our bazaar it's i

425
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,120
wanna cry it's very known hour

426
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,360
and summer by the way and i download

427
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,360
this mower in my environment as you can

428
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,480
see here and i execute this uh

429
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,199
uncompressed file here and after that

430
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,959
take a look what happened

431
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,680
the file is a block it's very

432
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,920
interesting because i don't need to

433
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,240
execute themselves in my environment

434
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,040
just to unzip the file inside my in my

435
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,120
environment and after that the engine do

436
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,040
you remember the test the engine

437
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,959
responsible to to signatures detect that

438
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,160
this mower right so as you can see in

439
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,280
the log

440
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,400
the mower

441
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,039
it was blocked in the tech it's very

442
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,679
cool and the second let me check here

443
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,000
yes this is the second test that i did

444
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,480
but in the sofa solutions it's another

445
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,119
security and point solutions the same

446
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,799
thing here i just

447
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,959
changed the mower right by using another

448
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,199
hash as you can see here by the way i

449
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,559
like to use

450
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,120
menu ram servers because it's it's very

451
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,480
dangerous right

452
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,960
and uh here it's another i think it's a

453
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,120
patch or no patch if i remember

454
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,440
correctly but you know

455
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,600
i download here as you can see and after

456
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,280
that take a look at this the engine

457
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,280
responsible to detect

458
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,480
the

459
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,679
gnome hour

460
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,559
it works very cool very well and it was

461
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,799
blocked right so

462
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,320
let's see here another the second code

463
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,720
iron code using a different in a

464
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,440
different way here

465
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,280
as you can see here it's different

466
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,200
because if you remember in the beginning

467
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,360
the explanation when i talked to you

468
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,360
about the second code or the second

469
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,480
objective the idea is to download

470
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,320
a daily breath black branch mowers right

471
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,360
it means

472
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,480
every day the marbles i receive many

473
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,480
mowers from the community

474
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,799
and in the end of the days uh the

475
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,919
marbles are generate uh mower branch uh

476
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,280
sam mowers and you can download all

477
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,240
those mowers inside your environment to

478
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,760
test themselves right so here you can uh

479
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,400
write your api provide power bazaar and

480
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,520
of course

481
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,760
in here you you using the request

482
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,120
python code

483
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,160
and you can unzip

484
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,320
your file uh your

485
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,360
actually it's not a second it's a uh the

486
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,760
continue sorry it's a continue of this

487
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,960
code as you can see here to any uh for a

488
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,520
line and after that let me show you is

489
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,799
24 6 because i i edit this code just to

490
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,840
show this is the request using the the

491
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,559
import request library right so this is

492
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:13,679
the

493
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,360
the api uh url to using in our test

494
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,960
right so

495
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,440
and uh here i execute in my environment

496
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,559
but using or to try explain explore more

497
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,600
um

498
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,480
about the cloud strike testing right so

499
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,160
here as you can see

500
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,360
um i using execute the same test but in

501
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,679
this case is something

502
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,480
different happens

503
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,080
as you can see

504
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,799
i

505
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,760
i edit my actually my code and using

506
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,760
another name here in the zoo security

507
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,320
labs and i download the sample here the

508
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,600
hashing and i uh um using the

509
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,000
downloading and i am package of its main

510
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,400
site and compress this file here as you

511
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,480
can see but counter strike works a

512
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,000
different way

513
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,919
because crowdstrike just works with uh

514
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,280
um a real-time execution it means i need

515
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,880
to execute the mower inside my

516
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,200
environment and after that

517
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,320
they

518
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,520
will execute their uh engines in your

519
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,159
environment they don't have any uh

520
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,640
in that maybe on that time they didn't

521
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,600
have

522
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,159
the such signatures engines right so

523
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,880
maybe now when i'm talking in this

524
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,120
presentation maybe they are improved

525
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,840
this button when i did this test and as

526
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,200
you can see here in october 2020

527
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,799
they didn't right so that's here very

528
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,960
important so here the second codes are

529
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,919
for that

530
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,280
so here

531
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,760
as you can see here from daytime import

532
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,240
data and time delta right this is the

533
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,799
just import some uh functions from this

534
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,159
library right and here i i import

535
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,400
another libraries

536
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,720
from this uh

537
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,159
this as another things

538
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,280
and uh

539
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,039
let's see here are using the same

540
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,280
subsequent labs the supremes

541
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,360
you know that to be

542
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,400
cool

543
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,919
and using the the password to

544
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,039
unzip the file right and here the key

545
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,240
right so

546
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,360
i can set the data to download it means

547
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,240
i can

548
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,520
set the specifically date you can set

549
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,760
here the specifically day

550
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,760
that i would like to download in my

551
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,280
environment for example if you would

552
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,400
like to

553
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,240
uh try download

554
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,799
another day that already passed for

555
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,679
example uh for you know

556
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,159
my day and not at the the main day i can

557
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,640
write here your right that the the

558
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,679
correctly start uh time as you can see

559
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,000
here right but if i don't set this

560
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,280
information

561
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,840
that they responsible to be downloaded

562
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,360
in the last day that i received many uh

563
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,840
you know daily malware batches right as

564
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,760
you can see here so

565
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,960
again

566
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,320
uh i can using data here by the way it's

567
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,559
in the not um

568
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,480
the python script it's in python 3

569
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,400
actually but we have another

570
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,120
different uh strings that i can

571
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,919
that i used here and i will download

572
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,400
using the api as you can see here

573
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,880
take a look this here is the day

574
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,360
specifically day right and i said the

575
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,679
name of the power from our batches

576
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,919
and i will

577
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,120
request using the mower bazaar

578
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,480
dash

579
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,880
download as you can see here and

580
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,559
here is the date

581
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,520
the date file right so as you compare if

582
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,600
you compare this both of them it's

583
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,760
different because here i

584
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,360
request the api right uh that should be

585
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,400
one but i set the hash to remember let

586
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,360
me return here i need to set the

587
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,760
corrective hash right so this is the

588
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,360
important thing here

589
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,960
so checksum

590
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,400
the rash right so i need to um

591
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,679
feel the rash and here in the second i

592
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,919
using the diff in different ways i need

593
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,000
to set the date or if i don't set the

594
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,960
date it's a full day right so here i

595
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,120
will um

596
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,440
download the zip in my environment i

597
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,039
will complete download it and i will uh

598
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,720
you know uncompress

599
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,679
and as you can see here daily mower bags

600
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,039
um package it means all those bowers

601
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,480
it will be

602
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,320
what will be

603
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,960
in my environment right so here it's

604
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,360
very important thing to explain

605
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,720
so let's suppose we have uh we remember

606
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,960
more than 200

607
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,039
mowers in your environment

608
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,240
it's like outbreak attack right so

609
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,240
you can imagine if you receive something

610
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,440
like a similar dos from the mowers it's

611
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,480
you know just uh let's suppose again

612
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,520
okay so i as i put this in this cyber

613
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,880
reasoning environment as you can see

614
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,240
here so uh this is this contesting using

615
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,520
a

616
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,320
a python script here and a name it's a

617
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,320
malware

618
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,000
hour in the score sorry uh

619
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,799
download.python right so download using

620
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,679
the data as you can see here it's uh

621
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,279
september 10th

622
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,000
download using this as you can see here

623
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,840
that the folder is different right it's

624
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,640
not

625
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,520
api versus one right or v1 it's

626
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,120
different it's a

627
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,080
mb

628
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,480
the the api dot abuse dot h oops sorry

629
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,640
and uh

630
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,679
downloads and here is the date and after

631
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,559
that the download is completed

632
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,279
and saving that that data sets

633
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,240
completely and data sets because we have

634
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,279
a mini

635
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,760
all the mowers here's unpacked as you

636
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,400
can see here in this folder and take a

637
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,200
look at this what is the behavior and of

638
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,200
course because you if you receive some

639
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,000
multi-break attack of course you have a

640
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,400
high cpu high memory

641
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,760
in your environment because you have

642
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,080
many samples here's

643
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,400
new you know

644
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,120
informations in your hard drive and of

645
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,080
course the engine needs to work so

646
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,120
i have good results here's not so good

647
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,840
but just a good because

648
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,200
the the server isn't working with um

649
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,080
but it's in my tasks some reason it was

650
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,360
the best

651
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,440
right and after that as you can see here

652
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,400
i usually put the same testing power uh

653
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,159
bazaar uh

654
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,440
underscore

655
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,720
um

656
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,720
daily and as you can see here it's

657
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,480
another day because here is 28 september

658
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,480
it's different this day as you can see

659
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,480
18 days afters

660
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,240
and take a look at this

661
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,039
the performer or the performance of this

662
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,440
the cpu it was different because we have

663
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,880
many engines

664
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,960
as you can see here's for my opinion

665
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,840
it's a sleepy period's opinion

666
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,760
it's more difficult because we haven't

667
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,919
many engines works as you can see here

668
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,440
in this parade

669
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,720
and uh

670
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,039
in the results it's not so good in this

671
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,760
in that time right and uh of course all

672
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,080
those tests guys i reported to the all

673
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,480
those vendors and i kind of strike and

674
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,600
the soulfuls and in some reason i have

675
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,400
very good talks with the cyber reason i

676
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,720
talk with a cso from cyber reasons and

677
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,279
the team from somewhere it's very very

678
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,159
cool i talk i have some talks with us a

679
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,960
surface and crowdstrike not so good but

680
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,679
anyway it's a simple test and my idea is

681
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,400
to try and prove the security sensors

682
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,960
right so here

683
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,120
some exploited other then i will finish

684
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,520
my presentations because here i'm using

685
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,200
another python code it's a 30 30

686
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,120
python code as you can see here i import

687
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,159
the os socket and sub process and

688
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,440
threading so maybe if you are

689
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,720
offensive guy

690
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,760
you can

691
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,480
suppose what this means in this case so

692
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,200
as you can see here i set the socket

693
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,679
using a

694
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:26,080
af8 it's means my idea here is to try

695
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,600
gain the access in my victim machine as

696
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
you can see here

697
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,520
so

698
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,320
as you can see here i set this kind of

699
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,399
process in windows

700
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,399
system 32

701
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:44,720
to call the cmd right it's a spoiler why

702
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,840
is i spoiler felipe because i haven't

703
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,120
talked

704
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,760
to explain all those attacks it's just a

705
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,120
spoiler right so here this uh test that

706
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,200
i did i just show you off some

707
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,919
informations to you this test is to us

708
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,919
realizing a counter strike as you can

709
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,320
see here so i will pass

710
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,799
the idea here this is the

711
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,600
ip from this machine

712
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,679
the solution worked here in this case

713
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,080
it's called the strike as you can see

714
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,320
the system information the season from

715
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,520
system information about this solution

716
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,960
and let me pass more here you can see

717
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,760
the all those informations that you have

718
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,720
here

719
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,279
you have some powershell scriptes and

720
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,159
python shell.python here

721
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,720
as you can see this is the

722
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,760
file

723
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,279
that i will using in my

724
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,640
next presentation this is just a

725
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,679
fail

726
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,039
fill a spoiler alert right so i set the

727
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,760
configurations here i will pass more all

728
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,480
those configurations uh about the

729
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,880
best practices it was

730
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,399
um enable

731
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,440
in aggressive mode by the way so

732
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,919
should be detect my

733
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,880
simple simple python

734
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:12,240
spell reverse code right and let me

735
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,880
show you here as you can see

736
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,960
all those

737
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,279
process and uh

738
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,880
it was enabled in my viktor machine

739
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,320
and after that take a look where i did

740
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,679
in my demonstrations here and i

741
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:30,720
just

742
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,880
opened my

743
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,840
you know using a netcat here using that

744
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,000
port 77

745
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,039
right and i oh this is my attacking

746
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,080
machine

747
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,320
and i will execute a simple attack here

748
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,240
how you call

749
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,840
this spiden

750
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,880
shell

751
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,559
and what

752
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,159
happened in my victim machine here

753
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,640
maybe nothing happened here's because we

754
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,000
didn't

755
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
see any blockade but

756
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,600
wow

757
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,320
we have a

758
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,960
shell in my victim machine as you can

759
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,399
see here

760
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,440
this is a good spoiler alert because we

761
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,520
have another talk

762
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,640
explain more details about that take a

763
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,840
look at this

764
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,880
we have

765
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,159
the control of the our victim machine

766
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,000
and let's see here how you

767
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,240
have you went to the

768
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,799
desktop and after that i

769
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,159
created this

770
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,520
simple simple file right so

771
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,880
echo

772
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,000
you lose very very creative as you can

773
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,279
see here

774
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:44,640
right so

775
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,000
because

776
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,640
the victim machine lose or lose okay so

777
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,000
type the

778
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,200
file that i'm creating here

779
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
because i'm manipulating because i have

780
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,399
a shell here

781
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,760
i have a shell

782
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,919
i have a control of my vikman machine

783
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,960
here it's here because

784
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,320
before

785
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,080
didn't have here

786
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,519
and as you can see here the file it's

787
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,480
here

788
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,159
and after that

789
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:14,960
oh

790
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,200
after that finish my presentation

791
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,960
because it's just our only affiliate

792
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,440
spoiler right so

793
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,519
guys and uh again thank you so much for
