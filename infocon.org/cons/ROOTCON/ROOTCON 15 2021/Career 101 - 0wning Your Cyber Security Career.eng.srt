and uh

24
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,160
i'm a hacker

25
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,879

years now

27
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,120
i guess that's a quick uh

28
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,840
history i started more of a tech support

29
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,039
guy

30
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,160
and i moved into

31
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,119
being a security administrator no a

32
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,439
systems administrator where i met of

33
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,799
course dax was the founder and

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,360
some of the awesome goons and uh

35
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,439
i got of course inspired to join cyber

36
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,040
security and uh you know what that that

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,720
my friends would be

38
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,280
one of the best decisions if not the

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,439
best decision that i made in my entire

40
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,479
career

41
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,799
trust me and uh

42
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,360
so yeah um after that i did have a

43
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,560
chance to

44
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,840
move into security administration

45
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,040

on to was my presentation so

99
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,360
just so everyone knows there's actually

100
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,920
a great problem right now in cyber

101
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,040
security

102
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,879
and uh

103
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,959
they kind of sometimes would

104
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,519
call it the cyber security talent crunch

105
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,920
um so right now there's a big problem in

106
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,159
global insecurity we're in there's a lot

107
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,200
of need for for for people in security

108
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,560
and uh but there's just not a lot of

109
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,159
talent there's no there's not a lot of

110
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,239
supply and because of this a lot of

111
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,840
companies are struggling

112
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,519
uh to be able to protect their their

113
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,040
company because there's just not a lot

114
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,120
of people to help them with

115
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,879
so um

116
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,478
just to

117
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,798
of course show some statistics

118
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,320
so

119
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,960
as per assembly ventures it is

120
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,120
it's been uh expected

121
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,320
that uh

122
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,240
by 2021

123
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,160
there will be about more than three

124
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,919
million uh in cyber security job

125
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,120
openings

126
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,800
throughout the world and uh

127
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,960
four hundred thousand of which will be

128
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,120
coming from europe but you know us being

129
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,560
in apac

130
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,120
will be they're expecting more than two

131
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,680
million job openings actually

132
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,199
and um

133
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,280
you know

134
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,360
they say that you know there's been a

135
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,160
rise of 250 percent in terms of unfilled

136
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,320
jobs and securities which is just a lot

137
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,440
of you know uh uh what i call the search

138
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,560
right now for

139
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,080
for people in security but there's just

140
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,520
not a lot of people

141
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,440
and uh

142
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,520
they say that in the us alone there's

143
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,080
about 300 000 field jobs

144
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,039
and

145
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,880
if you check actually if they say if you

146
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,600
check

147
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,720
the

148
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,880
the the opening job openings they would

149
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,360
say that about 4 45 exactly cyber

150
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,560
security

151
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,880
and uh

152
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,560
of course uh

153
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,039
if you do a quick check on the

154
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,880
on some of our platforms right now link

155
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,639
in for example

156
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,960
uh this is actually the i did it just a

157
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,360
couple of days ago just to test and you

158
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,600
see there's about six thousand

159
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,919
um jobs already i did a quick check on

160
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,120
job street they say that we have 2 700

161
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,800
jobs for you

162
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,320
you know

163
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,639
that's just the demand right now which

164
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,680
is uh

165
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,280
just good in a way for us but of course

166
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,560
there's those shows that there's

167
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,960
certainly a problem and a need to grow

168
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,560
more uh people in cyber security

169
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,880
and to add to that of course because of

170
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,680
the

171
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,880
of the of the

172
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,479
of the demand and not enough supply

173
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,560
of course they say that the value rises

174
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,919
right so let's talk about a bit about

175
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:12,720
the

176
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,720
the

177
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,400
salaries right now or

178
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,039
compensation so they say that security

179
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,720
is currently

180
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,000
number four

181
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,199
best uh technology job right now um

182
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,919
number 15 and uh of course in one of the

183
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,880
best jobs and number four in technology

184
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,080
uh this is a quick i did a quick check

185
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,800
um on uh sorry explorer

186
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,400
this for an analyst which is more of

187
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,720
like an entry position

188
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,639
so they say that the average is about

189
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,919
50k

190
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:44,960
uh

191
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,199
did a quick check on on on

192
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,479
indeed

193
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,800
these are the figures right there but of

194
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,400
course if you're really good to be

195
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,160
honest like i said there's there's a big

196
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,440
demand if you're really good you could

197
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,479
actually

198
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,360
you know see a couple of this this here

199
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,319
and there you know uh this is actually

200
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,319
what what is actually in store for you

201
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,240
you know if you if you do

202
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,400
well in the industry um

203
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,560
so yeah there's a lot of the job is

204
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,240
really good there's a lot of demand but

205
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,560
you know just wondering you know why is

206
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,319
it still so hard to land a job in cyber

207
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,360
security

208
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,759
and uh why is it that you know some of

209
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,800
us

210
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,680
uh

211
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,720
feel that we're not just getting as much

212
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,479
uh in in our role right now um

213
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,479
yeah this has been the the questions

214
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,000
being asked now i've been

215
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,800
i've been uh interviewing a lot of of

216
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,880
of candidates for the past

217
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,199
for the past weeks and i just noticed

218
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,240
that

219
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,680
a lot of people are

220
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,080
are um you know there's a lot of

221
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,919
companies looking for a job but some of

222
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,160
the guys are just able to land one

223
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,240
so that is one of one of the things that

224
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,560
we will try to address uh for this

225
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,599
presentation so

226
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,319
so yeah i am uh like i said i'm a gamer

227
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,000
so i'm gonna you know

228
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,680
try to run through this like how you

229
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,919
would a game right let's let's think of

230
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,759
cyber security as

231
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,720
an adventure game and we'll be starting

232
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,240
asking

233
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,960
a

234
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,639
character if you want to join cyber

235
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,160
security so

236
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,120
yeah let's

237
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,199
go ahead and play so of course um

238
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,960
first thing you need to do uh when

239
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,319
you're starting out

240
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,639
is you know for you as a as a new guy to

241
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,720
choose a role but there's a lot of roles

242
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,559
right now that's that's more entert

243
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,200
entry level um you could start off as

244
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,240
being a

245
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,958
security researcher you could

246
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,679
uh be a secret administrator

247
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,839
uh junior fan tester

248
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,160
if you're into more of being an analyst

249
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,240
an investigator it's also a good option

250
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,680
or you're more into security audit

251
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,279
could be a security technician

252
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,000
programmer so programmers that can

253
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,959
help develop like scripts or or tools

254
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,760
for for security there's a lot of these

255
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,959
choices right and you know when you're

256
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,360
starting out it feels like you know you

257
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,399
think uh where should it start right

258
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,240
it's always a question but i think

259
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,320
my my tip there would be you know don't

260
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,160
overthink this

261
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,839
just go ahead and start you know yeah

262
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:16,800
you

263
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,080
uh

264
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,640
like to say there is no one best path to

265
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,800
success in cyber security a lot of the

266
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,320
guys that we know who are successful

267
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,519
right now

268
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,519
a lot of people start in you know

269
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,440
different starting points some of us

270
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,240
started as myself i started in

271
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,720
being a tech support guy doing

272
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,800
more of a network administration other

273
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,200
guys started as more of a

274
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,800
uh

275
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,040
a web app developer you know the heck i

276
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,120
even had someone who used to be a

277
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,720
dentist

278
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,000
and move into cyber security and so yeah

279
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,760
don't worry about it just just just

280
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,680
choose one and start um

281
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,440
except we all have to start somewhere

282
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,760
and uh but of course you have to choose

283
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,279
something that you currently like or in

284
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,680
time of course you have to

285
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,600
do a bit of research on that which one

286
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,279
are you more inclined to are you more of

287
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,600
an offensive guy do you like more of

288
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,800
defending

289
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,959
or are you more into doing research you

290
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,600
know but once you you have

291
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,720
something that you feel that you want to

292
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,000
pursue just

293
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,640
go for it don't don't don't uh

294
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,959
go into like more of an uh

295
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,560
i call this

296
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,079
uh

297
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,920
no not the game will to start because

298
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,440
you're just not sure

299
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,839
um

300
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,760
and yeah lastly you can always do a job

301
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,440
change later on the good thing about

302
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,519
spirit is it's a very large domain uh

303
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,440
you can always start somewhere and later

304
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,040
on you realize that

305
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,800
uh you actually

306
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,399
want to be on the

307
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,680
on the uh

308
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,440
the other side you know so or you want

309
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,680
to a certain time a certain point you

310
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,959
are doing well

311
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,440
at this point but no later on

312
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,560
you would want to move to a

313
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,560
different role later on so that's also a

314
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,480
possibility so again don't worry too

315
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,640
much about it once you you've chosen

316
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,560
more of a path that you want just just

317
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,680
uh go for it

318
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,399
so uh

319
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,040
first i just would like to quote uh

320
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,560
one of the guys that i

321
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,480
definitely respect in the industry

322
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,399
um he said that you know entry-level

323
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,399
positions don't really exist in cyber

324
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,720
security um

325
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,800
in order to be useful to a team you have

326
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,200
to be useful in the first day

327
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,680
so this that's a that's a very important

328
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,720
quote you know

329
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,040
uh so in cyber security you have to make

330
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,480
sure that you have

331
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,519
what it takes to do don't don't come uh

332
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,360
don't come to a team just you know uh

333
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,440
not knowing anything and just

334
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,480
waiting for or hoping that someone will

335
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,720
just teach you everything right

336
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,920
so uh

337
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,519
start with that

338
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,200
and uh of course once you have uh

339
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,440
nowhere to start next question would be

340
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,360
you know as you progress

341
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,120
uh what is it that you need so you've

342
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,480
already decided

343
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,440
uh you've already decided to choose a

344
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,279
path now the question is what do you

345
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,040
need in order for you to

346
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,240
to succeed

347
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,000
in the troll that you have in order to

348
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,440
progress right

349
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,000
um

350
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,959
so there are actually three things

351
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,200
that uh i

352
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,600
i feel that it's very important when

353
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,200
you're starting out

354
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,680
in security and uh

355
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,120
first is uh education so

356
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,440
uh and you have experience and you have

357
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,440
certifications there are three things so

358
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,680
it's like a game i kind of think about

359
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,440
that you know so your weapons and your

360
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,040
shields and you know

361
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,079
your patches in a way so

362
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,920
education is

363
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,160
what you know

364
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,959
experience is what you can do and um

365
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,399
certification is what you are capable of

366
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,240
all right so uh i'll be talking a bit

367
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,320
about a lot more about this theorem but

368
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,079
yeah uh these are the three things that

369
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,240
will be very crucial for you you know

370
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,240
that you that you will need in order for

371
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,000
you to or that you need to develop in

372
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,600
order for you to to progress

373
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,000
um

374
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,480
so

375
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,800
he said uh this is more like we are

376
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
still on the early game you know

377
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,279
uh so first is education a couple of

378
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,240
tips so um education is it's not really

379
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,000
something really you know really big

380
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,360
it's just about

381
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,959
what what i mean by education when

382
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,399
you're starting out is you know make

383
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,399
sure that you have of course a diploma

384
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,800
or a bachelor's course a bachelor's

385
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,760
degree

386
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,959
would be you know

387
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,480
computer science i think engineering

388
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,519
matter

389
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,440
you know if you started more of doing

390
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,199
technical courses you're you're more

391
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,600
into you started with two-year course

392
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,120
doing um

393
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,279
you know a computer technician or

394
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,839
something like that or

395
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,760
also be you you

396
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,959
you studied on the different platforms

397
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,120
undergone different trainings like uh

398
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,040
once you try hack me hack the box sports

399
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,079
vigor

400
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,639
udemy sudbury

401
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,519
and uh but yeah those these are really

402
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,000
important for you to start um you need

403
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,880
to

404
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,680
to uh to make sure that you you you kind

405
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,600
of have this

406
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,639
well as you see both of the early stages

407
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,600
uh in security um second is experience

408
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,560
no good experience is a bit uh what you

409
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,839
call this

410
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,920
the irony of it is that you know they

411
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,160
say that when you need experience for

412
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,040
you to

413
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,240
to get the job but you also need a job

414
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,000
to get experience you know but that's

415
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,720
the

416
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,120
that's the that's always been the

417
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,800
the debate but you know what

418
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,720
you can actually gain experience even

419
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,639
without a child i think that's that's

420
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,160
one of the things that you need to think

421
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,639
about no so um

422
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,120
you could gain experience by setting up

423
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,199
your own lab for example

424
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,199
on your laptops out of a virtual machine

425
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,839
spin up some test laps in practice um

426
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,760
you could join a lot of you know

427
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,440
the flag

428
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,000
events or even platforms uh you could

429
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,480
start by practicing your skills on bug

430
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,959
bounty platforms uh

431
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,760
and of course do some some freelancing

432
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,600
internship volunteer works a lot of

433
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,360
things you could actually gain

434
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,519
experience from

435
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,440
and

436
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,399
it's also to like also to quote that

437
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,720
sometimes like i said in security

438
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,519
there's

439
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,040
a lot of times some of the guys really

440
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,920
started from from different fields like

441
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,320
we have people that experience more

442
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,880
coming from id support coming from web

443
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,800
development coming from network

444
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,279
networking this some of the guys some of

445
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,279
the the people we call this more of

446
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,000
father father experience uh meaning

447
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,440
these are some of the the basic

448
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,680
experiences that you could just feed

449
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,480
into uh into your profile of where to

450
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,600
join uh transition into uh joining a

451
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,160
cyber security career

452
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,279
so

453
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,680
yeah again uh you

454
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,920
don't don't don't think about you know i

455
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,680
don't have experience just make sure

456
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,079
that you you you get yourself trained in

457
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:02,880
other

458
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,199
in other things that you could uh

459
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,279
to practice on to gain some some

460
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,560
hands-on experience in a way before uh

461
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,079
coming to us and

462
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,440
trying to pursue a certain security job

463
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,880
um

464
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,279
third is as i mentioned certification so

465
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,519
certification is more of

466
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,399
for me

467
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,079
are your achievements or your proof of

468
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,160
your capabilities you know

469
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,120
um

470
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,759
there's been a lot of talking

471
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,160
should i get certification it's just

472
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,240
just a paper certification it's just you

473
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,040
know at the end of the day um i'll be

474
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,720
honest with you um coming from from from

475
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,759
from uh

476
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,279
a position of the one hiring people if

477
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,480
you are

478
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,040
there's a lot of of cvs in front of you

479
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,120
who would you choose first of course

480
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,279
you kind of have that that inclination

481
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,320
to

482
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,199
to

483
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,880
you know uh

484
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,800
uh give some advantage to the the one

485
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,079
with the certificate with the

486
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,240
certification why because

487
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,880
this certification especially the

488
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,880
the what they call the major ones where

489
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,400
they have already shows that this guy

490
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,559
has potential so

491
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,799
certifications you know some people

492
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,480
think that it's it's not important or

493
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,280
they

494
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,119
they're not that they feel like that's

495
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,039
it's it's not really good but you know

496
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,199
what it really gets you to win for me

497
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,319
so

498
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,160
so if you have a chance if you have the

499
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,079
capability

500
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,599
go for it i will advise you to go for it

501
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,200
especially if you're starting out

502
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,960
and um

503
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,520
don't have much on your resume if you're

504
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,880
a fresh graduate for example you know uh

505
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,640
you you don't have much in your resume

506
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,760
so you have to

507
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,280
put something in there to show that you

508
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,360
are actually interested right so

509
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,960
certification is one

510
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,039
some tips on certification as mentioned

511

these are the common ones that i do see

520
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,320
probably because it's more affordable

521
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,160
especially from us you know we're not

522

um a lot of people say that you know

538
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,559
insecurity

539
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,480
uh

540
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,080
it's not really about you know that

541
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,240
degree you could always be a hacker

542
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,240
without having a degree right and

543
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,679
you know i i don't i don't i can't

544
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,760
really argue with that but trust me when

545
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,840
i say that you know a degree will really

546
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,919
help you in the long run when you're

547
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,280
gunning for that

548
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,440
for that higher position

549
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,799
you're going for that more management

550
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,080
you know

551
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,880
that of the day uh then

552
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,360
especially in the in the

553
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,720
in the in the local scene in the

554
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,200
philippines he's not gonna look for it

555
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,120
and i know it's it's unfortunate you

556
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,880
know some people even say that you know

557
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,440
it's unfair but that of the day it is

558
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,240
what it is right and we're just trying

559
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,320
to hack our way into the system and

560
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,280
trust me

561
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,600
even if you take it later on if you

562
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,200
could get the degree

563
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,720
go for it it will really help you along

564
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,799
yeah in the long run

565
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,120
um

566
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,360
second develop strong fundamentals you

567
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,039
know by what i mean by this is when

568
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,120
you're developing a small

569
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,559
strong fundamentals you mean that you

570
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,400
must know how things work

571
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,160
and why it works

572
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,160
um a lot of times i've been interviewed

573
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,240
interviewing a couple of guys you know

574
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,559
they actually i interviewed them even an

575
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,440
oscp for example in ocp it was really

576
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,679
good with you know tools doing ctfs but

577
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,080
when i when i asked him

578
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,799
what was you know how this error cap

579
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,200
work or how does responder work for

580
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,720
example

581
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,240
he doesn't even understand what what

582
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,240
what's behind it right so you need to

583
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,919
understand your fundamentals that's very

584
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,520
important

585
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,960
um

586
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,760
so

587
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,200
just to put it out there there's been a

588
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,799
lot of talk this morning over here just

589
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,400
to put it there these are the the

590
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,320
important ones that you need to

591
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,440
focus on in terms of fundamentals

592
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,000
networking you know your layers force

593
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,280
protocols

594
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,679
uh try to learn if you can you know

595
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,039
learn to code

596
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,760
python patch powershell um python is

597
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,760
usually the one that's being advised

598
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,000
because it's it's the platforms a lot of

599
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,240
automation that you can do with it

600
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,240
and then learn an operating system

601
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,840
enochs is also most advised because you

602
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,840
could you know uh opens for it's open

603
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,520
source you can do a lot with it you know

604
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,600
try to understand the structure

605
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,080
uh to understand permissions

606
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,400
how processes works you know

607
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,159
the commands in it these are the

608
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,760
fundamentals that you need to develop

609
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,360
coming in

610
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,919
um just because you have

611
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,799
uh and in all honesty uh it's it's sad

612
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,000
but you know

613
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,480
uh in in our country even if you

614
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,039
graduate at i.t if you graduated from

615
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,880
computer science

616
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,520
this are not really you know uh

617
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,600
i've had a lot of graduates when i asked

618
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,840
them what a subject mask is i have them

619
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,120
with our audience they can they don't

620
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,960
even know it you know

621
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,760
so when you move into security this is

622
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,600
really important you have to have these

623
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,760
fundamentals

624
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,880
and

625
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,760
um

626
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,000
we can't teach you how to

627
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,840
hack or how to penetrate how to do

628
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,679
investigations if you don't have this

629
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,840
fundamentals and to be honest if i were

630
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,039
the company

631
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:47,840
you know

632
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,000
why would i hire you and you know pay

633
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,760
you so i could train you and teach you

634
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,440
these fundamentals right

635
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,360
you have to prove yourself and study

636
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,158
this before coming to

637
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,320
um

638
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,960
still on education a bit of advice like

639
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,960
i said these are more advices for for

640
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,039
your career focus on learning one thing

641
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,240
at a time

642
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,480
um

643
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,480
there everyone has has their own style

644
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,720
of studying but um i've seen a couple of

645
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,559
you know great pen testers or great

646
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,880
security persons or you know great um

647
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,320
investigators what do you do is they

648
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,520
spend just

649
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,679
a certain amount of time posting one

650
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,200
thing like maybe for this week i want to

651
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,280
focus on exercise the next week i want

652
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,520
to focus sql injection i want to focus

653
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,679
on network you know

654
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,520
uh i want to focus doing

655
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,480
python for two months i want to do web

656
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,720
vpt for a year or you know

657
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,600
next year and do uh instant response for

658
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,799
a year

659
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,440
just focus on one thing at the time um

660
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,360
with security

661
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,960
there's a temptation where you you want

662
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,960
to know everything but you know

663
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,520
uh believe me that you know you have to

664
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,120
you have to start with one thing at a

665
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,280
time and don't worry since you're we're

666
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,720
talking about the early game here you're

667
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,000
probably still young

668
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,799
um so there's still a lot of time for

669
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,280
you to catch up but you know just just

670
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,440
learn and feel really good one thing at

671
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,280
a time and you'll get there um

672
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,320
so it's it's it's a bit uh funny but

673
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,559
yeah i i would also advise you know game

674
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,240
to know a little bit of about everything

675
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,000
security we need to know a little bit

676
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,440
about everything

677
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,360
but uh you have to specialize in one

678
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,280
especially if you're starting out

679
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,480
uh

680
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,960
you know even i when i i

681
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,880
interview someone

682
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,799
when a company interviews someone

683
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,840
they're actually looking for a certain

684
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,000
skill if i'm looking for an incident you

685
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,039
know

686
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,240
a

687
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,360
handler or a sock analyst if i'm looking

688
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,320
for a pen tester who are looking for the

689
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,039
skills that's related to that

690
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,279
if you are like you know from from one

691
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,520
to five you are uh you're a flat three

692
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,360
on everything

693
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,200
and you apply for for something it's

694
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,360
very specialized it would be

695
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,919
uh disadvantageous for you in a way for

696
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,600
example if you were playing a game right

697
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,360
you're playing a knight for example i

698
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,880
remember when i was starting out playing

699
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,799
ragnarok um

700
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,120
i thought that it's the best way to do

701
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,400
it is to

702
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,000
just you know balance my skills have

703
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,080
some strength have some intelligence

704
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,240
have some luck have some vitality have

705
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,640
some agility and i had the the most

706
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,279
balanced character in the game but you

707
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,880
know what later on

708
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,520
it was just i my character became a joke

709
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,960
because you know

710
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,760
uh

711
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,120
being in a friend in a profession you

712
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,799
have to specialize in your profession if

713
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,960
you're if you're something that's uh if

714
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,919
you're a

715
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,360
a team for example specializing in

716
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,480
agility

717
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,400
let me specialize in strength same with

718
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,159
security you're doing penta specialize

719
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,600
in offensive one

720
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,960
of course you wanna you wanna learn the

721
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,799
fundamentals of the other things but

722
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,200
focus on on one

723
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,480
um

724
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,320
aim to fit a role that the company is

725
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,400
looking for so when you're when you're

726
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,400
going for for uh

727
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,880
for uh what i call this a job in cyber

728
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,840
security let's say you want to be uh a

729
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,000
researcher for example i know maybe it's

730
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,720
more safe for the pen tester for example

731
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,480
um you can't come to me and say that you

732
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,279
know

733
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,320
i am i i know all about um risk

734
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,679
management i know i know project

735
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,919
management i have been doing policies

736
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,760
and you have a lot of things but you

737
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,159
know the question is do you actually fit

738
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,279
what we're looking for what we're

739
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,360
looking for right now is someone who

740
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,480
who is you know well who knows how to do

741
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,720
pen tests you know who knows how to play

742
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,080
with the system

743
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,039
who knows his his his way around the

744
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:33,919
network

745
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,400
so focus on what role that you want and

746
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,559
uh

747
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,039
best way for it actually is

748
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,600
just get to the company profile check

749
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,720
out the

750
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,480
the job check out the certifications

751
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,080
what are you looking for it's usually

752
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,120
there and

753
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,080
go for it um

754
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,600
make sure that you are or seem to be

755
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,520
good enough to be taught or trained so

756
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,559
in the early stages i mean to be honest

757
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,400
we already accept the fact that uh

758
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,080
there's just not a lot of people or the

759
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,960
experience in security but you know what

760
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,279
we hope to do though if we are to be

761
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:13,039
accepting or hiring a candidate uh for

762
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,960
the entry position is that

763
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,960
you should at least be good enough to be

764
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,320
trained you should have that that

765
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,760
fundamental

766
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,320
like i said before i'm not i'm not gonna

767
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,159
hire you and pay you just to you know

768
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,240
spend a few months to train you and

769
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,559
we'll teach you you have to be you

770
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,159
should you have to have already that

771
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,000
that certain level of fundamentals for

772
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,600
us to to be caught or trained

773
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,840
um so that's education it's gonna run

774
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,600
through on experience

775
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,600
um so experience like i mentioned it

776
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,039
could be anything you don't have if you

777
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,400
don't have experience from the work

778
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,559
itself you can try it at home so always

779
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,559
try it at home set up your lab and it's

780
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,880
actually good i i do mean it you know

781
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,720
set up something there's been a time

782
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,919
where i would ask

783
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,919
um some some interviewers would even ask

784
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,000
you um we real tech interviewers would

785
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,880
ask you

786
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,799
what's your setup what's your computer

787
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:01,679
setup

788
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,520
if you can't even answer what your ram

789
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,919
is can't even even know how to

790
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,760
virtualize having put it i'm sorry to

791
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,200
say but you're not you're not gonna cut

792
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,159
it

793
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,799
uh but yeah always try at home practice

794
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,720
practice practice you forget that you

795
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,240
don't practice a lot of people as well

796
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,080
are you know they just read

797
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,240
um theory but they're not practicing it

798
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,279
trust me

799
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,399
when

800
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,640
during crunch time when you're when you

801
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,080
you have all the pressure if you're not

802
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,840
practicing it you will lose it

803
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,279
so yeah make sure to practice all the

804
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,720
time

805
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,279
join ctfs and hackathons so um there's

806
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,399
even a talk i remember uh on

807
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,399
one of the conferences about how how

808
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:39,600
cpfs and

809
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,440
hackathons are actually

810
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,480
uh are good or good practice for

811
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,480
for uh for security and the reason for

812
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,919
that is some of this uh challenges are

813
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,080
actually focused on the skills

814
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,919
that uh

815
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,600
a secret guy would need for example

816
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,520
creativity for example

817
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,440
um

818
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,080
a problem solving for example this this

819
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,679
all this stuff actually challenges you

820
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:04,880
and you know what

821
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,080
a lot of times uh the companies

822
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,559
you actually search for people who are

823
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,440
doing this city apps and hackathons

824
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,559
um

825
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,320
companies would even do hackathons just

826
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,960
to hire people so you can just

827
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,840
join them um

828
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,080
very important of course all of this

829
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,360
experience

830
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,880
uh you know on your early stages

831
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,880
and when you're applying for a job just

832
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,159
shows that you are passionate about

833
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,520
security i think that's the most

834
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,720
important thing

835
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,880
um i've been interviewing people

836
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,399
they want to

837
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,120
join the company but

838
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,840
they say that they've studied this they

839
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,640
you know they joined uh there was a

840
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,320
training in their school there's a

841
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,919
training in their company but when they

842
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:50,960
asked them

843
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,720
what did you do outside of work what did

844
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,960
you do outside of your school

845
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,320
that showed that you had passion for

885
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,200
small companies when you come in you

886
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,760
have to you know learn on your own you

887
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,200
have to set up the process on your own

888
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,720
you have to read up on your own and you

889
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,880
know if you're still new

890
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,880
where would you be drawing that that

891
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,279
knowledge right um

892
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,880
of course like i said big organizations

893
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,640
have have room to train

894
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,720
and uh

895
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,760
you'll have a chance to experience

896
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,960
different environments when you're when

897
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,159
you're doing consultancy um

898
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:35,279
you have a

899
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,559
chance to do

900
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,559
uh to perform service for different

901
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,080
clients um

902
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,360
so

903
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,039
by starting out

904
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,919
you'll normally have two types of offers

905
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,360
one is

906
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,640
um

907
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,600
doing security uh or you know being in

908
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,600
uh internal security operations which is

909
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,000
you know yours your part of the security

910
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,919
that protects the company

911
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,120
uh

912
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,519
second you'll be more into security

913
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,200
service providers those are usually the

914
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,039
two things you're the provider or you

915
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,840
are the ones uh doing internal security

916
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,159
and the advantage of being in the

917
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,080
provider side is that

918
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,760
you get experience different clients

919
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,640
different

920
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,000
implementations of security and you know

921
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,559
if if you're doing like uh i don't know

922
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,120
uh yeah research or pen test for example

923
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,440
you get to try out different enterprises

924
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,720
different

925
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,720
uh environments

926
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,480
whether it be in the cloud could be on

927
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,399
premise for example so there's just a

928
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:33,679
lot of things that you could you could

929
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,600
experience so i do

930
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,200
encourage those you know so i get no

931
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,880
offense for their guys but when you're

932
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,159
starting out i do advice it's my

933
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,760
personal advice

934
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,000
um

935
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,960
and

936
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,200
you know why i really push for this

937
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,640
because the reason for that is that when

938
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,840
you're starting out you need to know

939
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,600
what good looks like

940
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,360
you need to know what a good report

941
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,080
looks like you need to know what a a

942
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,000
good security team looks like you know

943
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,399
that you need to have a

944
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,640
flooding or an access control team you

945
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,320
have to have a fantasy you need to have

946
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,399
so in the smart companies

947
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,720
heckman security teams are even tied up

948
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,919
with with with their id so there's not a

949
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,760
lot of diligence but

950
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,440
when you have experience it in a bigger

951
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,399
company

952
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,320
you'll have understanding of what the

953
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,480
goal should be what what what good looks

954
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,240
like what a great

955
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,320
organization should look like in terms

956
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,960
of security

957
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,360
all right so

958
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,760

what others want to do very important um

963
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,200
a lot of times people would say that you

964
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,720
have to

965
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,720
you know you just have to do your thing

968
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:56,320

experience

975
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,399
it's also good when

976
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,559
uh for example if you're if you're not

977
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,720
within security yet you're still from

978
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,399
i.t and you want to join you know if you

979
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,159
have a chance to help out

980
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,000
uh do a task on

981
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,720

982
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,559
know that's that's uh added experience

983
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,159
and there's been a quote that they say

984
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,080
you know growth starts when you start

985
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,320
doing what you are not qualified

986
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,919
that's where you learn

987
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,480
okay uh don't be afraid to fail cliche

988
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,039
but

989
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,399
um

990
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,080
so that's experience side quick one

991
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,080
certification this has been uh there

992
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,039
have been a lot of talks and

993
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,960
certifications just wanna give a run

994
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,919
through it um certification it's okay to

995
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,919
get the basic search when starting out

996
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,840
but shoot for the major ones asap so

997
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,279
these are one of the things that i see a

998
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,519
lot of of you guys

999
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,120
uh you know

1000
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,240
do which is

1001
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,720
for example they they done for they feel

1002
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,720
that they need to to have some

1003
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,240
some certificate to validate their

1004
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,840
skills so they can get for example they

1005
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,760
go for a

1006
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,599
security class for example and now

1007
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,839
they've passed it they want to do

1008
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,320
ch and they want to do as a cp they want

1009
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,119
to do

1010
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,359
they they're trying to they're investing

1011
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,960
a lot of this

1012
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,320
of this basic certifications and uh

1013
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,000
by doing this of course it takes time it

1014
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,639
takes money and to be honest

1015
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,359
if you have one or two or three doesn't

1016
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,320
really matter as long as you compare to

1017
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,359
having one so for me

1018
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,599
start one so that get one so you could

1019
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,159
you could get into the job that you want

1020
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,679
but if you have a chance you have the

1021
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,520

1036
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,560
as soon as you can

1037
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,599
um

1038
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,760
it's also a very important tip when when

1039
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,960
you're starting out

1040
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,599
ask the company if they if they are they

1041
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,359
would sponsor uh

1042
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,440
uh certifications

1043
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,320
and to really be good you know here in

1044
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,760
the philippines

1045
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,119
certifications are expensive for us

1046
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,320
because like i said we're not earning

1047
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,400
dollars right so if you have companies

1048
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,680
that are willing to pay for

1049
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,040
certifications

1050
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,280
and you you already have the passion to

1051
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,960
take them you know just go for it we're

1052
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,359
starting out anyway so if they're gonna

1053
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,119
give you a bond of one year what the

1054
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,800
heck man you're just starting out so

1055
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,400
first day on the

1056
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,560
on on your company take the certificate

1057
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,680
get one

1058
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,920
get that one year bond and

1059
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,599
spend the one year one and after what up

1060
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,839
to you but like i said

1061
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,160
uh take take note of this um

1062
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,599
very important they don't aim to pass

1063
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,640
but aim to learn you may fail but some

1064
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,880
some guys and let's just be honest right

1065
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,720
there a lot of knowledge dumps there's a

1066
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,599
lot of dumps out there for you to pass a

1067
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,440
certain certification

1068
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,079
and but i tell you it's very important

1069
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,720
you know to just to really aim to

1070
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,640
understand those concepts those

1071
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,480
certifications were designed

1072
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,400
to teach you the important concept that

1073
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,800
you need um but if you're just here to

1074
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,240
pass it

1075
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,839
yeah you may get a certification but

1076
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:34,160
once you get into a real interview and

1077
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,160
you know you're being interviewed by

1078
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,839
real hackers

1079
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,000
you know your your your your your

1080
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,320
 whatever really is shown so

1081
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,320
yeah make sure that you you've learned

1082
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,680
whatever certification that you have

1083
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,839
um certification don't go uh don't rush

1084
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,880
go for one year one one or two a year

1085
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,720
why there's there's more to life than

1086
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,960
search man a lot i mean offensive to

1087
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,720
those guys who've been getting searched

1088
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,480
every single time that's good for you

1089
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,359
you can if you could take it but uh you

1090
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:06,480
know

1091
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,599
security is is a very long journey

1092
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,320
you need to avoid burnout so take it one

1093
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,720
at a time and of course um

1094
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,320
like like any other learning right you

1095
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,720
need some time in between to digest what

1096
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,320
you have learned and digest and you know

1097
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,760
practice what you'll you

1098
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,079
for going to the next one and if you are

1099
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,320
like like i said if you're starting out

1100
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,119
for like you know 22 23 even four

1101
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,440
one one or two a year by 30 how many

1102
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,119
searches do you have right so

1103
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,839
there's no need to

1104
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:37,200
rush um

1105
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,040
also some some trick that i would like

1106
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,240
to share with you

1107
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,839
cert diminishing returns um

1108
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,160
a lot like a lot of guys go for a lot of

1109
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,240
search which is no problem i respect

1110
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,560
that but to be honest two or three major

1111
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,880
search is good enough beyond that it

1112
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,480
doesn't really matter

1113
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,240
dollar wise or it doesn't really matter

1114
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,480
on you know getting the position

1115
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,480
if you have like five

1116
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,240
all penta certs

1117
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,960
or or you know uh

1118
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,599
um forensic search or whatever right

1119
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:08,800
uh

1120
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,880
it would it won't matter too much

1121
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,800
compared to when you have two or three

1122
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,440
so it's just go for a few and if you

1123
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,119
want

1124
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,839
uh no problem at all um some people they

1125
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,240
so some people they do beyond that

1126
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,760
because you know it's all about their

1127
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,280
fulfillment and challenge and go for

1128
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,480
that i said i totally respect that um

1129
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,760
but

1130
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,839
the major thing here is that you know

1131
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,440
getting five search and applying for the

1132
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,200
job it will just be the same

1133
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,280
you have to because like i said it's

1134
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,079
just a it's just uh

1135
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,920
what they call this a proof or a badge

1136
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,119
that you have the capability you know

1137
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,880
but towards the end it is your

1138
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,440
experience that we will

1139
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,920
get you to the next level okay so that

1140
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,520
certification

1141
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,520
um if if you want to know more about it

1142
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,960
i won't be dwelling too much on it but

1143
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,280
here's the roadmap there's a roadmap

1144
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,119
search for it in google

1145
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,800
uh by now you should know how to search

1146
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,160
man but uh it's there's a link here

1147
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,079
but uh check it out i like this older

1148
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,160
version there's a newer one but yeah

1149
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,200
that's the certification roadmap

1150
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,560
uh

1151
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,320
just a quote again never give up always

1152
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,800
try harder oscp try harder

1153
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,079
so

1154
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,800
yep um

1155
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,839
so

1156
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,160
just just to share this uh

1157
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,760
um they say that when you're getting

1158
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,280
certifications you're getting a job

1159
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,960
right uh

1160
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,640
they say that

1161
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,880
uh

1162
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,119
if you if you do it a lot of times more

1163
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,640
then you'll have a lot of

1164
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,960
more chances of being successful so i

1165
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,480
just wanted to share this there's this

1166
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,200
guy right that uh i've been applying for

1167
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,079
for one of my teams uh for spider labs

1168
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:50,880
actually he failed like four times

1169
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,800
you know he applied four times got

1170
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,560
interviewed four times

1171
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,440
in span of i think two years or a year

1172
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,480
he didn't give up you know and then the

1173
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,079
fifth one if i remember fourth or fifth

1174
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,560
one he passed because he learned during

1175
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,119
the during the wave and he tried harder

1176
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,440
and he got it but he served him you know

1177
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,400
so

1178
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,200
just just don't give up you know

1179
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,880
so

1180
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,800
that's it

1181
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,119
so that's that's that's the early stages

1182
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,440
and i'm just gonna browse uh uh of

1183
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,960
course real quick with the other stuff

1184
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,000
here but uh mid game

1185
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,280
so mid game

1186
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,560
so you didn't you already have

1187
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,400
experience already have a job you know

1188
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,720
what do i need to do to progress or i'm

1189
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,400
ready on a different role i want to go

1190
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,240
to the next row what are the things that

1191
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,000
i need to focus on so

1192
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,200
in games you would say that there are a

1193
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,839
lot of proficiencies like magic

1194
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:45,839
or i don't know combat

1195
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,359
same with security

1196
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,119
you have your tech skills functional

1197
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,000
knowledge and personal abilities so uh

1198
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,240
but when you uh when you

1199
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,400
uh go further in security it's not just

1200
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,160
gonna be about tech skills first time

1201
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,960
you need to it uh

1202
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,280
you need to learn a lot more

1203
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,480
and uh

1204
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,359
to be honest it's one of the things that

1205
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:10,480
the reason why well a lot of tech guys

1206
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,160
fail during your interviews or doing

1207
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,000
promotions because they don't have these

1208
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,520
other things

1209
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,920
and that's why a lot of you know guys

1210
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,160
who just focus on tech just don't get to

1211
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,599
move back

1212
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:22,319
but

1213
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,400
so for you to really move to the next

1214
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,280
level you have to have all this focus on

1215
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,640
those three things

1216
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,520
so first off tech skills

1217
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,240
so

1218
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,839
you already know what text closure just

1219
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:36,480
you know your your technical

1220
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,720
knowledge but uh but at this time the

1221
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,200
mid game you need to know a little

1222
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,760
more about everything

1223
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,680
but be a master of one

1224
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,839
um at this stage if for example if

1225
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,839
you're doing like if you're a researcher

1226
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:50,880
for example

1227
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,800
you're in the blue team at this point in

1228
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,480
time you should already be growing your

1229
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,960
knowledge in a way that you also know

1230
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,920
how

1231
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,160
the the red team works you also know how

1232
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,800
a hacker would do it right or if you're

1233
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,400
if you're a pen tester you should also

1234
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,119
already try to learn how how does a a

1235
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,200
blue team try to defend the company so

1236
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,920
but still specialize in one be a master

1237
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,400
of one be known for one like you know we

1238
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,680
ask you well

1239
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,240
what's your own security you know i'm uh

1240
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,880
i'm i'm a fan tester i'm a researcher

1241
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,319
i'm uh

1242
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,160
i'm a

1243
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,920
software engineer for example but you'll

1244
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,280
be a master been known for one

1245
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,599
um the important take notes make them

1246
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,520
handy so like i said we're on the mid

1247
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,720
game we started very important is

1248
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,760
you know build that cheat sheet of yours

1249
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,240
as you move between companies you learn

1250
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,560
methodologies you learn stuff

1251
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,040
always have that knowledge base you know

1252
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,640
develop that knowledge base develop your

1253
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,119
methodology how you do things how you

1254
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,560
and improve that methodology make it

1255
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,440
more efficient that's very important

1256
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,880
every time you do an engagement you

1257
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,800
shouldn't be going to google again you

1258
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,200
already have your your your flow that's

1259
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,560
what you need to develop to develop

1260
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,040
moving on

1261
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,359
and develop your tool set so

1262
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:10,560
like i said uh uh at the the mid stage

1263
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,960
of of your career when you if you want

1264
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,720
to go to the next level you should

1265
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,359
already be focusing on your on your

1266
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:19,839
tools you know so there's a lot of tools

1267
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:22,480
out there you don't have to do you know

1268
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,200
to master everything just choose a tool

1269
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,920
and you know master it what do i mean by

1270
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,800
that

1271
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,079
know that uh feel comfortable using it

1272
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:33,680
know the syntax know what the

1273
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,440
limitations are know

1274
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,520
when to use that that tool for what

1275
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,720
situation

1276
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,400
so that's what you need to do and you

1277
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,079
could like i said there's no perfect

1278
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,640
tool there's no one to rule them on

1279
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,440
you just have to you know

1280
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,560
um

1281
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,720
build up on different tools uh know

1282
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,839
which tool that you're going to use for

1283
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,760
each situation you have a whole new set

1284
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,079
of words okay so make sure to build on

1285
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,200
that

1286
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,560
functional knowledge what is functional

1287
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,160
knowledge uh

1288
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,000
emotional knowledge is about

1289
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,079
the other things outside of security you

1290
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:07,599
know to not just about your tech skills

1291
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,040
you also have other knowledge for

1292
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,400
example uh

1293
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,160
you know knowledge of of general

1294
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,800
security so my tip there get a good

1295
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,280
source of security input fees

1296
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,240
get uh you know subscribe i'll do it uh

1297
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,880
join linkedin follow some people there

1298
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,119
uh twitter follow some people there link

1299
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,760
in even reddit man if you want to but uh

1300
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,640
yeah just have some uh some some source

1301
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,520
of feed for for your security knowledge

1302
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,880
like the news

1303
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,640
what what are the trends you know in

1304
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,040
security right now what are the the

1305
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,200
challenges for example

1306
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,560
um

1307
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,640
so yeah

1308
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,240
again very important as well to develop

1309
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,079
later on learn the other domains of

1310
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:51,280
security so

1311
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,119
you know a lot of guys

1312
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,040
i've seen a lot of people or

1313
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,040
security but they don't even know you're

1314
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,720
not familiar with the governance part

1315
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,400
you're not familiar with risk management

1316
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,280
security standards and

1317
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,880
uh you should understand that when

1318
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,920
you're dealing with clients we're

1319
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,680
dealing with stakeholders these are

1320
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,040
they're actually

1321
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,560
other things that they're they are

1322
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,880
considering like for example a company

1323
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,800
for example they might be asking your

1324
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,319
help because they need to pass

1325
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:20,640
pci dss or

1326
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,920
um you know i saw something they want to

1327
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,079
pass that and for you to to better help

1328
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:28,800
them and you should at least

1329
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,000
have some knowledge in these other

1330
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,760
domains right

1331
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,480
have some knowledge on um the

1332
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,880
development cycle for example

1333
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,319
you know those are important things for

1334
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,440
you to

1335
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,720
do

1336
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:45,359
to uh move to the next level in security

1337
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,440
um learn about the industry you of the

1338
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,760
company you are working for so

1339
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,520
um especially if you're doing uh

1340
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,480
internal internal uh cp operations this

1341
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,119
is very important like again for you to

1342
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,119

move up

1345
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,000
you should also understand

1346
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:04,960
uh

1347
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,800
the industry that you're working for if

1353
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,280
should be the bloopers the blueprints

1354
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,800
will be important for them if you're in

1355
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,880
the development company to understand

1356
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,040
what's uh what what

1357
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,280
what the the product you're carrying is

1358
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,599
the software development cycle is

1359
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,520
this it is on this way that you are able

1360
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,839
to better help them as a consultant as

1361
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:34,800
well

1362
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,839
um

1363
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:37,280
you're talking with different clients if

1364
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,800
you understand their

1365
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,359
their industry you understand what what

1366
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:44,319
they value they're able to provide more

1367
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,160
meaningful uh

1368
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,640
advice or recommendation and you know be

1369
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,800
able to provide a better perspective in

1370
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,839
terms of

1371
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:54,319
uh security for their industry

1372
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:55,680
so yeah very important for you to

1373
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,078
progress

1374
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,280
so again to the next level you need to

1375
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,680
learn to communicate risk into dollars

1376
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,720
so

1377
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,960
what do i mean by this um a lot of times

1378
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,280
when we present findings we come to your

1379
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,359
your boss and say no

1380
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,720
we have a critical finding uh there's uh

1381
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,359
uh your our system is

1382
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:19,599
uh you know there's an information

1383
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,839
disclosure possible leak

1384
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,559
and blah blah blah and you've been asked

1385
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:27,359
to present on the board of directors you

1386
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:28,880
talk about all this stress to your

1387
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,359
company you have a long report to be

1388
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,680
honest they won't they won't even care

1389
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,200
they'll just be strolling to their cell

1390
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,040
phone the whole time but if you talk

1391
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,720
about you know

1392
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,119
uh it is our risk

1393
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,440
if if you don't patch this

1394
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,559
you will lose

1395
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:46,319
one million dollars for example and

1396
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,480
trust me they'll like what the heck what

1397
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,559
do you need for us to fix that

1398
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,760
so learn to communicate risk into

1399
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,359
the dollars and how do you do that like

1400
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:56,319
i said

1401
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,400
understand your industry understand the

1402
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,359
company

1403
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:02,000
so you could you know convert

1404
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,079
your security findings into something

1405
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:05,680
more valuable

1406
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,359
okay

1407
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:08,640
so um

1408
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,839
other stuff

1409
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,040
other functional knowledge that will

1410
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,359
help you later on learn manage how to

1411
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:15,680
manage projects you know investigation

1412
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,559
learn to manage stakeholders so again

1413
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:20,000
when you're working you're not just

1414
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,359
working on your own you're just not

1415
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,200
hacking a system you are actually

1416
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,000
working with different teams there are

1417
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
different stakeholders there's a lot of

1418
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,520
recipients for

1419
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,200
for your output right so you need to be

1420
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,559
able to understand

1421
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:34,720
and be able to work with them

1422
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,760
um

1423
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,839
learn to manage finances

1424
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:39,040
so

1425
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,119
this is more for for security management

1426
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,480
like your own understand budget's

1427
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,240
billings and purchases for same

1428
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,440
decisions

1429
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,680
so again outside of security if you want

1430
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,800
to go

1431
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,720
uh move to the next level learn about

1432
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,319
these things as well

1433
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,079
so that's for um

1434
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:55,440
uh you know

1435
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,200
knowledge parts so let's move to

1436
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,280
personal ability so first abilities is

1437
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,160
about

1438
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,440
you as a person right so um what what do

1439
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,960
i mean by this you know

1440
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,880
outside of game just a tech guy you need

1441
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,720
to develop your personality and

1442
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,960
interpersonal skills so

1443
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,599
um a lot of guys in security

1444
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,599
um i would say a good i don't know 80 90

1445
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,760
percent i'm just generalizing but a lot

1446
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,000
of guys are introverts

1447
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,640
you know and um

1448
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,079
and you may not believe me but i do i'm

1449
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,640
an introvert 60 70 i did the test

1450
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,559
so there's a lot of people

1451
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,319
that are introverts

1452
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:34,960
and it's not a problem at all it's it's

1453
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,599
actually you know it's uh

1454
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,079
it's actually also good in a way right

1455
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,720
but uh you have to also even if you're

1456
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,559
an introvert you need to develop you

1457
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:45,440
know

1458
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,160
that uh that interpersonal skills being

1459
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,160
able to work and communicate with other

1460
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,760
teams then like i said you'll be working

1461
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,960
with teams

1462
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,800
and uh if you're just on your on your

1463
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,079
silo

1464
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:57,680
you won't be able to progress when

1465
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,400
you're when you're

1466
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,800
investigating a breach for example if

1467
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,040
you're investigating a certain

1468
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,040
uh

1469
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,040
incident you have to work with different

1470
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,559
teams you have to work with you have to

1471
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:12,079
work with your id you have to work with

1472
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:13,359
other people

1473
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:16,799
so you need to develop that as well

1474
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:19,680
develop your communication skills

1475
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,280
very important

1476
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,400
um

1477
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,599
i have a lot of people that

1478
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,599
are really good they were really good

1479
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:29,920
but uh they just can't communicate and

1480
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,000
explain themselves when when they do

1481
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,680
append us they could find the findings

1482
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,760
you know they would get that that that

1483
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,680
that vulnerability but they just can't

1484
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,640
communicate and it's hard for me as

1485
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,559
someone as a hiring manager for example

1486
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,079
to give this guy a chance because at the

1487
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:45,520
end of the day

1488
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,400
you know

1489
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,480
um so at the end of the day

1490
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,119
the work that we do as a security is you

1491
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:54,640
know we are all about helping people and

1492
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,200
no matter how good your your finding is

1493
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,599
if you can communicate that the person

1494
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:01,520
tell them how they could fix it or how

1495
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,520
they could you know work on it if you

1496
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,359
can't communicate that doesn't really

1497
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:06,319
matter

1498
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:09,440
there's no value to it and

1499
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,000
also the the the trend right now

1500
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,240
uh in in the in the country is that a

1501
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,680
lot of uh

1502
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,960
companies that you know try to

1503
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,960
to hire people from the philippines but

1504
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,800
of course because we are

1505
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,800
we are um more

1506
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,800
a bit cheaper in a way which is actually

1507
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,720
an advantage for us

1508
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,280
but uh they do require it you know uh

1509
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,640
companies from the us for example they

1510
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,240
hire people from here

1511
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,240
and uh but they want of course for you

1512
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,079
to learn to communicate

1513
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:39,599
in english you know

1514
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,280
so

1515
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,760
so i'm not saying that you have to

1516
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,880
really

1517
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,040
be a good communicator

1518
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,720
but if you do

1519
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,720
if you do improve your communication

1520
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,920
skills i trust you i mean i tell you

1521
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,079
you'll really go a long way so that's

1522
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:58,079
very important

1523
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:59,920
so but of course there are other things

1524
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,839
like a couple of my guys would use like

1525
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:04,160
a translator or you know i'm sure like

1526
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,839
what tool that they have montgomery or

1527
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:07,119
something you could work on that but

1528
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:08,720
like i said

1529
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,079
you need uh

1530
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:11,839
you spend a lot of effort

1531
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:12,960
um

1532
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,640
working on your tech skills hacking

1533
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,839
skills

1534
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:17,520
but if you could also spend just a bit

1535
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,880
more time in your communications you get

1536
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,880
to a level that you can

1537
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,559
that you are able to communicate your

1538
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,440
thoughts then you go a long way

1539
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,599
learn to ask questions we are in that

1540
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,359
industry we have the certain pride you

1541
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:31,040
know to ask questions it's very

1542
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,040
important it's faster if you ask

1543
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,440
questions

1544
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,000
develop your report writing skills so a

1545
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,319
lot of people would say that you know

1546
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,720
um so a lot of people would imagine the

1547
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,720
work in security to be this awesome work

1548
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,240
of us just being in the terminal and

1549
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,520
doing our things

1550
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,599
but in all honesty if you ask the

1551
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,520
professionals out there

1552
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,720
we have to write reports man and

1553
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,839
for you to

1554
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,359
move further you also need to develop

1555
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:59,599
your writing skills like i said no

1556
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:01,359
matter how good you were with hacking if

1557
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:04,720
you can put it into something that

1558
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,480
could report into a document that you

1559
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,200
know

1560
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,960
your stakeholder your boss or your

1561
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,359
client is able to understand then you

1562
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:13,280
know there's no value to it so very

1563
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,200
important

1564
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,480
um

1565
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,200
almost towards the end but yeah uh

1566
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,280
develop a lot and i do mean a lot of

1567
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,839
patience um this is very important uh

1568
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:27,920
in security a lot of the guys are you

1569
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,800
know hackers are really smart you know

1570
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,400
they are very

1571
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,920
quick with it you know

1572
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,160
high iqs which is good

1573
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,200
but

1574
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,520
not a lot not not everyone

1575
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,599
has that same iq as yours not everyone

1576
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:43,680
has the same understanding and when

1577
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,599
you're when you're working with them

1578
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,960
to be honest sometimes you just don't

1579
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,640
understand and it can be you know it can

1580
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,480
be frustrating but you need to learn

1581
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,440
that

1582
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,280
if you are able to help your boss

1583
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,040
understand and i tell you um to do a lot

1584
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,880
of things for you know but uh yeah

1585
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,319
develop that patience very important

1586
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:06,000
um your clients are usually stupid

1587
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,480
so you have to be able to have that

1588
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,160
patience to work with them help them out

1589
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:14,399
and will do a lot of well for you

1590
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,680
um so yeah that's for personal abilities

1591
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:18,880
so

1592
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:21,520
remember that uh you know the race in

1593
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,400
cyber security is not a sprint

1594
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,520
this is actually a marathon so

1595
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,680
in insecurity it's not about it's not

1596
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,760
about being fast learning a lot of

1597
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,760
things real quick

1598
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,920
but it's about surviving the journey

1599
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,359
it's a very long journey man you have

1600
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:38,960
this you have to study every single day

1601
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,599
you have to spin up that that vm every

1602
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:43,760
time you need to try out that

1603
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,160
you need to try out that

1604
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,200
exploit that just came out every time

1605
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,480
like in the games you would call this

1606
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,400
that there's a stage in your security

1607
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,079
career that you call it a grind you're

1608
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:56,799
just grinding man it's doing you you're

1609
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:59,520
doing things over and over again but uh

1610
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,280
you know there are a couple of ways for

1611
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,799
you to survive this

1612
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,280
you could you know just

1613
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,680
uh have that

1614
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,359
discipline yourself in a way that you

1615
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:10,640
could really

1616
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,720
uh have a system of how you're going to

1617
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:13,920
continuously

1618
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,720
study and do your thing or

1619
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,880
you know just really have that inner

1620
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,040
passion so there are two things

1621
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,760
um a lot of times the people who survive

1622
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,920
security are the ones that has passion

1623
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,440
on them you know

1624
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,400
so

1625
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,920
yeah that's that's the a lot of people

1626
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,599
who want to come in but they're not

1627
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:32,720
they're not enjoying it they're not

1628
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,559

01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,599
point in time and you know

1838
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:40,640
you're not

1839
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,400
uh you're not really sure if you have

1840
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,799
what it takes or not you know you feel

1841
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:46,799
that a lot of people are not

1842
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:48,400
they will tell you that you are not good

1843
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,880
enough you don't really know your thing

1844
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,559
but when you're you're giving a talk

1845
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:53,839
when you're presenting you'll have that

1846
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:56,559
feeling that do i really deserve it

1847
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:59,520
uh do i really have the knowledge to

1848
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,960
to you know

1849
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,720
to teach people

1850
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,039
or maybe because you know a lot a lot of

1851
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:07,920
guys may be better than me so i i can't

1852
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,520

1853
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,599

1855
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:15,359

1888
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:16,799
um

1889
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:18,960
security especially

1890
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,760
um in the philippines it's it's it's

1891
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,839
it's still very small still very young

1892
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:26,240
we know people and if you've been an ass

1893
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,839

1894
01:04:27,839 --> 01:04:29,280
wherever you go

1895
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,280
people will probably know you to be an

1896
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,240
ass

1897
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,000
of course if you are really good and you

1898
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,760
can survive on your own

1899
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,559
you have what it takes go ahead

1900
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:42,079
but uh you know it's still a lot better

1901
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:45,280
if you have if you're if not everyone is

1902
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,359
hates you

1903
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:50,000
don't be an ass all right so

1904
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,920
um before i end

1905
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:54,559
so when when i was when i was uh

1906
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:56,240
thinking about how

1907
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,240
how presenting this this

1908
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:01,280
this topic right uh i was thinking about

1909
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,440
what are the the ways to present it but

1910
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,000
i was thinking so i realized you know

1911
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,440
i thought about just presenting it as a

1912
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,039
game and whoa

1913
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:11,280
why did i choose to present it as a game

1914
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,599
because you know

1915
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:16,240
uh it's because of my last advice most

1916
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,760
important advice

1917
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,839
um i've been in this field for so long

1918
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:21,599
um

1919
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:23,920
and uh trust me when i tell you it is it

1920
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:24,559
is

1921
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:26,799
as as you move into the latter part over

1922
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:28,559
here it's not gonna be easy man it's

1923
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:30,640
gonna be it's gonna be a long journey

1924
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,400
you know a lot of times it could be

1925
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,359
empty

1926
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:35,280
a lot of times it will be you know could

1927
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,319
be tiring you know doing your thing over

1928
01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:39,680
and over again

1929
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,119
studying and being updated with

1930
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:43,039
technology every single day

1931
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,280
you know it's really you work a lot of

1932
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,119
times you know

1933
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:48,000
and

1934
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,119
sometimes you know if you're not careful

1935
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:52,559
you're you'll you'll

1936
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:53,839
you'll burn out

1937
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:55,280
and so i guess

1938
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,799
that's why i chose to pretend it's a

1939
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:59,119
game is because

1940
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:01,760
uh security should be something that

1941
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,400
should defeat us again b should always

1942
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,000
remember to have fun

1943
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,440
you know

1944
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,520
um like i said

1945
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:10,720
it's it's

1946
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:11,680
the

1947
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,640
uh security is it's more of a marathon

1948
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:17,039
than a sprint and you have to and you

1949
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:19,039
have to have that that skill to survive

1950
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:20,240
this journey

1951
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,160
it can be exciting at first but later on

1952
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,839
man you will be

1953
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:25,760
you you want to vomit with all just you

1954
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,520
know moving past every single day but

1955
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,039
and the only way for you to survive this

1956
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:30,640
you know remember to always have fun

1957
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,160
remember where you started remember when

1958
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,799
you when you went into security remember

1959
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:36,880
that passion that's what will

1960
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,960
get you into the long run

1961
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,200
get you to the top is you know to be at

1962
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,359
the top is not the people at top are not

1963
01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:45,280
the people who are just the best of

1964
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:46,640
everything

1965
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:47,839
these are the people actually survived

1966
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:50,640
the journey survived the marathon man

1967
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:54,000
so remember always remember to have fun

1968
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:54,960
and

1969
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,200
so yeah that's that's really it for me

1970
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:00,000
um that's uh you know i hope i was able

1971
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,960
to

1972
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:04,079
to uh to give some some insight and uh

1973
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:06,160
you know it was more of a brain dump of

1974
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,520
everything that

1975
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,440
i've learned and what has worked for me

1976
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,280
and uh and i do hope that you're able to

1977
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,200
take something out of it and you know

1978
