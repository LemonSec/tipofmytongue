1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,640
good morning everyone uh welcome to day

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,880
two of rook com15

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,559
first of all i would like to thank uh

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,559
the rookon team for inviting me to speak

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,440
at rook on fifteen uh it's an absolute

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,800
pleasure to be delivering to this

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,039
keynote uh fortunately i can't be with

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,760
all of you uh physically this year um

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,920
but i'll be around this court uh so hit

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,920
me up uh come say hi

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,000
um i'd love to talk about anything and

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,880
all things cybersecurity

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,640
as much as my title suggests about

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,640
hacking the planet i'm not going to talk

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,200
about hacking the latest technology that

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,440
is empowering our digital world

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,040
so nothing fancy about quantum or ai or

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,360
autonomous vehicles or even blockchain

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,000
right um i'm however going to talk about

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,600
um something a little bit more primitive

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,640
than this

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,440
and i'm i'm going to talk about uh cyber

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,719
security

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,559
right um well we are in a separate

25
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,000
pre-conference so what else am i gonna

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,239
talk about right um

27
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,239
but uh more specifically i'm going to

28
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,879
talk about the security aspects of what

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,640
we are securing in cyber security

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,439
um

31
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,920
um i know i'm reading a couple of slides

32
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,119
in uh

33
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,640
and i still haven't really

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,680
introduced myself properly um i am yotan

35
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,880
uh rukon uh has my bio you can check it

36
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,400
out uh you can also find me on twitter

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,680
and linkedin

38
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,840
so i'm not gonna go into details on my

39
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,280
profile

40
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,360
i'm kind of everywhere here and there in

41
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,280
multiple pockets of time and space in

42
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,200
the cybersecurity universe

43
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,360
to put it simply i usually just say i

44
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,360
work in south security

45
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,439
you're also here today because you are

46
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,960
working selfish greedy or something

47
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,479
subscribing or

48
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,000
uh just you know interested in cyber

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,399
security uh i've done various different

50
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,799
things in the field of service grady uh

51
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,079
rnd dfir grc

52
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,880
the whole range of alphabet soup uh and

53
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,240
terminologies

54
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,399
uh and i'm sure you have already seen

55
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,799
that experience uh yesterday as well as

56
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,600
uh

57
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,799
uh us you know do more even today uh and

58
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:05,840
rupon

59
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,920
experience the vibrancy of the the field

60
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,000
and ecosystem of cyber security right

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,760
there are just so many elements uh

62
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,640
domains and technology areas to explore

63
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,959
right ranging from cyber defense to vm

64
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,520
technology to automotive security

65
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,319
malware hunting authentication bypassing

66
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,640
fuzzing software security and many many

67
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,520
more

68
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,560
right

69
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,200
i'm sure you agree it's hard to get

70
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,440
bored in this field

71
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,599
there's always so much to see so much to

72
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,120
learn and

73
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,519
so much to get your hands on right but

74
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,920
somehow right with all these diversity

75
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,440
of things that we are doing

76
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,959
we are converged into this magical world

77
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,120
called cybersecurity right so what

78
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,040
exactly is our security what are we

79
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,640
doing um

80
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,640
are we even doing it correctly

81
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,360
right

82
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,120
so for those who are there physically

83
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,319
you know in the philippines at the

84
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,480
conference uh look to your left

85
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,840
and now look your right um

86
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,239
and and we are probably all doing

87
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,720
different things in in cyber security

88
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,360
right uh and and we might even have

89
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,879
various different views and very

90
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,040
differing views on what cyber security

91
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,400
really is

92
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,760
um so with us doing all these things all

93
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,879
these diversity of things are we making

94
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,680
cyberspace the digital world or even the

95
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,680
planet a better

96
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,720
safer

97
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,560
or more secure place by doing whatever

98
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,959
we are doing

99
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,040
so to answer these questions uh for many

100
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,760
years i went on a mission uh a hunt uh

101
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,480
and many uh rabbit holes trying to

102
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,959
understand selfish greedy i did dive

103
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,400
into many disciplines trying to

104
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
understand the field

105
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,920
and i

106
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,640
truly believe to understand uh something

107
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,040
to truly understand something we we need

108
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,959
to break everything down

109
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,000
and rebuild it up again right hence

110
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,239
for me to to truly understand what cyber

111
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,560
security is i spend a lot of time

112
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,599
studying

113
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,640
um all the different perspectives across

114
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,799
uh disciplines

115
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,439
i'm not going to dive into every

116
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,840
uh single pixel of details of the

117
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,120
research i've done

118
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,759
um what i'll be doing instead is i will

119
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,880
briefly

120
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,720
really really briefly cover some bits of

121
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,320
my research

122
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,639
which explains why when i'm truly honest

123
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,160
with myself

124
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,759
why i don't like to say that i work in

125
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,000
cybersecurity uh as part of my

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,199
introduction

127
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,840
and maybe uh you'll be like me uh as

128
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,320
well by the end of the talk

129
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,800
uh do note that uh because i'm just

130
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,199
scraping the surface

131
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,360
of of the research i've done i'll be

132
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,919
generalizing some uh concepts uh but

133
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,199
still

134
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,160
i'll come i'll cover just deep enough uh

135
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,720
for all of us to reflect upon

136
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,360
our importance uh in the field of

137
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,840
cybersecurity

138
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,880
speaking of breaking everything down

139
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,720
right um before building it back up

140
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,199
again uh first we need to ask ourselves

141
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,720
what is security

142
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,039
right according to doxwell dictionary um

143
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,199
is the state of being free

144
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,440
from danger of threat right although we

145
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,919
can relate this state to our day-to-day

146
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,360
feelings of being safe and not

147
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,919
threatened uh it is challenging to

148
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,919
interpret uh this definition in the

149
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,400
context across disciplines everyone

150
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,320
interprets it differently

151
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,440
right

152
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,919
when you did dive into security and

153
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,560
rightly so there is a heavy sovereign

154
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,639
and military context to it

155
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,880
on politics or international relations

156
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,039
and well everything you know falls under

157
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,320
the big umbrella of national security

158
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,400
historically speaking uh this notion of

159
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,320
national security uh were heavily

160
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,560
associated with like i mentioned earlier

161
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,720
sovereignty and and it's understood in

162
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,800
military terms right

163
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,280
but recently this whole notion uh it's

164
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,160
it's shaken up right it's because

165
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,479
it's a whole new world out there in the

166
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,960
past few decades right um the majority

167
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,080
of the world is somewhat peaceful

168
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,360
um well relatively so as compared to say

169
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,680
one or two centuries ago

170
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,600
right and and that's because the world

171
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,360
and because of this you know the world

172
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,400
is majority peaceful again relatively so

173
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,360
um we have more time to care about other

174
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,840
things beyond military strength right we

175
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,440
have time to care about things like

176
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,080
economics and you know deep dive and

177
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,600
think more and think harder about

178
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,840
economics and social vitalities of

179
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,919
nations and because of this uh since the

180
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,039
cold war

181
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,120
even more so after the fall of berlin

182
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,360
war uh national security agendas were

183
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,680
broadened uh from strictly

184
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,240
focusing on security of sovereignty to

185
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,120
include security of people

186
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,000
right

187
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,319
um lots of security scholars and policy

188
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,120
makers were mental on this progress and

189
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,840
many subjects were proposed uh to be

190
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,080
considered national security issues

191
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,759
right and it reached a point that

192
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,280
security became

193
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,560
a synonym for everything that is good or

194
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,919
desirable

195
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,199
and that's actually not a very good

196
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,000
thing at all um definitely not for cyber

197
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,240
security and we'll see why later

198
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,080
so we can't we can't define cyber

199
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,479
security or we can't define security

200
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,520
right at this stage um but

201
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,759
to build the concept back up we still

202
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,800
need to understand security or at least

203
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,919
understand the concept of security

204
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,000
right so security scholars or academies

205
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,080
researching into international security

206
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,840
agendas and development

207
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,919
they propose to engage this problem by

208
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:40,800
asking

209
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,240
three questions

210
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,560
what is it that is being secured what

211
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,440
constitutes the condition of security

212
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,440
and how do ideas

213
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,160
about security develop right so the

214
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,080
first two questions were

215
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,919
found to be either too ambiguous or too

216
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,280
difficult to determine

217
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,919
and impossible to appraise

218
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,919
but the last question the third question

219
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,680
here

220
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,120
which seeks to understand how security

221
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,560
agendas will develop

222
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,879
or how or more

223
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,720
technically how

224
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,680
agendas were securitized

225
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,560
this was seen as the key to explain the

226
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,039
concept of security

227
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,680
so since then securitization right this

228
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,759
process securitization

229
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,160
that is the development process and

230
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,000
study of the establishments and

231
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,919
formulation of security agendas

232
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,559
have since has since been the focal

233
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,799
point of security studies among security

234
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,640
theories and academias

235
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,000
what well it is natural uh to assume

236
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,080
that the seriousness of a threat

237
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,399
perceived by say the government or

238
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,800
military or country or nation state

239
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
is directly reflected in its national

240
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,480
security agendas or national security

241
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,080
policy

242
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,160
interestingly it's found that no you

243
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,399
know is that there's no such correlation

244
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,399
was found at all

245
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,360
instead a interesting pattern emerged uh

246
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,440
that indicates that the formation of of

247
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,640
a neg of nation security agenda depends

248
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,080
on how

249
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,279
threats were articulated

250
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,839
and this renders the whole process of

251
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,440
securitization as a speech act

252
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,880
right and the speech x protocol

253
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,760
highlights that secretization is not a

254
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760
natural process of dealing with

255
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,040
natural threats

256
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,160
um and it's not just a simple utterance

257
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,360
or security

258
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,920
and and and it will just become and true

259
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,600
that it will just become a national

260
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,959
security agenda

261
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,399
right it actually makes the whole

262
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,519
security process also involves uh or

263
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,480
sorry the whole securitization process

264
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,320
also involves a element of the audience

265
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,839
the acceptance of the speech by uh by

266
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,959
attempts to speak a security agenda into

267
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,599
existence

268
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,160
so before i go further uh i would like

269
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,920
to show uh here i want to show a short

270
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,640
clip from one of my uh favorite uh

271
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,880
british series uh a very old series

272
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,560
called yes minister

273
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,800
uh or to be more accurate for in this

274
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,120
case it's uh it's from the sequel yes

275
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,399
prime minister

276
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,680
um i highly recommend uh this series for

277
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,839
uh for anyone who actually likes uh

278
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,360
political comedy

279
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,279
right so to set a little bit context

280
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,360
before i play the video um

281
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,200
on the left hand side we have uh

282
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,360
bernard wally uh who is actually the pps

283
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,519
the principal private secretary

284
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,880
uh he was told to do a survey uh about

285
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,880
the british citizens sentiment of

286
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,120
bringing back national service or what

287
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,760
some countries call

288
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,360
military conscription

289
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,240
right the result was citizens were in

290
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,360
favor

291
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,079
right um but then sir humphrey uh the

292
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,800
guy on the right over here um who's

293
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,240
actually the pump sec the permanent

294
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,160
secretary and she told him to redo the

295
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,440
survey

296
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,160
so that the result is negative in state

297
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,160
and berno was just like wait

298
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,760
what are you talking about so

299
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,640
well the party have had an opinion

300
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,160
pogden it seems all the voters are in

301
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,839
favor of bringing back national service

302
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,440
well i have another opinion pearl done

303
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,640
showing the voters are against bringing

304
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,399
back national services

305
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,480
we can't be foreign

306
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,320
have you ever been surveyed asking you

307
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,079
some questions

308
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,760
mr willie

309
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,519
are you worried about the number of

310
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,600
young people without jobs

311
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,720
yes

312
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,720
are you worried about the rise in crime

313
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,200
among teenagers yes do you think there's

314
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,320
a lack of discipline in our

315
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,640
comprehensive schools yes

316
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,959
do you think young people welcome some

317
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,720
authority and leadership in their lives

318
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,320
yes do you think they respond to a

319
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,360
challenge

320
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,720
yes would you be in favor of

321
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,160
reintroducing national services

322
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,639
oh well i suppose i might yes or no

323
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,399
yes mr woolley

324
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,160
are you worried about the danger of war

325
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,160
yes are you worried about the growth of

326
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,760
armaments yes

327
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,200
do you think there's a danger in giving

328
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,399
young people guns and teaching them how

329
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,480
to kill yes do you think it's wrong to

330
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,160
force people to take up arms against

331
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,160
their will yes would you oppose the

332
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,680
reintroduction of

333
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,560
national surveys yes

334
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,120
so as we see here securitization as a

335
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,880
speech act um can really lead a a

336
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,519
security agenda astray if we are

337
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,519
us as as audience uh or even as experts

338
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,320
um

339
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,240
if we are not objective we are not at

340
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,720
all we are not educated enough or if we

341
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,279
are you know if we scarce easy

342
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,240
right we might think um that we know

343
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,800
what we are doing but in fact uh start

344
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,959
working in someone else's

345
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,000
continuous misguided articulation in the

346
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,959
name of um security

347
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,959
well

348
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,760
so in my study of the secretization of

349
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,720
cyberspace i traced back to the 1980s

350
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,680
and particularly in particular the u.s

351
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,560
because

352
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,160
they were one of the most advanced

353
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,560
country in this area back in the days

354
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,680
and i so i observed the the development

355
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,760
of security restricts over time uh quite

356
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,600
interestingly it kind of started with

357
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,480
the movie war games i'm not going to go

358
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,519
too much details on on this today uh for

359
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,680
today's speech um but the whole notion

360
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,680
of cybersecurity really starts to grow

361
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,399
uh from two reports by the national

362
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,000
research council

363
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
right it's a very powerful uh

364
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,760
articulations of all cyber security as

365
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,959
well um it started off saying we are at

366
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,399
risk right

367
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,880
um it then links to the everyday

368
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,839
dependent on computers controlling uh

369
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,880
power delivery communications aviations

370
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,560
and financial services

371
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,839
um you know

372
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,839
computers you know them being used to

373
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,000
store vital information from medical

374
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,040
records to business plans to criminal

375
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,720
records um

376
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,040
that although we trust them they are

377
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,399
vulnerable by them that a modern thief

378
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,480
can steal more with a computer than a

379
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,279
gun

380
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,600
and tomorrow's terrorists may be able to

381
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,240
do more damage with keyboard than with a

382
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,519
bomb

383
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,100
right um

384
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,600
[Music]

385
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,000
and you can just see how

386
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,120
a small short little sentence just

387
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,480
um blew the whole uh consequence uh out

388
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,360
of

389
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,440
proportion very very quickly

390
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,639
uh from computers uh you know

391
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,480
the benefits of it into into into

392
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,680
terrorism and bombs right so first um

393
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,079
fast forward right fast forward um cyber

394
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,040
tres was really uh securitized so so

395
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,560
this this kind of this notion this

396
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,639
articulation was built over time and it

397
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,160
was really really securitized during the

398
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,160
clinton administration uh by leveraging

399
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,480
on the topic of critical infrastructure

400
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,120
um in in under the umbrella of national

401
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,279
security agenda right or in the national

402
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,000
national security agenda as we can see

403
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,800
here until today um the topic of

404
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,320
critical information infrastructure is

405
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,880
still being talked about although

406
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,959
man much progress has been made since

407
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,720
then um

408
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,839
um but

409
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,160
you can see the the

410
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,160
the the longevity of

411
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,040
of of certain san francisco topics um

412
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,120
that still sticks in in national

413
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,639
security agendas for

414
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,720
um the last two or three decades right

415
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,920
so um and in order to preserve such a a

416
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,079
technical subject uh back in the days as

417
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,240
a security problem and you know you have

418
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,160
to think about it in those iran not

419
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,079
everyone understand or truly understand

420
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,120
computers

421
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,360
uh and lots of people are actually uh

422
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,839
scared of computers itself right because

423
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,560
it's such a big mystery and is not a

424
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,399
commodity like today

425
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,000
and and um

426
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,199
and because of that you know cyber

427
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,800
security was identified and actually

428
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,040
discussed as a topic of terrorism and

429
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,480
warfare

430
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,199
um and such threat rhetorics right so

431
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,600
cybersecurity track rhetoric is just

432
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,360
it it's just horrible because it

433
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,800
discount

434
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,959
other areas of national concern

435
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,440
such as what computers can bring

436
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,040
um

437
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,639
the benefits that computers can bring in

438
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,480
terms of economics growth or in terms of

439
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,959
market access law enforcement and the

440
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,399
law enforcement

441
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,279
aspect of cyber security right and this

442
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,000
practice is just horrible

443
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,240
for cyber security as a whole

444
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,800
because when there's cyber security news

445
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,480
it is bad news

446
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,519
people wanted it solved right away um

447
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,759
when cyber security is being

448
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,000
uh discussed right

449
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,160
which is rightly uh which is rightfully

450
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,440
so um

451
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,680
uh for any uh security agendas right

452
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,759
when you identify an enemy you want to

453
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,079
get it you want to get rid of it uh

454
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,120
immediately

455
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,720
uh with whatever possible means

456
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,639
you know just remember you know remember

457
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,880
that that's how a lot of things was was

458
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,199
being done back in the days right

459
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,600
and and we all know that uh that's not

460
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,560
what cyber security is about um you know

461
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,199
uh hence that you know treating cyber

462
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,920
security as a security injection gender

463
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,439
can really hurt the entire industry

464
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,640
but it's really difficult to

465
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,039
disassociate this way of managing

466
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,480
cybersecurity because the word security

467
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,319
is in the name of our field

468
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,640
so a general

469
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,119
school of thoughts is that more security

470
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,319
is better than

471
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,400
unsecurity or more securities better

472
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,240
insecurity right

473
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,600
but security should be uh and must be

474
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,760
discouraged as much as possible

475
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,520
because the excessive right is given to

476
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,440
securitizing uh

477
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,559
you know someone who is actually

478
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,160
secretizing

479
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,360
an issue to act on the security issue of

480
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,799
emerging status and borders a

481
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,440
lesser democratic solution

482
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,160
in essence it symbolizes the failure to

483
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,240
manage issue under normal politics

484
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,400
processes and procedures

485
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,440
right um so although securitization is

486
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,600
is needed uh it's very tempting to

487
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,000
stabil to be used as a stabilizing

488
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,960
factor

489
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,520
uh in certain threatening conflicts uh

490
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,480
or developments uh to nation state

491
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,679
um studies and and lots of cases have uh

492
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,799
have shown that it is undesirable and

493
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,520
counterproductive in most cases and as

494
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,799
we can see

495
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,080
um

496
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,160
when we are tackling issues such as

497
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,440
environmental

498
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,679
issues and as well as market

499
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,640
economy right we can't really securitize

500
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,720
the environment and the whole of the

501
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,000
market

502
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,080
right so on top of all this uh

503
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,840
traditional desire of absolute

504
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,679
protection of the people and the

505
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,440
and the nation state has turned security

506
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,919
into also turns security uh

507
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,480
into a binary concept that you're either

508
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,000
secure

509
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,520
or you're not

510
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,960
um

511
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,520
however and we all know uh that

512
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,360
protecting everything and achieving

513
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,400
absolute security is impossible

514
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,080
especially in uh in this current world

515
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,240
so in contrast to this traditional view

516
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,320
of absolute security

517
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,160
protection of society actually requires

518
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,160
the creation of a

519
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,840
security environment

520
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:19,039
that works with the grain of the society

521
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,600
so if we take cyber security as a

522
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,679
security agenda

523
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,520
the fear of cyberspace as a

524
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,000
vulnerability to nation state

525
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,679
is uh in

526
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,760
just a position to the benefits and

527
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,280
prosperity

528
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,440
information system or technology can

529
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,440
bring to society

530
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,000
right um cyber security requires the

531
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,760
creation of an environment that balance

532
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,400
between security and the market economy

533
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,240
and between state

534
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,280
and societal interests right such a

535
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,840
balancing act can only be achieved

536
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,400
through governance model of risk of risk

537
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,960
management right and the concept of risk

538
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,600
is fundamentally linked to the notion of

539
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,559
uh indefinite security and ongoing

540
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,400
administration of risk

541
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,919
therefore it actually provides a

542
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,799
continual creation and maintenance of a

543
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,679
unsecured or insecure environment

544
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,000
so we actually really need what i really

545
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,159
need is to desecratize

546
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,320
uh cybersecurity

547
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,720
and work on it as a strategy

548
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,679
in which security is solved and produced

549
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,640
so are we already working in cyber

550
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,080
security cyber security uh are we really

551
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,280
studying or practicing cyber security

552
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,360
sure

553
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,840
we are part of the subsequently

554
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,919
strategic discourse

555
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,679
by doing what we do

556
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,760
deep diving into technology

557
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,919
sharing information the know-hows and

558
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,440
working together to protect the global

559
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,799
cyberspace

560
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,679
we are maintaining the cost of the cost

561
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,159
of dissecuritizing cyberspace right so

562
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,520
us as hackers

563
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,120
right we play

564
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,039
a very big role

565
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,080
in cyber safety and cyber security right

566
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,400
we need to continue to deepen our

567
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,240
understanding of cyber security from the

568
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,760
perspective of people process and

569
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,960
technology

570
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,600
and maintain this security or this

571
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,679
strategic discourse

572
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,000
through better cooperation collaboration

573
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,280
and innovation

574
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,400
right and

575
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,840
uh and not always just securitize any

576
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,600
problems when

577
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,720
and issues gets hard to solve right we

578
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,440
are hackers we are innovators we are

579
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,240
problem solvers

580
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,400
so let us all play our part

581
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,120
enjoy uh the rest of the conference uh

582
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,200
learn from your peers and experts here

583
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,480
in root corn

584
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,240
uh let us all secure cyberspace together

585
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,480
thank you
