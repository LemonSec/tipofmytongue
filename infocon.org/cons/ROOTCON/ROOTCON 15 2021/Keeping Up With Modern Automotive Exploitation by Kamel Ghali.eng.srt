00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,640
hello everyone my name is kamel and

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,560
thank you so much for coming to my talk

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,000
keeping up with modern automotive

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,080
exploitation presented at root con 15 in

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,599
2021 today we're going to be talking a

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,920
little bit about some of the more modern

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,400
exploits that have been publicized on

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,400
vehicles in the last few years and kind

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,240
of get a better understanding of how

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,000
vehicles are being targeted in the cyber

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,800
security space in the modern day

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,920
so

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,320
quick introduction to myself i am an

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,238
automotive cyber security architect at

15
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,960
white motion white motion is a lesser

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,559
known company that's actually a

17
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,800
subsidiary of morelli morality is a

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,960
global automotive supplier that's

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,640
originally based in italy but a few

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,440
years back they actually merged with a

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,840
japanese supplier called calsonic kansai

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,239
a rather boring story but long story

23
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,520
short now they're one entity called

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,480
morelli and i work for a automotive

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,920
cybersecurity focused subsidiary wholly

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,719
owned by that corporation as a result

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,280
i'm actually calling in from tokyo today

28
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,519
so konichiwa

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,760
it's a pleasure to meet you

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,400
i'm a trilingual car hacking enthusiast

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,400
on this my short demo

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,880
just showed i am uh decently fluent in

33
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,040
japanese i wouldn't say i'm great at it

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,600
but i also speak english and arabic

35
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,840
i'm an ex-admin of the automotive

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,600
security research group branch in

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,520
detroit michigan where i'm originally

38
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,400
from

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,799
and i am the founder of the asrg branch

40
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,439
in japan unfortunately since moving here

41
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,960
the pandemic has kind of shut things

42
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,560
down so we haven't had a lot of

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,119
opportunities to have a very

44
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,520
how should i say exciting asrg

45
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,200
experience yet but in the future we're

46
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,880
sure to have a lot of cool things to

47
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,799
look out for so if you're interested in

48
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,240
asrg

49
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,399
hit me up and i'll put you in touch

50
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,799
so uh when it comes to automotive i have

51
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,720
a couple of areas of interest i enjoy

52
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,479
doing bluetooth research

53
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,960
research into the usb protocol rf and

54
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,119
some digital forensics and outside of

55
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,040
the laboratory i like to play fighting

56
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,079
games i love cooking and i'm a very poor

57
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,680
ukulele player i haven't actually

58
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,600
practiced in a long time so

59
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,679
unfortunately i won't be able to provide

60
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,400
any solos for anyone anytime soon

61
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,520
so

62
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,080
a quick look at the objectives of this

63
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,959
talk i want to to make this talk to kind

64
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,200
of bring anyone who may not be following

65
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,879
the automotive security industry so

66
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,000
closely into kind of a similar you know

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,319
common frame of reference right so i

68
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,920
want to talk about automotive cyber

69
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,840
security in 2021 and for those of you

70
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,280
who don't know anything at all about

71
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,879
automotive cybersecurity maybe this is

72
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,319
the first time you've ever considered a

73
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,160
car being hacked don't worry i've got a

74
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,879
very brief intro for you as well so

75
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,239
you'll be able to join us for the rest

76
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,840
of the talk

77
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,000
after that kind of intro and catching up

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,920
to the modern state of automotive cyber

79
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,560
security in 2021 i want to go over a

80
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,239
couple of significant

81
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,680
disclosures that have happened in the

82
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,120
last few years namely the texas texas

83
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,280
excuse me the lexus bluetooth hack of

84
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,800
2020 the tesla bluetooth hack of 2020

85
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
the tesla drone hack earlier this year

86
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,959
in 2021 and then i want to kind of look

87
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,440
at what these different

88
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,680
vulnerability or exploitation

89
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,000
publications have in common and how they

90
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,720
all kind of work into this view of the

91
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,760
vehicle as a modern security target

92
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,879
finally we're going to talk a little bit

93
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,040
about how it ties into iot security and

94
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,720
then about product vulnerability

95
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,319
management in the automotive industry

96
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,360
and why

97
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,319
these specific cases highlight its

98
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,400
importance going forward into the

99
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,280
connected transportation future

100
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,080
so

101
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,599
automotive security in 2021 all right

102
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,799
thanks to

103
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,799
chris and charlie uh

104
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,720
charlie miller and chris valasek two of

105
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,959
the most famous car hackers of all time

106
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,560
automotive cyber security has very

107
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,080
steadily become a rising concern for

108
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,000
both governments and industry all over

109
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,200
the world

110
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,200
in 2015 they were actually able to

111
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,080
display or kind of demonstrate

112
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,239
that a jeep cherokee was able to be

113
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,319
hacked from kilometers away without the

114
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,159
hackers ever having

115
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,920
come into physical contact with the

116
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,120
vehicle

117
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,439
of course this was done over a very long

118
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,720
period of time i think it took them

119
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,040
about two years total of research and

120
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,880
reverse engineering of the system but

121
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,358
the end result was they were able to

122
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,199
identify a vehicle through its vin

123
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,759
number and connect to it over the

124
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,800
internet

125
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,680
through the mobile carrier in use in the

126
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,800
vehicle

127
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,320
the the network that they were using

128
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,720
over their cellular modems was able to

129
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,600
be used to log into these vehicles and a

130
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,520
lack of security checks on firmware

131
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,600
flashing i'm simplifying things a little

132
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,160
bit to get through with this but

133
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,320
allowed them to reflash firmware on some

134
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,160
controllers in the vehicle and to take

135
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,120
control this allowed them to kill the

136
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,560
brakes of the car and there's a very

137
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,639
cool video of a poor journalist

138
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,639
experiencing this firsthand

139
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,240
out there on the internet i encourage

140
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,840
all of you to watch

141
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,919
but you know thanks to their their

142
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,840
efforts this industry has become much

143
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,240
more widely understood and there's a lot

144
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,240
more interest and conversation about

145
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,759
automotive security

146
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,400
but

147
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,720
you know six seven years later it's

148
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,400
still kind of the

149
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,560
the poster child for automotive cyber

150
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,160
security research and because it's the

151
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,560
holy grail it's you know long-range

152
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,880
remote takeover of a vehicle to some

153
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,280
extent right so it's the most

154
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,440
archetypal example you could give of a

155
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,479
car hack in the worst case scenario

156
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,479
but that's not what today is about today

157
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,240
is about making sure everyone is aware

158
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,840
of some of the more recent hacks that

159
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,520
have happened on cars

160
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,759
right but anyway so when it comes to

161
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,080
vehicles of course uh it's not just

162
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,120
about information security and privacy

163
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,600
as much as traditional i.t security is

164
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,960
right if you think about my phone

165
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,280
getting hacked or maybe my laptop even

166
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,199
you know worst case scenario

167
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,400
my

168
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,400
my company's network assuming these

169
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,000
aren't connected to any heavy duty

170
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,800
industrial machinery or anything else

171
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,000
that may cause someone physical harm the

172
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,639
the most realistic impact of a hack like

173
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,280
this is generally considered to be loss

174
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,199
of you know wealth it's kind of like

175
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,960
financial damage right for at least for

176
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,560
the for the average person when it comes

177
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,880
to vehicles it's a little bit different

178
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,880
we're talking about a

179
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,160
very large torpedo that kind of cruises

180
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,360
along

181
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,000
you know the street 60 70 miles an hour

182
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,440
or you know about a hundred kilometers

183
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,919
an hour and if this

184
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,199
you know thing this large two-ton

185
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,840
tonk of steel carrying people inside it

186
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,319
is ever compromised or interfered with

187
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,800
in a way such that an accident is more

188
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,360
likely or intentionally caused you have

189
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,560
a situation where public safety is now

190
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,639
a concern for automotive cyber security

191
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,639
so the stakes are a little bit higher

192
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,160
and that has actually gotten the

193
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,080
attention of governments and

194
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,840
standardization bodies all over the

195
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,120
world

196
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,199
so among these you have the united

197
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,520
nations and you have the

198
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,280
society of automotive engineers and the

199
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,520
international standards association

200
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,280
these bodies of course the united

201
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,639
nations i'm sure you've heard of them

202
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,880
before they provide you know guidance to

203
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,080
different nations and come up with

204
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,440
regulations

205
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,240
and

206
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,160
you know most mostly non-binding

207
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,120
legislation to help countries

208
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,919
more or less operate properly and this

209
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,240
applies as well to technology so the

210
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,080
ece wp29 is a document that was actually

211
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,280
published by the united nations in 2020

212
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,759
detailing some of their recommendations

213
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,800
for cyber security best practices and

214
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,680
essentially encouraging countries to

215
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,400
write into their own law

216
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,840
laws that mandate automotive

217
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,759
manufacturers to

218
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,039
undergo

219
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,599
cyber security tests for their vehicles

220
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,919
and make sure that these vehicles are

221
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,319
cyber secure to the extent possible

222
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,560
before they're allowed to be released

223
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,840
onto the street similarly the iso sae

224
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,639
21434 standard was actually released or

225
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,879
i guess finalized very recently the

226
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,120
draft has been in the works for several

227
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,000
years now but this document is more of a

228
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,599
technical guide that serves as a

229
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,759
a complementary document to the united

230
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,520
nations regulation

231
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,280
in which you know experts from the

232
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,199
industry have come together and provided

233
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,360
a list of best practices for how to

234
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,680
actually perform these cybersecurity

235
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,599
tests and checks for vehicles to ensure

236
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,280
that they're as secure as possible

237
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,799
before being released into the market

238
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,279
these are of course very lengthy

239
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,880
documents and could probably take up

240
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,159
their own talk but just the fact that

241
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,320
they exist is evidence that governments

242
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,159
and standardizing bodies alike are

243
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,839
putting a high priority on automotive

244
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,600
cyber security for the future of

245
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,920
connected transportation uh and then of

246
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,080
course uh one last thing i want a couple

247
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,240
last things to mention is that because

248
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,880
the industry is still relatively new and

249
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,959
not that mainstream especially when it

250
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,480
comes to

251
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,480
cyber security as a kind of a much

252
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,200
broader you know field of study there's

253
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,920
a severe lack of professionals and so if

254
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,600
you've ever been thinking man i wish i

255
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,080
had a job that you know i had a little

256
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,760
bit more of a niche in right if you're

257
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,880
an i.t

258
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,800
or traditional cyber security engineer

259
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,399
and you're thinking of specializing in a

260
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,240
field where you could really stand out i

261
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,680
highly recommend you to check out

262
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,839
automotive there's a lot of

263
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,760
fun in car hacking and there are a lot

264
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,680
of great resources to help you get

265
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,959
started if you're interested but

266
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,399
leave that for later and then finally

267
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,000
the massive supply chain this is

268
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,760
something you can't really escape when

269
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,600
it comes to talking about automotive

270
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,320
security right when you consider

271
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,600
for any of you familiar with the

272
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,440
automotive industry

273
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,480
just how many different companies have a

274
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,560
hand in deciding what goes into a

275
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,959
vehicle the prospect of making sure that

276
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,640
all of these companies based in

277
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,120
different countries with different laws

278
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,279
different regulations different

279
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,760
standards of practice different

280
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,320
budgets or even safety

281
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,560
protocols coming together it's very

282
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,720
daunting right because you have the oem

283
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,720
who at the end of the day sells the car

284
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,800
puts their logo their stamp on it and

285
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,399
they're the brand that you know right

286
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,160
most people in the world would know a

287
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,240
brand like ford or tesla but then you

288
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,720
have the tier ones who provide a lot of

289
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,440
the

290
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,839
modules to these oems right you might

291
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,839
know some of the bigger companies if you

292
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,440
you've ever been exposed to the industry

293
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,160
right continental denso etc but your

294
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,440
average everyday person doesn't know

295
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,160
that these companies exist right so they

296
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,839
may not have the awareness of how

297
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,320
daunting of a task it is to really

298
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,480
propagate cyber security best practices

299
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,640
throughout such a huge supply chain and

300
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,320
then of course it goes farther down into

301
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,240
tier two suppliers uh so on and so forth

302
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,519
but

303
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,680
that being said you know these oems and

304
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,760
tier ones the entire automotive industry

305
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,360
they're still doing their best to

306
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,680
incorporate cyber security into their

307
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,519
development processes right the

308
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,600
automotive industry is not a very

309
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,560
fast-moving young type of industry it's

310
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,160
pretty well established you know cars

311
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,360
have been around for a long time the

312
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,399
automakers have gotten pretty good at

313
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,160
doing what they do

314
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,920
and so they've kind of settled into

315
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,079
their ways for better or for worse right

316
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,160
they have a process they have a system

317
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,160
and it takes time to add changes to this

318
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,880
system right it's a very mature industry

319
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,720
you can't just introduce something like

320
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,200
a cyber security regulation or a bunch

321
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,800
of standards and expect them to be

322
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
applied to the whole industry overnight

323
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,959
it's just not realistic

324
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:31,760
so

325
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,000
this fact of the matter is that well

326
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,839
okay now the united nations has put out

327
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,839
this this regulation a lot of the

328
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:38,880
governments around the world are

329
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,560
starting to pick it up

330
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,120
the oems and the the manufacturers and

331
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,959
suppliers within the countries that are

332
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,800
applying this you know this new legal

333
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,240
structure they're doing their best to

334
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,240
catch up and try and incorporate these

335
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,000
into their their processes for

336
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,920
development but it is taking time and

337
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,519
it's still definitely going to be a

338
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,000
trial and error as we go into the future

339
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,360
of actual usage and implementation

340
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,440
of these standards but there's a lot of

341
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,720
industry groups encouraging

342
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,480
collaboration that i want to kind of

343
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,160
mention i mentioned the automotive

344
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,000
security research group briefly before

345
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,320
in my own introduction asrg is a group

346
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,959
that promotes open access to information

347
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,279
about the automotive cyber security

348
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,360
industry we have branches all over the

349
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,360
world it's completely free to join i'm

350
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,440
not doing any you know sponsorship based

351
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,200
plugging here but i highly recommend you

352
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,680
check out asrg if you're a

353
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,440
a hobbyist who's interested in learning

354
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,200
about car hacking and just kind of

355
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,040
getting into the industry

356
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,639
through direct contact with

357
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,519
professionals asrg is great for that

358
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,519
on the more

359
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,440
how should i say

360
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,120
corporate business side of things you

361
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,320
have the auto isac and j auto isaac so

362
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,160
the isac is of course an information

363
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,279
sharing

364
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,480
community based around the oems and tier

365
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,000
ones the actual

366
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,480
players of the industry who make the

367
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,560
vehicles that actually go onto the road

368
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,959
they have this community where which

369
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,800
they're able to share information about

370
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,680
vulnerabilities etc with one another

371
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,200
updated vulnerability information

372
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,120
training setting standards regulations

373
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,880
they have some ties to the government

374
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,959
that allows them to kind of

375
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,519
be on top of different regulations uh

376
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,079
and legislation before it actually hits

377
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,600
the books per se

378
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,079
which makes it uh very convenient for

379
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,680
people working in the industry but those

380
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,680
are not quite as accessible for for

381
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,680
outsiders right in the sense that you

382
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,519
don't already work at one of these

383
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,200
companies and then the j auto isaac is

384
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,040
just the japanese version of the auto

385
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,519
isaac so following the same model but

386
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,120
mainly attended to

387
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,639
uh by japanese companies so

388
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,320
i'm done with the boring stuff we can

389
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,560
actually get into some case studies now

390
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,199
and before excuse me before we get

391
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,480
started i want to make a quick

392
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,680
disclaimer

393
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,160
while i'm not directly related to these

394
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,360
uh pieces of research i'm a huge fan of

395
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,920
the work i always try to give you know

396
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,279
as much credit to the original

397
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,120
researchers as possible

398
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,240
but i believe that there's a lot of

399
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,240
value in being able to share this

400
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,600
information and the fact that this

401
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,519
research is going on with a broader

402
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,560
audience

403
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,519
of course uh i i do my own automotive

404
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,279
research as well but because my employer

405
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,120
is usually the sponsor for said research

406
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,600
i have the nda problem prevents people

407
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,519
talking about my own work most of the

408
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,839
time especially in japan they're very

409
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,440
touchy about confidentiality when it

410
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,600
comes to cyber security work um so

411
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,519
please forgive me if it feels like i'm

412
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,160
just a content vulture as it were but

413
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,600
we're going to talk about one of my

414
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,560
favorite ones from the recent future

415
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,519
the

416
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,399
lexus bluetooth hack of march 2020. so

417
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,360
this

418
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,959
hack

419
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,120
it affected

420
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,600
several lexus brand vehicles that were

421
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,240
manufactured outside of japan between

422
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,680
2016 and i believe

423
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,560
2019.

424
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,320
this particular disclosure kicked up

425
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,000
quite a bit of a storm in the japanese

426
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,839
community

427
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,320
especially because toyota is seen as the

428
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,160
big dog in the japanese automotive

429
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,240
industry right so if anything happens to

430
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,320
toyota all the other smaller oems are

431
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,680
kind of you know pay very close

432
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,519
attention like what happened like

433
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,120
is it okay like do we have the same

434
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,800
problems do we have to to worry about

435
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,480
this right so this one was actually uh

436
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,720
very very prominent when it came out uh

437
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,440
here in the japanese industry

438
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,320
so keen labs uh i believe they're

439
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,480
they're owned by cent in china

440
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,880
they showed that through a

441
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,880
vulnerability in the vehicle's bluetooth

442
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,360
stack they were able to execute commands

443
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,199
without having to be paired with the

444
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,800
vehicle

445
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,560
essentially remote code execution

446
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,320
through bluetooth but they didn't

447
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,199
actually reveal what vulnerabilities led

448
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,880
to this rce in their initial paper

449
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,480
some

450
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,480
vulnerability reporting websites

451
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,720
reported it as blueborne for those of

452
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,240
you who may not be familiar with

453
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,120
blueborne it's a very high profile suite

454
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,720
of

455
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,199
remote code execution vulnerabilities

456
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,759
that was released by armist labs in i

457
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,759
believe 2017.

458
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,800
so

459
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,399
that kind of lines up with the timeline

460
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,920
you know it's very possible that this

461
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,079
was the vulnerability that keen labs was

462
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,320
able to exploit in these vehicles seeing

463
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,880
as the start date for manufacturer

464
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,880
vehicles with this particular head unit

465
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,480
or infotainment system in them uh were

466
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,880
were initially created starting in 2016.

467
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,920
so but i i don't know if there's a an

468
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,639
official i guess identification for the

469
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,240
specific vulnerability they use but

470
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,839
there it should be maybe more

471
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,920
information online as they didn't want

472
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,600
to reveal too much information at the

473
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,759
initial disclosure of this research of

474
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,120
course for

475
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,079
security purposes and you know to

476
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,639
keep things confidential

477
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,680
but

478
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,040
anyway

479
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,839
because bluetooth was being run with

480
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,399
root user privileges the researchers

481
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,240
were able to send instructions to

482
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,880
construct a wi-fi based back door that

483
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,720
would automatically grant them a root

484
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,720
shell they were essentially able to

485
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,799
install a back door into the

486
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,880
vehicle's infotainment system over

487
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,720
bluetooth but

488
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,000
thanks to the fact that they were able

489
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,199
to pivot to the wi-fi protocol instead

490
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,799
they were actually able to enhance the

491
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,400
range at which this technique was usable

492
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,599
so while wi-fi itself wasn't exactly

493
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,520
you know the target of attack initially

494
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,280
they were able to use the wi-fi network

495
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,200
as a pivoting tool to expand access to

496
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,480
their

497
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,400
their their attack target right because

498
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,760
obviously wi-fi

499
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,640
has a rather a slightly longer range

500
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,200
than bluetooth they're both considered

501
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,559
pretty short-range communication

502
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,760
technologies

503
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,480
but wi-fi definitely has its benefits

504
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,280
when compared to bluetooth but so they

505
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,520
they chose to instead of continuing on

506
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,240
the bluetooth remote code execution

507
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,960
go for the root shell option over wi-fi

508
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,320
instead

509
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,160
and so from here the researchers were

510
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,240
able to abuse the linux board's

511
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,919
administrative position within the

512
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,840
in-vehicle infotainment system to

513
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,039
reflash the firmware on a secondary ecu

514
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,000
now

515
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
there's one device the in-vehicle

516
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,799
infotainment system inside this car

517
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,720
but it has multiple boards inside and

518
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,400
multiple different pcbs each of which

519
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,080
have a couple of you know computers

520
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,360
inside

521
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,799
and they have different privileges and

522
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,520
different roles that they play inside

523
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,039
this device right the ivi is the

524
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,360
infotainment unit it's usually what you

525
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,120
would see like a little screen on inside

526
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,559
the vehicle you can

527
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,520
connect your phone over bluetooth or

528
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,360
set up a wi-fi hotspot you know the

529
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,440
modern vehicles have all sorts of cool

530
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,520
gadgets built into their ivis these days

531
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,200
some of them even have games i think you

532
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,600
can download apps from app stores

533
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,799
but

534
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,559
the point is among these different

535
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,600
boards inside the ivi one of them was

536
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,360
technically the administrative board and

537
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,720
that's the board they were able to get

538
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,200
that remote code execution on so because

539
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,640
of this board's privilege in the ivi's

540
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,080
environment

541
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,640
it actually was in the position where

542
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,360
it's allowed to push updates to the

543
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,320
other

544
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,840
computers inside the ipi right so this

545
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,640
board was kind of the boss of the ivi

546
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,400
system and from there they were able to

547
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,960
reflash other processors and take

548
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,679
advantage of this unit they've actually

549
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,919
compromised right this is an issue where

550
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,240
there's a lack of

551
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,919
checking and making sure that any

552
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,320
firmware updates being sent to different

553
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,240
parts of the vehicle are properly signed

554
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,559
using you know signatures that can be

555
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,640
verified cryptographic signatures to

556
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,440
ensure that unauthorized firmware isn't

557
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,280
being written to your devices inside

558
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,400
your car

559
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,600
so

560
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,000
the secondary ecu that they targeted was

561
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,679
responsible for the interaction with the

562
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,440
vehicle's can buses

563
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,200
for those of you with no car hacking

564
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,000
experience can bus is control area

565
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,480
network it's a in-vehicle network for

566
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,720
all intents and purposes one of the most

567
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,080
common ones in the whole world

568
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,400
essentially these are specific networks

569
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,080
that are designed to allow different

570
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,400
controllers inside a vehicle to

571
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,159
communicate with one another over short

572
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,840
distances

573
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,799
but

574
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,360
the can device they had compromised and

575
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,760
reflashed originally had some filters on

576
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,559
it right they were not allowed to send

577
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,240
arbitrary ken messages it was kind of

578
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,640
restricted to a certain subset of

579
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,559
functionality specific to that

580
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,720
operational environment for for the

581
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,039
usual operation of the vehicle

582
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,240
but remember

583
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,919
they have the ability to change the

584
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,559
software so they were actually able to

585
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,240
disable those can filters and unlock

586
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,840
arbitrary can most camos excuse me can

587
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,159
bus message access through their

588
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,440
foothold on that authoritative board in

589
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,679
the iei

590
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,679
so of course once again this comes back

591
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,760
to the lack of firmware signature

592
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,240
checking on the secondary board and had

593
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,400
such a measure been in place even with

594
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
the remote code execution on the main

595
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,200
linux board there may have been

596
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,039
you know no opportunity for the

597
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,360
researchers to pivot to the in-vehicle

598
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,440
network which gives them access to a

599
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,240
much

600
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,880
broader range of controllers inside the

601
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,159
vehicle

602
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,559
of course separation of your you know

603
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,480
networks and sandboxing of course all

604
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,919
come into play here these are all

605
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,679
security principles that are very

606
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,799
relevant in automotive too right

607
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:25,840
so

608
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,840
following this rewriting of the vehicles

609
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,440
firmware the researchers were able to

610
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,280
send arbitrary can data including

611
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,240
diagnostic requests this in theory could

612
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,480
lead to even further exploitation of the

613
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,679
vehicle

614
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,919
as through diagnostics you can actually

615
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,720
reprogram other controllers in the car

616
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,480
they would of course have to re first

617
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,360
engineer the diagnostic protocol used to

618
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,520
flash these vehicles

619
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,440
the diagnostic protocols also use

620
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,200
something called a

621
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,679
security access mechanism when it comes

622
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,679
to programming as well

623
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,080
and so this may have taken more time but

624
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,280
it essentially is just showing that

625
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,240
there is an open-ended door for further

626
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,640
post-ex post exploitation

627
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,600
activities on this target

628
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,600
but you know of course that rabbit hole

629
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,120
is an entirely different conversation

630
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,960
and it's mostly theoretical

631
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,159
but the full technical details uh

632
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:19,440
are probably going to be a lot more

633
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,799
interesting for those of you who want to

634
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,840
read 10 cent did release a blog post

635
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,559
detailing in much more detail how they

636
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,280
did all of these a brilliant

637
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,640
should i say

638
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,320
all this brilliant research

639
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,520
right

640
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,360
so

641
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,720
the next case study is on some research

642
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,600
that was performed on tesla vehicles uh

643
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,600
and this was actually disclosed also in

644
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,480
2020 but more closer to the end of the

645
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,520
year

646
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,039
this one was actually done by a

647
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,880
gentleman named leonard reuters i

648
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,440
believe he he gave a talk about this

649
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,520
uh exact piece of research

650
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,640
in the 2021 defcon car hiking village so

651
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,159
if you want to hear him talk about this

652
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,919
i highly recommend you go and listen to

653
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,919
him he'll have some more details that i

654
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,880
wouldn't be able to share with you

655
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,960
but the

656
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,400
gentleman who

657
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,080
did this you know of course i'm so sorry

658
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,840
for my pronunciation if i pronounce his

659
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,480
name wrong but leonard wuters from

660
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,480
belgium he he showed that the

661
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,799
bluetooth-based firmware update process

662
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,120
used using tesla model x key fobs could

663
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,600
be abused to eventually lead to theft of

664
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,039
the vehicle

665
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,600
right teslas are generally seen as the

666
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,200
most

667
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,280
how should i say high-tech

668
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,360
state-of-the-art vehicles in the world

669
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,280
right now right a lot of people have

670
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,840
this impression that the tesla is the

671
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,000
the car of tomorrow right it is the the

672
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,679
all the bells and whistles possible on a

673
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,360
vehicle and to some extent that's very

674
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,240
true

675
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,919
but that also means it's kind of a sneak

676
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,320
peek into what the

677
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,919
security landscape for a vehicle is

678
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,600
going to look like

679
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,520
so when something happens to tesla

680
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,480
you better pay attention

681
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,039
excuse me

682
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,799
routers found that the

683
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,159
model x key fob responds to a signal

684
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,240
emitted by the vehicle's pcm which can

685
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,400
then lead to a reprogramming session

686
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,240
done by bluetooth right so bluetooth

687
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,480
traditionally in vehicles

688
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,320
has been used for things like

689
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,200
media control hands-free phone calls

690
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,279
sharing contacts with your vehicle there

691
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,120
hasn't really been a lot of cases of

692
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,640
bluetooth being used for anything

693
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,799
remotely safety critical

694
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,960
and in this case we're seeing that tesla

695
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,559
has decided to take this bluetooth

696
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,679
technology

697
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,360
and use it for something a little bit

698
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,279
more important right they're using it as

699
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,600
the actual

700
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,840
conduit by which they push software

701
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,000
updates or firmware updates

702
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,080
to their key fobs right it's kind of a

703
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,440
big deal right you're changing the

704
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,600
software on the key to your car

705
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,760
over bluetooth and bluetooth research is

706
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,159
something i i may have mentioned before

707
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,320
i have a passing interest in

708
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,760
there's a lot of really great bluetooth

709
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,520
research coming out in the last few

710
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,279
years but i don't want to go too far too

711
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,679
far into that but the point is right

712
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,600
this kind of

713
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,559
novel

714
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,158
application of bluetooth and automotive

715
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,240
is what led to this attack being

716
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,480
discovered so

717
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,400
the only authentication needed from the

718
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,360
bcm was derived from the vehicle's vin

719
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,600
the vehicle identification number the

720
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,279
vehicle identification number isn't

721
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,760
usually considered secret information

722
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,360
you can actually get this information

723
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,279
from any car you see by just kind of

724
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,720
peeking through the windshield right if

725
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,760
you take a look through the top it's

726
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,760
usually kind of

727
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,640
written

728
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,240
along the side

729
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,400
on the top of the dashboard so it's not

730
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,400
considered highly confidential

731
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,159
information by any stretch of the

732
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,840
imagination so

733
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,039
since there was no code signing checks

734
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,720
done on the firmware updates pushed to

735
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,480
the key fob

736
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,080
rewriting the firmware to share an

737
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,840
unlock code with the attacker's device

738
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,080
is actually pretty easy once this was

739
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,799
done a disassembled model x key fob

740
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,640
could then be used to transmit the said

741
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,039
signal to unlock the vehicle

742
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,520
so essentially what leonard and his and

743
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,159
his team did they actually got a tesla

744
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,840
bcm you know off of ebay or something

745
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,600
and messed around with it reprogrammed

746
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,559
it

747
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,240
and

748
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,360
used it

749
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,640
to request an unlock signal

750
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,480
from a key fob

751
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,840
so basically they tricked the bcm into

752
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,960
thinking

753
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,720
it belonged to the car

754
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,240
that the key fob the target key fob

755
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,400
belonged to so they could then request

756
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,559
for credentials to open the vehicle and

757
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,039
get inside

758
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,120
but you know at the end of the day this

759
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,960
particular vulnerability only granted

760
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,440
them access to the inside of the vehicle

761
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,559
from here

762
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,840
now you have physical access of the

763
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,880
vehicle

764
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,520
you have a rather broad attack surface

765
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,520
now right you can actually plug into the

766
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,440
in-vehicle networks now because because

767
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,640
of course these are very these are

768
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,640
physical networks so

769
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,039
you have access to much more targets for

770
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,520
post-exploitation and pivoting

771
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,720
so

772
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,440
through a port located under the model x

773
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,840
display more damage can be done through

774
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,520
the can bus right can bus coming back

775
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,159
again once once more from from the last

776
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,159
case study we went through

777
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,880
so can bus access to the bcm

778
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,039
meant that they were able to use a

779
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,480
different vulnerability

780
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,200
to actually pair the bcm the body

781
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,240
control module that was inside the car

782
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,520
to their new fake tesla key right that

783
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,600
third part that third tesla key

784
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,360
the third party tesla key that they used

785
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,440
to actually send the unlock signal

786
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,840
is now being reintroduced to this car

787
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,520
saying like hey look i'm your new key

788
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,440
you should recognize me and let me start

789
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,159
the car and this is actually exactly

790
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,559
what they did so they tricked the car

791
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,799
into thinking that the new key fob is

792
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,039
the original key fob

793
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,799
or something along those lines and we're

794
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,960
able to unlock all driving functionality

795
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,120
for the car essentially allowing them to

796
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,799
steal it

797
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,799
interestingly all of this the whole

798
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,200
process only takes about

799
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,520
i'd say about 15 minutes and everything

800
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,440
that you needed to be able to perform

801
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,039
this attack would cost you under 400

802
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:11,840
right

803
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,000
you could actually all fit it inside a a

804
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,960
lunchbox sized you know

805
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,799
backpack really you can put it inside a

806
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,880
backpack sneak up behind a family who

807
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,120
parked their tesla and maybe went for a

808
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,200
walk or go get some ice cream all you

809
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,880
needed to do is just follow them until

810
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,399
you get that unlocked signal then go

811
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,080
back to the car and do everything else

812
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,559
manually and well congratulations you

813
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:33,440
are now

814
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,880
the new owner of a stolen tesla model x

815
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,399
right so

816
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,000
there's a very practical attack from the

817
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,360
perspective of a motivation

818
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,039
perspective right because when it comes

819
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,640
to cyber security a lot of the reason

820
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,880
that car hacks aren't very widespread

821
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,399
yet is because

822
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,600
the

823
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,159
motivation to effort ratio

824
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,640
is is is very low right there's not a

825
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,279
lot of criminal benefit criminals aren't

826
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,120
interested in killing random people and

827
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,640
causing havoc on the road they're more

828
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,799
interested in stealing things they want

829
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,960
actual financial

830
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,720
return for their efforts and that's why

831
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,720
ransomware has become so

832
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,480
prevalent over the last few years

833
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,799
but this is actually a scenario where

834
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,960
you're using a very high tech method to

835
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,200
be able to steal a car now whether or

836
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,640
not this was ever used in such a

837
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,559
malicious manner is

838
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,799
something only god knows but the fact

839
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:28,000
that this exists is is you know very

840
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,440
concerning

841
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,520
so but interestingly enough

842
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,320
the model x key fobs do actually contain

843
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,039
unique cryptographic certificates that

844
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,760
should have prevented this reprogramming

845
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,799
of the bcm to accept the new key

846
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,880
as its as its key

847
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,320
however

848
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,080
the bcm

849
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,320
never actually implements this

850
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,679
certificate check

851
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:52,640
so

852
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,640
the certificate is there but the bcm is

853
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,640
just not checking it it's like they had

854
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,640
everything in place to be able to avoid

855
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,679
the same mistake that the alexis fellows

856
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,600
we talked about a second ago made

857
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,360
unfortunately they did miss the last

858
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,880
step

859
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,720
and

860
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,240
well that's why we're talking about them

861
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,399
today so but at this stage the attacker

862
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,480
now has the model x and can drive away

863
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,360
with it

864
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,240
and

865
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,120
you know

866
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,720
whoever comes back is going to be very

867
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,799
sad to see that their cars disappeared

868
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,880
without a trace

869
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,000
so

870
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,520
hopefully this case study illustrates

871
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,120
the importance of assuring that every

872
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,960
layer of system security is properly

873
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,159
configured

874
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:31,600
while the bluetooth implementation

875
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,200
itself wasn't

876
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,679
faulty this time per se as it was in the

877
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,760
last one right in the last example we

878
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,559
gave

879
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,799
the actual bluetooth stack itself had a

880
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,559
vulnerability resulting in remote code

881
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,240
execution

882
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,240
in this example the bluetooth stack

883
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,440
itself

884
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,760
more or less just fine they were able to

885
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,840
they didn't actually

886
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,520
how should i say

887
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,360
compromise the vehicle through the

888
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,279
bluetooth stack itself they used the

889
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,120
processes on either end of the bluetooth

890
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,320
stack

891
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,240
to actually make that happen

892
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,480
right

893
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,840
excuse me and then once again of course

894
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,360
code signing and making sure that you

895
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,279
have certificates ensuring that any

896
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,720
firmware being pushed to any part of

897
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,440
your vehicle is from the oem or another

898
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,720
approved source

899
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,360
is is rather important

900
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,320
so the last

901
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,640
where'd my car go i could have sworn i

902
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,880
had a car on the slide a second ago but

903
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,480
the last case study we're going to be

904
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,919
looking at today

905
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,279
is the

906
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,320
uh tesla drone hack or cutely dubbed

907
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,200
t-bone that was revealed earlier in 2021

908
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,320
this year

909
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,360
so this hack was done by some fellows

910
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,200
named ralph philip weinmann and benedict

911
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
jumps

912
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,320
i if i said that wrong i'm very sorry uh

913
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,559
of course once again my

914
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,120
pronunciation might be off but these

915
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,080
guys did a great uh bit of research here

916
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,760
and showed that

917
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,679
bluetooth isn't the only potentially

918
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,000
vulnerable network in a vehicle today

919
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,919
there's a lot more that can be looked at

920
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,039
so

921
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,039
this hack took advantage of a library

922
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,360
with a vulnerability that was accessible

923
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,120
over wi-fi as opposed to bluetooth

924
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,279
normally wi-fi wouldn't be accessible to

925
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,880
someone that's not connected to that

926
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,360
access point uh

927
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,679
in this you know on the same subnet more

928
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,240
or less uh as the actual vehicle itself

929
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,000
so it's a little bit harder to make use

930
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,399
of this kind of vulnerability you know

931
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,880
on a car you've just encountered but

932
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,519
tesla's have this very weird quirk about

933
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,240
them at least in europe where all teslas

934
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,120
will

935
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,279
automatically connect to a default

936
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,919
service ssid for any of you who've done

937
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,159
wi-fi testing before

938
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,559
and this ssid is called tesla service

939
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,240
wouldn't you know they're actually able

940
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,760
to find out

941
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,960
the the password in use for this ssid as

942
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,760
well

943
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,519
and through that they were able to

944
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,320
successfully create a fake access point

945
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,159
that this tesla vehicle would then

946
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:02,240
connect to

947
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,120
now

948
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,200
that alone isn't really

949
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,880
you know the end of the world right okay

950
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,320
you got the car to connect to your fake

951
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,720
access point you know that's awesome

952
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,919
but

953
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,240
what did they do next so the vulnerable

954
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,320
software in question

955
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,799
is called con man as i you can maybe see

956
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,279
up there on the slide i have the actual

957
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,679
cds that they were awarded

958
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:28,320
for this research 20 21 266 75 and 266

959
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,919
76

960
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:31,679
each of them giving that each of these

961
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,880
vulnerabilities giving them a different

962
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,240
level of

963
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,120
control over this vehicle and what it's

964
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,559
doing

965
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,960
so con man is a

966
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,720
commonly used you know iot

967
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,240
handler for dns and dhcp for any kind of

968
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,480
network devices device this is very

969
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,720
common in the iot world a lot of you

970
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,799
know smaller cheaper

971
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,799
iot devices that connect to wi-fi will

972
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,600
use con man for help with the dns and

973
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,440
dhcp

974
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,519
the version of con man that the vehicle

975
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,879
was using at the time was version 1.37

976
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,280
this was at the time the most up-to-date

977
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,918
version with no known vulnerabilities in

978
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,440
it actually since conman 1.34

979
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,960
had been pretty stable and there wasn't

980
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,520
a lot of security research done showing

981
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,440
that there was anything especially wrong

982
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,599
with it but the researchers decided to

983
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,239
fuzz it anyway given that some of the

984
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,199
handling of dns seemed suspicious to

985
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,639
them is more or less how they phrase it

986
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,079
in their paper which i have linked at

987
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,599
the end of the

988
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:36,800
talk

989
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,280
but they targeted the dns parsing

990
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,399
section and found a couple of bugs and

991
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:43,520
of course

992
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,399
after

993
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,879
expanding on these bugs with a i believe

994
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,800
it's a special emulator that they

995
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,560
themselves made

996
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,000
they found the area that caused the

997
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,399
program to crash and identified a

998
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,639
function that calls a mem copy command

999
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,880
without proper input validation leading

1000
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,880
to the possibility of a stack overflow

1001
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,640
attack being the brilliant you know

1002
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,200
post-exploitation kind of

1003
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,960
guys that they are the researchers were

1004
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,320
then able to use a separate

1005
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,599
vulnerability also listed here to gain

1006
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,920
more information about the stack right

1007
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,000
leaking information that allowed them to

1008
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,720
put together a payload to give them more

1009
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,640
access to this vehicle right allowing

1010
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,839
them to bypass security measures such as

1011
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,160
data execution prevention and address

1012
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,400
space layout randomization

1013
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,160
i see the aslr

1014
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,359
and the dep these are common techniques

1015
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,040
used to prevent

1016
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,400
hackers from

1017
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,720
getting execution you know on your stack

1018
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,640
but thanks to this other vulnerability

1019
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,560
that was leaking information

1020
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,079
to the researchers they were actually

1021
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,960
able to bypass those preventative

1022
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,400
measures that were in place

1023
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,079
interestingly enough they actually

1024
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,280
initially came up with these

1025
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,280
vulnerabilities hoping to use them in a

1026
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,400
pwn to own contest that has featured

1027
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,240
vehicles in recent years where if you

1028
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,280
actually

1029
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,800
hack you know root the tesla you

1030
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,560
actually get to keep the tesla i believe

1031
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,760
it's held in canada every year

1032
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,480
unfortunately the con the convention or

1033
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,000
rather the car hacking portion of this

1034
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,280
event was cancelled due to the

1035
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,880
coronavirus

1036
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,960
and that's why it was revealed

1037
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,440
last year instead to to a conference

1038
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,560
called apsec west i want to say but

1039
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,400
once they got their foothold sorry i got

1040
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,560
kind of sidetracked they utilized some

1041
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,960
other redacted techniques that they

1042
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,960
declined to include in the paper for

1043
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,640
sensitivity regions

1044
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,040
to escalate their privileges to root on

1045
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,880
the tesla giving them full control over

1046
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,280
the tesla's infotainment system

1047
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,960
from here they could invoke any action

1048
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,560
possible through that infotainment

1049
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,920
system any of you who have ever been in

1050
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,440
a tesla

1051
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,280
the infotainment system is like

1052
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,800
this big and it's got this you know

1053
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,640
beautiful screen and it's like you got

1054
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,000
your map you got your music and

1055
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,520
everything especially in the model x

1056
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,240
it's really quite something you can

1057
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,079
control your your seat temperature you

1058
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,440
can control the cabin temperature the

1059
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,119
air conditioner you can open and close

1060
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,359
doors they could do anything possible

1061
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,839
from that ivi remotely without even

1062
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,000
being inside the vehicle including like

1063
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,680
changing the music and stuff

1064
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,560
so

1065
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,800
they called this the drone hack because

1066
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,720
everything needed to perform this hack

1067
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,359
could potentially be loaded onto a drone

1068
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,520
and this is significant because

1069
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,920
well tesla's all around the world have

1070
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,440
this little quirk about them right they

1071
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,240
have to charge so you could essentially

1072
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,920
the idea was you know you could take a

1073
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,920
drone with all of this software on it

1074
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,359
and kind of park it behind a

1075
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,680
supercharger and just kind of wait for

1076
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,839
unsuspecting tesla owners to come park

1077
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,839
their car go do some grocery shopping

1078
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,079
while it charges and come back to find

1079
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,640
that oh someone opened my car and either

1080
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,960
stole all my stuff or as leonard did in

1081
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,560
the previous example use some other

1082
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,720
vulnerabilities to give them the ability

1083
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,200
to drive the car away there's any number

1084
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,640
of possibilities from there once you've

1085
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,240
gotten access to that infotainment

1086
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,280
system

1087
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,320
letting you open the door

1088
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,960
it's a very you know flexible and fun

1089
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,200
attack platform you know a drone and

1090
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,800
they actually did show a proof of

1091
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,760
concept in their original

1092
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,920
release of this research that shows them

1093
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,599
doing exactly that

1094
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,200
right so very very very good work uh by

1095
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,079
uh ralph and benedict i'm a huge fan

1096
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,680
honestly

1097
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,880
so

1098
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,640
taking a quick look back at the three

1099
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,800
case studies we went over

1100
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,640
they have a couple things in common

1101
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,800
right all of them were

1102
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,960
essentially compromised through the use

1103
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,040
of close range wireless technologies

1104
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,359
either bluetooth or wi-fi in the lexus

1105
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,119
example both of these technologies were

1106
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,880
actually used one is the initial entry

1107
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,520
point and another to extend the range by

1108
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,520
which they could you know proceed to

1109
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,359
poke at the vehicle

1110
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:44,960
in all these cases

1111
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,440
a lack of signature checks

1112
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,359
or at least in the first two cases a

1113
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,359
lack of signature checks allowed the

1114
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,079
attackers to reflash software on these

1115
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,880
devices without approval from the oem

1116
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,720
leading them to be able to remove

1117
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,400
filters on the canvas in the first

1118
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,920
example

1119
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,000
or just simply

1120
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,720
tell the the bcm in the car to recognize

1121
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,599
my new key fob in the second example

1122
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,240
right both of these vulnerabilities that

1123
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,800
were used both excuse me all of the

1124
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,240
vulnerabilities we went over three

1125
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,560
examples uh they're very iot centric

1126
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,240
vulnerabilities right bluetooth and con

1127
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,960
man are very commonly used in iot

1128
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,880
bluetooth of course being a very

1129
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,000
uh

1130
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,480
well-supported wireless technology for

1131
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,160
cable replacement your car supports

1132
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,079
bluetooth your headphones are bluetooth

1133
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,920
your smartwatches bluetooth your fitbit

1134
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,440
is bluetooth

1135
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,839
very common in the iot world and so is

1136
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,839
con man for the same reason

1137
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,240
it's easy to use it's lightweight and

1138
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,839
it's very

1139
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:47,119
popular among embedded linux devices so

1140
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,480
that kind of

1141
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,440
adds to that same iot

1142
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,200
centric

1143
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,560
you know

1144
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,079
evolution of the vehicle where the

1145
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,160
vehicle is now becoming part of the iot

1146
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,680
and maybe somebody in the marketing

1147
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,680
department took that a bit too literally

1148
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,680
and now they're they're developing with

1149
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,000
with iot software in these you know

1150
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,760
production automotive industry-grade

1151
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,119
vehicles now

1152
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,359
right and they were performed on modern

1153
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,040
vehicles right it's one thing i love

1154
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,040
talking about is because remember what i

1155
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,280
said tesla is the car of the future

1156
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,720
yeah but it's also got all the

1157
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,640
vulnerabilities of the future

1158
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,839
so

1159
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,480
the fact that all of these issues may

1160
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,000
seem like oh my god how did they let

1161
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,599
that get in there how did they implement

1162
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,599
this you know this feature without

1163
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,440
having signature checks on all the

1164
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,880
firmware upgrades

1165
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,119
unfortunately it does happen and and the

1166
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,880
automotive industry is still trying to

1167
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,960
catch up and get ahead of these problems

1168
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,359
before you know self-driving cars become

1169
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,280
very widespread in the world because

1170
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,359
that's really when this kind of

1171
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,800
lack of

1172
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,359
due diligence on the automaker's part

1173
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,440
may end up costing someone

1174
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,599
the ultimate price right

1175
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:54,960
um and then you know you have to give a

1176
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,640
shout out to tesla and the ability to

1177
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,040
update their software over the air

1178
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,119
if this had happened to a car without

1179
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,119
that capability right when you consider

1180
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,720
two of our

1181
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,920
case studies today had to do with teslas

1182
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,440
the fact that they have the ability to

1183
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,280
update their software and remotely patch

1184
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,520
any kind of vulnerabilities of this sort

1185
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,960
is really a blessing for them and

1186
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,480
something we're likely to see more of in

1187
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,839
the future

1188
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,640
but other auto makers really have to

1189
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,200
kind of follow follow suit there

1190
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,079
and the fact that these are all

1191
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,839
post-production vehicles ties into the

1192
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:27,680
first the previous point these are all

1193
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,599
vehicles that were on the road people

1194
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,040
were sitting in these vehicles driving

1195
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,880
them to work every day driving them on

1196
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,480
the highway driving their kids home from

1197
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,520
school

1198
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,560
and you know god forbid if if this

1199
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,000
knowledge got into the wrong hands

1200
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,839
somebody may have been able to

1201
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,520
you know make use of it in a malicious

1202
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,760
manner uh and

1203
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,560
it all ties back to

1204
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,920
preventing this from happening in the

1205
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,920
future so how exactly

1206
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,359
would you prevent this from happening in

1207
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:54,720
the future

1208
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,920
of course we talked a little bit about

1209
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,000
the new standards and legislation

1210
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,240
that are kind of being introduced into

1211
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,079
the automotive industry the united

1212
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:06,160
nations wp-29 as well as the iso 2144

1213
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,720
these security

1214
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,640
recommendations and best practices need

1215
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,319
to eventually make their way into the

1216
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,640
development process for a vehicle and it

1217
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,480
can't just be a one step okay we did the

1218
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,319
cyber security check now it's over

1219
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,880
security on such a complicated

1220
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,880
product such as a vehicle is much more

1221
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,560
involved than that you have to make sure

1222
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,400
you're going through with all of your

1223
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,000
suppliers and making sure their products

1224
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,920
are secure and that they're doing checks

1225
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,800
it's it's quite the task

1226
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,640
a training for engineers and development

1227
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,040
managers right maybe for the managers

1228
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,480
they don't need to have knowledge of all

1229
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,960
the different attack patterns and how

1230
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,720
you might actually perform an attack on

1231
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,960
a car but the

1232
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,560
anyone in that position would still need

1233
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,319
to have an awareness of what cyber

1234
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,560
security means for a vehicle what should

1235
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,960
they consider when making design choices

1236
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,280
for the vehicle or their components to

1237
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,760
ensure that they minimize the risk of a

1238
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,440
cyber security incident as much as

1239
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,040
possible of course it's too immature to

1240
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,200
say that with enough

1241
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,040
effort you know this device will never

1242
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,560
ever be hacked until the heat death of

1243
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,640
the universe that's simply not true that

1244
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,880
just doesn't exist it's a it's a fact of

1245
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,119
life that everything can be hacked given

1246
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,440
enough time but it's our job to do our

1247
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,920
best to to bring that possibility as

1248
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,920
close to zero as possible

1249
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,599
and then comprehensive product

1250
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,359
vulnerability management

1251
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,839
this is something that i think really

1252
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:27,599
needs to take off in the automotive

1253
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,839
industry every oem needs to be ready to

1254
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,240
act on the new vulnerability manager

1255
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,040
excuse me new vulnerability information

1256
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,640
and understand

1257
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,720
if and when this applies to any of their

1258
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,960
products if we think back to the lexus

1259
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,160
example

1260
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,920
in the event that you know the

1261
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,599
vulnerability that led to the initial

1262
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,720
rce was as a matter of fact blueborne

1263
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,440
blueborne had been you know

1264
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,839
publicized for about three years prior

1265
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,400
to this research's release

1266
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,359
right

1267
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,280
because it was

1268
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,480
bluetooth vulnerability right maybe

1269
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,040
no one made the connection that hey

1270
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,960
cars have bluetooth in them

1271
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,119
we should make sure that none of our

1272
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,119
products currently on the market

1273
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,480
have

1274
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,040
you know susceptibility to this suite of

1275
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:15,920
high

1276
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,440
impact vulnerabilities that could lead

1277
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,160
to remote code execution maybe that

1278
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,760
context shift just didn't make it all

1279
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,079
the way over

1280
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,440
product vulnerability management

1281
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,480
involves knowing all of your products

1282
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,560
knowing what goes into them hardware and

1283
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,680
software

1284
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,480
and

1285
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,040
triaging information right as

1286
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,119
vulnerability information gets released

1287
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:39,200
into different sources different

1288
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,920
talks etc etc you need to have an intake

1289
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,319
of that process it properly and be able

1290
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,400
to apply it to your own products in the

1291
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,560
event it's relevant make

1292
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,480
excuse me make accurate decisions on

1293
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,079
whether or not it affects any of your

1294
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:53,839
products and then of course the action

1295
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:54,880
part

1296
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,800
is the most important how do you solve

1297
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,520
it do you have to recall

1298
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,680
two million vehicles so you send out a

1299
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,079
software update do you just work into

1300
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,920
the next patch of regular updates based

1301
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,760
on severity all of these things are

1302
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,240
parts of the automotive cyber security

1303
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,640
life cycle that will come around i have

1304
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,480
confidence in it but they're still kind

1305
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,720
of making their way in and it's

1306
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,800
definitely going to be a while before

1307
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,839
they're

1308
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:23,920
really very widespread throughout the

1309
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,160
industry so here is a list of the

1310
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,880
references that i used in this talk of

1311
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,880
course once again i want to give all the

1312
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,560
credit due in the world to the actual

1313
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,920
researchers that did such a great job

1314
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,440
on their

1315
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,480
on

1316
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,240
this research that they've presented and

1317
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,599
that i was you know able to share with

1318
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:43,040
you today hopefully you learned

1319
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,000
something

1320
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,280
car hacking is very fun and a very

1321
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,760
how should i say enjoyable

1322
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,839
field to be in and maybe if it's not

1323
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:53,520
obvious i really enjoy what i do and i'd

1324
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,440
be happy to help any of you get into car

1325
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,400
hacking

1326
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,880
if you are interested in any

1327
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,400
way at all feel free to look me up on

1328
