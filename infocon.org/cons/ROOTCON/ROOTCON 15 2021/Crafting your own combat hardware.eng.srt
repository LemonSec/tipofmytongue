36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,400
okay thanks luis

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,079
so now uh

38
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,320
going to the talk topic

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,920
this is one of

40
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,119
our talks which is actually a chapter

41
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,399
of an episode we can say of an entire

42
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,960
series of talks which we call a visit to

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,159
the armory

44
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,479
our armory is basically

45
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,880
a repositories containing all sorts of

46
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,479
weaponized domestic hardware it's purely

47
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,119
oriented to hardware hacking

48
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,479
and this

49
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,960
this hardware is mostly intended for red

50
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,079
teamers

51
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,799
and infiltration teams and

52
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,360
infiltration exercise retiming exercise

53
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,239
and all sorts of physical offensive

54
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,440
exercise

55
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,680
so you can find a lot of really cool

56
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,040
gadgets there

57
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,000
all of them have open source versions

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,959
and you can find bad usb power banks

59
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,000
speakers keyboards which are banded with

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,040
a hardware keylogger

61
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,760
all of them works as bad usb we even

62
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,640
have

63
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,680
an entire bad usb framework which

64
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,239
features a lot of access methods a lot

65
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,640
of attack vectors

66
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,959
all of them are available on our github

67
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,040
which will be disclosed at the end of

68
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,640
the talk it will be shared there and you

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,560
can have access to the entire

70
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,640
repositories

71
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,120
obviously you will be free to clone and

72
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,000
to create your own gadgets and we are

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,480
really looking forward for that so

74
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,120
if you have any project based on one of

75
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,319
our

76
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,879
uh projects from the armory we will be

77
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,840
more than happy to take a look at it

78
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,200
so today

79
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,000
and obviously uh just for a matter of

80
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,720
time we can show all of these projects

81
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,400
that were listed here

82
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,599
but today we will present three of this

83
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,480
one of them are really new

84
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,640
a third one it's actually something

85
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,720
which is in development so it's still

86
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,879
not released but we are going to

87
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,480
give like um

88
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,920
a sneak peek

89
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,159
we will see how to build smart movement

90
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,360
sensors

91
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,519
again with open source hardware for all

92
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,879
three projects

93
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,280
the author charts which should not be

94
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,959
confused with jammers or signatures or

95
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,840
something like that it's the

96
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,040
author we will see the difference in a

97
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,840
few

98
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,519
and a sort of inline suite which

99
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,920
is the improvers project we are having

100
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,599
the in development one

101
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,439
which tries to build open source cameras

102
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,280
with uh different

103
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,080
smart features

104
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,239
so uh we can take a small look at what

105
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,760
we have here

106
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,080
all of these projects do not are not

107
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,640
finished as you can see only one has a

108
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,040
case the other ones are just

109
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,000
uh raw only the the components this is

110
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
intended for you to see

111
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,479
that we are using real cheap hardware on

112
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,240
some and

113
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,360
real simple and easy to acquire hardware

114
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,479
so

115
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,680
even newcomers or experienced users can

116
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,759
take a hold of this talk and say okay

117
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,680
i'm going to jump into hardware hacking

118
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,600
or i am experienced at harvard hacker

119
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,960
but i'm going to do something different

120
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,199
today so

121
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,199
do not be afraid these are pretty

122
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,520
approachable projects as you can see

123
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,759
here and we will try to

124
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,800
discuss them to show them in the most

125
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,680
simple and friendly way for you to

126
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,880
to better understand it

127
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,280
all of these projects as i said before

128
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,800
are open source

129
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,520
you can visit our github here and see

130
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,840
all of our open source projects not only

131
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,680
on dash armory but on dc5411 user on

132
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,720
github

133
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,600
and obviously feel free to do

134
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,919
your own versions and to your own

135
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,440
spin-off to do whatever you want with it

136
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,680
let's start with the sensors the first

137
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,360
part

138
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,680
so for the hardware we will need some

139
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,160
really easy to get pieces and really

140
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,840
cheap by the way

141
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,360
we will need a popular

142
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,039
esp8266 board

143
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,440
any standard infrared sensor pick the

144
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,280
one you like most

145
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,160
nine volt battery or in case you want to

146
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,080
build something

147
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,520
um

148
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,720
with a higher budget and more bulkier

149
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,199
you can pick up a

150
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,800
power bank

151
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,319
a portable battery but you will be using

152
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,400
more than one sensor so this can

153
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,120
definitely rise the price up

154
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,479
power switch

155
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,720
and a disguise case which can be a 3d

156
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,880
printed one or an existing object like

157
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,000
uh

158
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,759
like an electrical box

159
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,000
the point here is that this hardware

160
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,319
will be used on physical

161
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,880
pen testing exercises or

162
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,800
red teaming exercises

163
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,840
so creativity here is a must and it's

164
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,919
definitely a bonus

165
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,440
so

166
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,000
try to use your imagination on where is

167
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,759
the best spot to hide one of these

168
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,120
sensors

169
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,759
now in case you want to add

170
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,160
these sensors to certain surfaces you

171
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,319
can use any adhesive patch or even

172
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,000
double face tape

173
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,840
we made our test with double-faced tape

174
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,080
and it worked like a charm because

175
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,919
it's pretty lightweight

176
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,960
now if you want to add a power bank here

177
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,520
i really discourage the use of anything

178
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,800
adhesive

179
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,319
that way it will carry it down

180
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,000
definitely

181
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,400
for the software we have you covered

182
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,720
we have our own film war which is again

183
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,919
open source

184
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,960
and the situ server which is written in

185
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,440
php uses mysql

186
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,479
and uses our own web application and all

187
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,440
this can be dockerized if you want

188
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,759
now for the client we have you covered

189
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,400
too we have a web application which is

190
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,080
the thin client

191
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,360
and a thick client which is a mobile apk

192
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,400
in case you prefer it

193
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,479
now let's take a look at the schematic

194
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,280
this is pretty simple this is how almost

195
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,520
any infrared sensor is connected to this

196
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,280
kind of board

197
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,080
and now you may ask okay white esp8266

198
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,880
well

199
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,759
actually we need the wi-fi enabled

200
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,840
capabilities of this board

201
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,638
for the next step

202
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,120
there are a couple of things that you

203
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,039
must have in mind before using the

204
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,479
sensors

205
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,039
the sensor will definitely need a way to

206
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,840
communicate so we will use wi-fi this is

207
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,440
why we have chosen esp8266

208
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,879
um

209
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,680
depending on the task these operators

210
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,160
physical red teamers sorry physical pen

211
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,000
testers red teamers

212
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,639
can either use a phone as a hotspot to

213
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,120
share its lte connection

214
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,960
or

215
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,280
they can use a portable hotspot device

216
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,039
for a longer coverage

217
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,960
using a phone maybe it's not the best

218
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,680
way

219
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,080
if you are carrying it with you uh you

220
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,080
will probably run into problems into

221
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,080
connectivity problems if you

222
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,279
if you

223
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,080
walk away a long distance from the

224
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,640
sensors

225
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,839
also

226
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,760
depending on the

227
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,880
building layout or your pen testing you

228
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,880
can have definitely connectivity

229
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,200
problems for example on older office

230
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,560
blocks

231
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,920
now we are trying on a new feature

232
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,959
we are trying to integrate and

233
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,959
sim 800l

234
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,000
which provide us with a sim card reader

235
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,920
and obviously by providing a 4g enabled

236
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,040
lte sim card we have the chance to use

237
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,279
that connectivity

238
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,839
but by the way we are just still

239
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,240
researching this topic so

240
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,040
we have used zm800l before on different

241
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,399
projects but

242
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,640
never on this kind of

243
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,120
hardware so it may take a while before

244
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,200
we release a version that might feature

245
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,920
it

246
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,600
and once again we're still researching

247
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,880
it

248
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,880
now both the sensors and the phone will

249
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,600
interact via the c2 server which can be

250
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,080
located outside the premises on a docker

251
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,440
container

252
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,480
or if you have a phone which is capable

253
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,640
of running a web server

254
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,120
and a small database well you can have

255
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,360
it in a portable way too

256
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,160
now whenever something alters the sensor

257
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,320
it will trigger a really primitive

258
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,360
reaction the sensor will notify you

259
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,079
with a push notification

260
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,240
to your mob your mobile phone in case

261
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,240
you're using the apk

262
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,040
or

263
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,000
it will turn itself uh

264
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,320
in a notification

265
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,519
for your browser if you're using the

266
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,200
theme client

267
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,720
so you will see

268
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,279
in a graphic way that something went

269
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,079
wrong

270
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,560
with and on which sensor this happened

271
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,440
now as you can see here

272
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,320
the database connection is quite simple

273
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,279
mysql is not even mandatory we have that

274
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,880
tested it is uh with sqlite

275
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,440
so we can even reduce it further and

276
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,399
make a way more minimalistic

277
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,279
application for this

278
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,880
again we are just making the

279
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,240
communication

280
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,160
pretty straightforward and simple with

281
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,360
the database backend

282
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,959
and you can browse it with even the

283
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,360
the simplest tool like php my admin and

284
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,720
you can see that

285
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,200
it's a quite simple database again

286
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,440
sqlite will work like a charm here too

287
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,000
now our finger

288
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,720
doesn't just uh something quite

289
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,320
different than

290
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,640
a common sensor's finger

291
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,640
the only thing here is that it will work

292
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,360
uh back and forth to the situ server to

293
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,279
communicate things but

294
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,399
outside of that it works like almost any

295
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,800
other sensors feeling where you can find

296
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,920
out there

297
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,720
so

298
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,680
it's a quite small it's quite simple

299
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,920
and it just gets the job done and

300
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,959
nothing else

301
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,000
this is

302
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,079
our thin client

303
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,760
for uh on a desktop browser

304
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,920
in this case this is in spanish but it's

305
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,240
quite intuitive what it says sensor one

306
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,200
is deactivated and so one for the two

307
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
three and four one

308
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,240
and the reset button

309
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,760
now this is the same client located on a

310
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,880
mobile phone built on a mobile browser

311
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,959
again this is exactly the same you can

312
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,480
reset them

313
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,720
using this button so if anything happens

314
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,839
by accident or if anything happens and

315
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,000
you need to reboot the sensor you don't

316
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,440
have to

317
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,320
access physically to it you can just

318
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,839
send the reboot command from here

319
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,800
now this is what happens when all these

320
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,200
sensors are activated another will be

321
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,519
triggered and

322
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,000
one of the best advantages we have here

323
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,200
is that

324
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,040
you can

325
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,639
programmatically

326
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,279
alter this firmware to do whatever you

327
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,680
want when a sensor is activated for

328
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,519
example in our case

329
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,839
we use a feature that

330
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,880
just gently makes the phone vibrate but

331
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,880
on a gently way so it

332
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,240
doesn't quite make a lot of noise

333
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,240
so we will it will uh subtly

334
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,880
warned you that something went wrong

335
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,480
but you can tie this to almost any event

336
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,440
any custom event you want so again play

337
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,480
with your imagination

338
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,560
now this is the thick client in case you

339
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,480
want to use it obviously it will be

340
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,040
uh it will look more raw than the other

341
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,160
one than the web one but nevertheless it

342
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,880
works the same way and it's uh it has

343
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,440
the same reliability

344
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,680
the final product without case is this

345
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,000
one it's quite small just compare it

346
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,440
with the size of the hand and the phone

347
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,199
the quality is not the best because this

348
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,120
is a

349
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,160
photogram of a video

350
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,320
now this is a best a better looking

351
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,079
picture as you can see

352
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,560
this looks like quite simple

353
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,800
this is one of the first prototypes we

354
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,199
have we still have to

355
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,800
make it smaller to make it more

356
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,079
more minimalistic too

357
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,320
now what are the advantages before we

358
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,839
jump into the demo

359
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,360
of using this over a common sensor

360
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,040
well the first one is pretty obvious

361
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,360
this is open source and affordable if

362
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,839
you want to buy already made commercial

363
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,680
sensors it won't be as cheap as this

364
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,440
obviously this is scalable and

365
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,440
extensible you can modify the firewall

366
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,880
you can modify the

367
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,120
client application the c2 so we have

368
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,839
built four sensors by default

369
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,920
but you can add as much as you want this

370
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,279
is

371
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,279
your best um

372
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,199
your best approach you can even group

373
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,199
them and say okay this instance is for

374
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,880
the sensors on the east

375
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,040
this other instance will be for sensors

376
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,360
located on the west so no problem on

377
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,720
that part

378
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,199
now you will have also a smart simple

379
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,279
and intuitive user interface

380
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,480
again you are using php mysql and php my

381
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,279
admin what could possibly go wrong

382
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,839
you are using something

383
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,399
on the client side right you are using

384
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,760
plain html with some css you are not

385
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,480
having to learn react you don't have to

386
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,440
learn

387
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,320
some dark and really extensive framework

388
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,800
it's just plain html and php you can

389
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,040
modify it as you wish

390
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,360
and now something that i subtly

391
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,839
mentioned it before you are not tired to

392
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,160
a single bend or lock response for

393
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,199
example

394
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,920
if the sensor is distorted

395
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,240
a vendor lock response will be to ring a

396
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,720
bell to sound an alarm to send you a

397
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,440
notification on a highly specific

398
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,320
application issued by the same vendor

399
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,360
but here you can trigger any response

400
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,759
you can add custom hardware like an

401
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,399
arduino or custom software in order to

402
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,959
make these things add on a different way

403
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,320
more suitable

404
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,160
for your needs

405
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,440
so

406
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,839
having said this i think it's time to

407
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,360
jump into the demo

408
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,600
this will be quite simple we don't have

409
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,120
quite a lot to

410
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,600
to show

411
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,240
but the sensor is working

412
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,240
all these sensors which are again

413
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,240
caseless

414
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,959
are placed here and now luis is going to

415
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,720
fist bump them

416
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,720
in order to make them react

417
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,440
as you can see this is instant

418
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
there's almost no delay

419
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,279
this is pretty cheap hardware you can

420
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,320
tie this to any event as i say before

421
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,360
and now

422
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,240
you can say for example okay once

423
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,880
and a specific sensor

424
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,440
it's a storyboard do this but when all

425
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,680
of them are distorted but do that

426
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,680
so this is one of the strong points on

427
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,759
using this open source affordable

428
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,600
hardware

429
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,399
so now let's jump to a little bit more

430
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,839
complex topic

431
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,199
about the the author charges

432
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,079
now

433
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,400
before we start i know this may be a

434
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,559
little bit more complex as i said before

435
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,559
i want to explain the difference between

436
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,520
a signal drummer or wi-fi jammer

437
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,839
and the author

438
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,000
we are not going to build a jammer we

439
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,480
are not going to physically attack

440
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,679
a network

441
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,119
we are not going to electronically

442
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,959
attack a network

443
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:23,839
or

444
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,760
anything similar what we are going to do

445
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,919
is a de-orphan

446
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,280
technique

447
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,360
which is basically sending the oath

448
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,880
packets

449
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,000
on a indiscriminate way to

450
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,280
almost

451
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,120
all the hosts

452
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,440
on a network

453
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,600
so we are going to use a firmware

454
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,960
provided by

455
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,360
a third party by another person which

456
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,440
specifically asked people to do not

457
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,720
confuse

458
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,640
jamming with the authen

459
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,240
so this is why i wanted to make this

460
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,400
clarification now professor lewis is

461
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,320
going to

462
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,160
to share with us a little bit more about

463
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,160
this church so please please go ahead

464
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,160
thanks mavro

465
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,960
so the next artificer we are going to

466
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,679
show wi-fi that checker

467
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,640
in order to wield this divided your

468
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,760
dream the file and component

469
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,600
include airport software at the hardware

470
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,799
on the hardware side with nin

471
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:30,240
and usb into ccs and usb powerban

472
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,400
a power switch

473
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,320
casts a 3d print

474
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,280
which is optional and no shot in

475
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,960
distance

476
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,720
adhesive pass

477
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,080
or any other received compound

478
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,039
no

479
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,559
on the software side well we'll name one

480
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,840
of the filing tools staining

481
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,480
especially home field work

482
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,799
this is the classic one

483
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,240
which were perfectly fine how the boss

484
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,039
bed

485
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,919
provide threaten the most default i

486
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:04,720
think

487
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,919
and configuration commander

488
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,200
we will set up

489
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,640
pca fir were passed dc and modify

490
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,120
firmware password

491
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,840
which provides some extra really

492
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,000
specific accumulate

493
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,919
light millikin anxiety from popular

494
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,280
national asp

495
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,679
regardless of georgetown

496
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,080
you will be able to be the char unless

497
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,320
basset fisher to round the software you

498
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,240
will a civil

499
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,919
new arduino id so you can

500
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,600
pure firmware to

501
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,559
asp82c6 device

502
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,120
this is a width of the classic firmware

503
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,840
breathing the original order is bring or

504
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,120
cc's postponed and will allow you they

505
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,440
have wi-fi devices

506
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,039
so what edf

507
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,880
will explain simple

508
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,600
they ask for the authentication attack

509
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,760
t is an attack

510
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,039
turn the current wi-fi negotiation

511
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,280
duping the light between two devices

512
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,240
say for example and cellphone and the

513
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,400
router

514
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,000
this shot nobe can you win jamming

515
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,080
the wi-fi protocol constrain the

516
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,440
propagation for the authentication frame

517
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,200
setting the frame for the access point

518
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,400
and station is the way of disconnecting

519
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
a specific device

520
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,640
any attacker can export

521
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,120
the authentication female

522
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,120
and sing in the rounder and

523
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,840
width and fade matte others

524
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,640
disconnecting and so specifically

525
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,840
this attack can be carrying out with the

526
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,360
easiest to graphical with user interface

527
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,320
the firmware with adobe k scan for a

528
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,679
viable

529
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,039
access point

530
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,600
provide unleash and load the attacker to

531
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,799
kehl a specific attack routine in the

532
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,760
uninterrupted way

533
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,240
here we have an example of the most

534
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,760
popular attack

535
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,760
the bacon flu and the death attack

536
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,880
the first and is named seagulls and flow

537
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,480
which meant massive saving frequency

538
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,679
indica and charger will flow the network

539
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,280
with weight gains

540
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,000
which are wi-fi the authenticity

541
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,600
for adapter leads on the third menu

542
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,559
this will send an enormous amount of

543
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,240
bitcoins

544
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,440
which translate into a lot fake wi-fi

545
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,400
the router listing in your device

546
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,520
interface

547
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,320
this can lead to confusion on the

548
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,000
disruption of normal operation depending

549
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,520
on how in the carry

550
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,960
the second attack in the day which

551
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,760
we

552
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,799
feel explaining before an attack sent

553
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,280
and the day of frame which is put map

554
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,400
address

555
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,520
which belonged to another wish divide

556
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,280
the row that received

557
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,559
in authenticate the victim is state of

558
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:25,760
the attacker

559
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,880
when coordinate is attack count

560
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,200
affectable here at normal operation 4

561
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,080
giving vip

562
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,799
this is the final pro with the 3 case

563
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,840
which is still on the develop

564
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,039
he is like with a small and silent

565
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,799
this is a hissing

566
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,159
you can slide deploy his heart

567
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,640
beautifully and unheard

568
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,880
creating cows in maker of second

569
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,520
while making is hard to find

570
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,960
from an operated point of will

571
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,320
this tool

572
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,880
shies the white zone surgical

573
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,360
penetration testing recti

574
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,918
rehearsing re carrying out

575
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,360
as you can see here the levi is waiting

576
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,559
to lacto

577
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,280
the sizing is pretty comfortable

578
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,320
we would

579
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
hitting somewhere

580
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,039
and to also feature a good battery which

581
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,640
will provide power

582
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,240
to the spline

583
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,559
for a good gamble of ours

584
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,440
here a demon mauro will make some

585
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,760
comment about it

586
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,240
okay now it's time for a demo thanks

587
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,200
luis for the briefing

588
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,480
the objective of this demo is to show

589
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,200
how we can disconnect alleged client the

590
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,000
one on the right from the wi-fi network

591
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,880
and

592
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,640
start creating mess

593
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,120
and chaos with the wi-fi

594
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,720
clients here

595
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,039
we will connect the attacker laptop to

596
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,520
our device to the charge

597
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,240
now we will be greeted by the space

598
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,320
hung's framework this is not our

599
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,760
firmware

600
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,360
our firmware is just a patch that adds

601
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,799
local and national ssids which you can

602
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,520
find them like the street free wi-fi and

603
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,480
the

604
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,720
coffee wifis around here

605
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,679
so this will only be used for

606
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,640
when you want to attack by creating fake

607
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,159
aps

608
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,120
but

609
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,559
it won't be

610
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,480
it won't affect

611
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,400
the basic firmware created by the space

612
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,000
hands which is actually a great

613
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,360
framework

614
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,679
now the victim on the right is connected

615
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:48,720
normally

616
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,559
and we will start sending

617
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,960
uh the health attack here

618
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,520
and then we will send a beacon attack

619
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,799
too

620
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:57,600
so

621
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,880
the idea

622
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,080
on our firmware on our patch is to add

623
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,039
like localized versions of the access

624
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,440
points which can be found in the while

625
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,120
here in the streets

626
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,279
but also

627
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,400
we have added some new features

628
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,200
because when running this original

629
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,679
firmware sometimes we run into certain

630
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,039
soft locks

631
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,760
so we have rewritten certain smaller

632
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,080
parts but actually most of the job

633
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,760
remains the same

634
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,919
this is a really great tool if you want

635
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,320
to start playing with wi-fi the authen

636
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,400
and small wi-fi attacks

637
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,240
i really recommend it and it's pretty

638
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,159
cheap to set up

639
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,480
so now this computer will start

640
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,720
experiencing problems because we are

641
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,000
obviously

642
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,080
going to

643
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,279
to flood it with certain requests

644
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,080
now you can see that it starts to fail

645
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,559
now it will have

646
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,200
certain problems loading up youtube

647
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,240
because we are still sending this

648
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,159
packet floating

649
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,600
if we stop it

650
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,320
the connection will eventually recover

651
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,559
slowly

652
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,880
which can be used in red team and to

653
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,000
trigger

654
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,080
a support response

655
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,000
let's say that you want somebody to move

656
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,799
to a rack where the access point is

657
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,080
located

658
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,400
let's say that you have

659
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,960
the it guy to

660
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,320
climb into a table or into a chair

661
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,919
to locate that really highly placed

662
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,480
router or access point to see if he can

663
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,320
reset it

664
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,720
try to use your imagination again what

665
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,720
happens if you start messing

666
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,640
with the wi-fi or hotspot or access

667
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,080
points

668
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,799
in a systematic way you will

669
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,559
sooner or later

670
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,159
make somebody

671
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,799
walk to it and try to see what's going

672
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,480
on

673
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,559
so again if you combine these simple

674
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,679
tools

675
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,080
with a little bit of psychology with a

676
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,039
little bit of social engineering with

677
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,480
which uh almost any physical pentester

678
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,400
or red teamer should have

679
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,640
you will have a really nice time a real

680
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,559
nice time

681
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:13,360
so

682
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,520
once again we start sending this attack

683
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,919
and the machine is absolutely locked out

684
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,520
of accessing

685
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,559
remember

686
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,799
the idea here is not to cause damage you

687
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,880
don't want to cause damage what you want

688
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,600
here is to bring up certain attention

689
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,679
you want to get attention on a certain

690
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,080
point you want to make your exercise

691
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,360
easier

692
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,520
this is why we came out with this with a

693
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,159
power battery to make it portable

694
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,120
okay time to move on

695
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,279
so what are the advantages over a

696
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,159
classic deployment model

697
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,480
in this case we are being battery

698
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,480
powered so we are making it portable as

699
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,799
it says just some seconds ago

700
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,520
this custom third one adds and certain

701
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,200
translations common local ssid names

702
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,880
and simplifies certain operations but

703
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,360
once again most of the firmware is left

704
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,279
on touch

705
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,240
now if you have any custom discrete case

706
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,240
again

707
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,200
3d printed or something

708
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,559
uh

709
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,520
some something existing object like

710
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,200
uh electrical box uh a fake band or

711
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,480
whatever

712
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,960
you can deploy this

713
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,600
on a really creative ways

714
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,440
and also adding lc patches or double

715
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,720
sided

716
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,320
tape can

717
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,840
make this object really

718
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
hard to be

719
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,320
really hard to be seen to be detected

720
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,840
and also

721
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,960
try to use your imagination again and

722
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,679
what happens if you place this object in

723
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,240
a really weird place

724
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,080
it will still cause damage and it will

725
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,840
be really hard to be located or at least

726
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,039
it would be really hard to be dealt with

727
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,520
now uh this is standardized size which

728
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,039
we are trying to maintain across all our

729
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,279
combat hardware

730
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,480
it's used to disguise this charge now

731
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,039
try to picture if you try to use this in

732
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,120
a fake wall socket

733
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,000
or

734
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,279
under that desk or under a chair type it

735
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,399
right

736
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,720
or for example inside a closet or

737
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,159
whatever it will be really hard

738
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,760
on this uh

739
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,279
on the spot

740
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,440
to be dealt with and that's one of the

741
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,200
advantages here

742
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,480
so now moving on to the next part we

743
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,600
will talk a little bit about

744
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,080
surveillance this is a small project

745
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,480
which is still being developed we still

746
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,480
have a lot of things to do but we still

747
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,720
wanted to share it with you today

748
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,120
so let's get to it

749
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,760
so for this part you won't need

750
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,039
a real complex hardware or anything

751
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,320
expensive

752
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,159
but you will need something different

753
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,279
this time

754
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,240
we are using an sp32 cam

755
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,399
and usb power bank or

756
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,760
a 9 volt battery in case you prefer

757
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,440
an infrared sensor which it's

758
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,600
optional in this case

759
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,760
a power switch

760
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,960
a case which can be again 3d printed or

761
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,880
something to consider this width this is

762
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,000
optional

763
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,760
and another c patch

764
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,080
or double sided tape which again is

765
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,360
optional

766
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,880
and for the software

767
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,240
this time we are going pretty

768
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,760
minimalistic

769
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,399
we're going to use our own firmware and

770
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,440
flask a flash application on python

771
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,880
for our c2 server

772
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,360
this is the basic product outline

773
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,159
with

774
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,880
its 3d printed case as you can see we

775
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,840
are using something really really simple

776
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,080
here

777
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,960
this is the c2 server which is the

778
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,240
application

779
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,799
again using flask which turns this to

780
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,080
a real

781
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,960
basic thing not real complex

782
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,120
as you can see we have just a few

783
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,200
endpoints the application is not big at

784
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,360
all

785
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,960
and we have implemented a recording

786
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,320
script using numpy and cv2

787
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,480
actually the idea here is not only to

788
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,000
record

789
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,799
video of this camera but also to take

790
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,799
specific screenshots in case you need

791
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,760
them that's the idea to have both

792
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,519
screenshots and

793
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,080
recordings

794
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,640
as you can see so far so good we were

795
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,640
able to make a lot of screenshots and

796
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,840
captures over time

797
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,240
um these camera things

798
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,640
works on a real similar thing as

799
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,120
something that you have seen before

800
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,960
the sensors

801
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,600
actually we are building again a thick

802
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,200
client i think lion

803
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,440
everything on top of the sensors

804
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,600
software that we have built before

805
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,240
the idea and you can see this on the

806
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,720
buttons and on the labels that are

807
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,559
they are still placeholders they're

808
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,600
still not

809
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,760
translated strings actually

810
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,080
this is because this is in development

811
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,600
but the idea is to have the four cameras

812
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,519
tied to the sensors

813
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,240
so in case something happens in case

814
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,279
sensor one is triggered you can order

815
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,559
can one

816
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,880
to turn on and start recording but the

817
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,519
idea is that cam one

818
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,039
can be

819
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,760
the same as sensor the same device or

820
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,640
can be a separate device so let's say

821
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,880
that someone triggers a sensor

822
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,120
while entering a corridor

823
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,200
but you want the camera to be located at

824
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,360
the end of the corridor you can do so

825
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,519
and you can tie them together

826
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,440
that's the main idea but it's still in

827
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,720
development

828
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,760
but let's say that you want

829
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,799
your camera to use it's

830
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,279
implemented it's internal sensor

831
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,960
well you can do that too

832
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,480
you can have these events being fed

833
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,679
separately a sensor triggers app and the

834
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,600
camera turns on

835
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,000
or the camera itself using the sensor

836
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,159
trigger sub are recording

837
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,279
this is uh up to the pen tester up to

838
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,240
the red teamer about what

839
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,080
his or her desires are

840
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,840
we can see that the quality of the

841
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,559
camera is acceptable it's not something

842
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,480
that will go full

843
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,440
hd but it will get you along at least

844
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,720
it will get you going

845
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,880
and something that it's pretty

846
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,519
experimental but we are still insisting

847
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,200
on it we're trying to add a.i but you

848
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,120
are st we are still putting up a fight

849
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,240
with this

850
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,360
but the idea still remains that maybe in

851
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,200
a future release or maybe in the first

852
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,080
release to be honest we may be able to

853
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,600
implement it

854
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,399
now we'll have a real real short demo

855
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,960
because this is

856
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,119
another finished product

857
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,199
and so far

858
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,918
this smaller part is the

859
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,679
camera

860
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,560
uh the properly side camera

861
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,800
and the part behind it's

862
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,119
a power bank too

863
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,280
so we're trying to build

864
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,280
everything together and we can make it

865
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,199
fit into a box this is only um

866
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,359
an early stage we are obviously not

867
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:36,399
going to

868
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,399
ship a product like this

869
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,800
but it's still something that we are

870
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,800
playing around with and we will be more

871
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,800
than happy to bring up

872
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,639
maybe in the next

873
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:47,599
um

874
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,919
in an exhibit here at root can't

875
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,599
this is a

876
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,040
small draft of what it will be the 3d

877
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,040
printed case this is pretty simple built

878
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,040
on plus so there's nothing really

879
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,400
outstanding

880
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,680
it's not so weak either this uh

881
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,839
this can be fit inside

882
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,520
your fist

883
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,920
inside your hand

884
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,079
now we'll jump into a really short demo

885
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,440
to see how they work okay time for the

886
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,839
short demo

887
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,880
as you can see we have here the cases

888
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,320
and the intestine product

889
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,440
we have here our main dashboard

890
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,240
where you can see all of the cameras and

891
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,560
which can be activated on demand and

892
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,359
also be controlled remotely using this

893
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,759
client

894
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,320
these are the four ones with its four

895
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,599
power banks

896
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,599
as you can see the frame rate it's not

897
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,560
the best on the esp32

898
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,000
but

899
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,520
it's still some

900
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,440
something that

901
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,119
may work and

902
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,079
may be

903
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,960
useful in certain cases

904
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,359
we will open a new tab the remote

905
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,000
controller

906
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,680
now

907
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,320
with this remote controllers which will

908
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,599
have a better frame rate

909
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,040
but we still rely on local dependencies

910
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,720
to be installed

911
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,800
so that's the difference between um this

912
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,280
thing client is web app and the thick

913
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,680
client which will provide a better frame

914
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,160
rate but you will definitely need a

915
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,520
laptop

916
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,200
it will definitely

917
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,640
be

918
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,119
left outside if you use mobile devices

919
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,520
for this

920
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,400
now the idea is to start recording and

921
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,520
keep this recording of these cameras in

922
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,200
the laptop

923
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,800
the point is that

924
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,160
remember

925
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,960
our idea is to help them bind to

926
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,320
a sensor

927
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,800
so whenever a sensor it's altered you

928
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,520
can trigger these cameras

929
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,320
so far we don't have the integration

930
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,000
finishing

931
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,760
so remember that this is just a demo

932
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,240
here we have the different recordings

933
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,040
you can have not only recordings or

934
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,440
screenshots you can do a sequential

935
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,880
screenshot

936
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,280
in order to get the feeling

937
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,880
of uh

938
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,320
recording but while not taking so much

939
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,920
disk space

940
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,480
without taking so much storage

941
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,200
so far this is what we have on this

942
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,000
product but we are really looking to

943
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,839
expand it

944
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,759
obviously it will be open source too

945
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,960
okay

946
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,000
so

947
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,200
this is

948
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,640
our

949
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,760
artistic concept of how how it will look

950
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,160
once we have finished this projects and

951
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,480
have tied all of them together

952
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,480
but we are still a little bit far away

953
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,520
from that

954
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,720
so for now i think this is enough

955
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,240
and we are just running over the time so

956
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,440
i think it's time to say goodbye sadly

957
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,440
so time for the conclusions and

958
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,520
questions and answers

959
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,240
our conclusions are pretty simple

960
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,960
once we have

961
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,000
landed a foot on this new age of

962
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,480
cheap embedded hardware which is

963
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,760
almost available for everyone

964
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,839
we have the chance to make infinite

965
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,280
combinations

966
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,800
and make it

967
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,599
increasingly easy to create

968
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,800
implements and hardware to our liking

969
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,839
now

970
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,440
you don't live in the past where you

971
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,280
have to search

972
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,280
a lot for a specific piece now you can

973
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,839
have everything inside a small board and

974
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,920
you can combine it with almost anything

975
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,920
and you can find in most

976
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,400
any documentation online so we have to

977
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,800
take advantage of this

978
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,040
now if you combine this technology with

979
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,520
open source software which again

980
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,160
gives you a wider spectrum of things you

981
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,079
have a lot of documentations you have

982
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,160
free libraries for almost everything in

983
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,359
the world

984
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,920
you have a lot of new flexibility to

985
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,000
create new hardware

986
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
now the final result is not only more

987
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,200
economical

988
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,359
but you are extending the product's

989
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:20,000
lifespan a lot because

990
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,320
you will continually receive updates and

991
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,760
upgrades

992
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,119
and commercial hardware will often

993
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,079
discontinue certain models will

994
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,359
likely

995
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,359
stop supporting certain models while you

996
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:35,200
can still get

997
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,160
a new hole on your own

998
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,720
open source hardware so take advantage

999
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,640
of that you can follow us on twitter

1000

and you can follow us on gitgo on github

1003
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,040
where you can find almost all of our

00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,960
projects there

1005
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,680
um obviously this work will be published

1006
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,520
here on the report which you can see

1007
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,000
below and if you have any questions we

1008
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,640
are more than happy to answer them
