1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,120
hi everyone

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,080
uh good afternoon good good morning good

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,400
afternoon good evening so that's what i

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,800
do it's always a confusion which to

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,920
start off

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,000
so here i'm going to be talking about

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,160
the curious case of knowing the unknown

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,560
before they find you and i am glad to be

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,439
speaking at rootcon 15 today

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,760
a bit about myself i am security

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,000
relations leader at sneak

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,960
and i'm also neck deep into ovas which

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,039
is open web application security project

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,840
a community for application security and

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,840
multiple other aspects i am on their

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,239
global board leading two projects and a

17
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,360
chapter

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,040
i'm also on the review board for some of

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,559
the conferences

20
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,200
in india and around the world apart from

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,360
that i love bringing in more diverse

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,760
people into cyber security so i started

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,440
off with um

24
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,920
with creating awareness and uh

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,680
women and then we thought why don't we

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,280
have something for kids so we started

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,600
off with infosec kids and now

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,760
we've started infosec diversity so even

29
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,600
students and everyone even the elderly

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,159
can join us that's a bit about myself

31
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,560
coming back to the presentation

32
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,880
uh if you look at this picture

33
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,640
and let's take a moment to reflect on

34
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,840
this picture

35
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,320
and when you think about this what comes

36
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,600
to your mind

37
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,479
is it a futuristic outlook of the world

38
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,400
or perhaps the uprising of our

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,400
robots overloads

40
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,880
that happens like we want automation

41
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,799
everywhere

42
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,880
um i asked myself hmm that's interesting

43
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,680
now

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,799
how much

45
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,040
of the information does the robot learn

46
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,400
about our child

47
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,119
and where is the information stoned like

48
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,439
i remember uh these things are getting

49
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,079
stored somewhere right

50
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,880
so are they stored safely

51
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,920
who knows

52
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,560
i think about this where does the robot

53
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,719
get its software updates from

54
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,320
and can the stream source be compromised

55
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,719
can happen what can happen when it gets

56
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,079
compromised

57
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,320
a lot can happen

58
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,119
so

59
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,679
what's the probability that someone

60
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,120
hacks in and can watch the video feed

61
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,440
or maybe talk to your child when you're

62
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,760
not around because they are able to see

63
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,680
they are able to see what's happening in

64
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,959
the house

65
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,959
these are some of the things that

66
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,599
keep me up at night like i have kids at

67
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,319
home and it scares me there are a lot of

68
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,160
internet connective device which are at

69
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,920
home and we have to be very cautious

70
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,120
about that

71
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,080
now if you are in this talk or if you've

72
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,160
joined this talk that means you care

73
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,720
about software you care about software

74
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,160
security most of all you're curious like

75
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,319
i am i'm always curious about knowing

76
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,760
something new and when the title says

77
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,080
case of something no unknown

78
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,280
so most of all uh how does open source

79
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,000
software's supply chain security work

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,879
impact on all of us

81
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,720
and the open source components that we

82
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,159
use so about open source um when we talk

83
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,560
about the whole environment

84
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,200
we have containerization we have server

85
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,599
less functions we have bare bones we

86
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,480
have ec2 installs and if they bundle up

87
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,040
open source dependencies then the risk

88
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,080
is there

89
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,400
isn't it we've seen a lot of breaches in

90
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,720
the past and yes

91
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,599
the use of open source is accelerating

92
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,159
however with great adoption comes great

93
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,360
responsibility and risk and that's when

94
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,519
when we say that free and open source is

95
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,519
here to stay we have greater

96
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,680
responsibility in that

97
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,640
and the problem is not just that but

98
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,319
using safe base images is is also very

99
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,920
intuitive consider um consistently what

100
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,239
i have seen in the past few month uh

101
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,280
years

102
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,239
year after year we have seen the top 10

103
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,480
docker base images on docker hub

104
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,319
carrying security vulnerabilities in

105
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,519
them by default and the result is docker

106
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,000
images almost always

107
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,720
bring down vulnerabilities um alongside

108
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,519
their

109
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,799
value so it's a big challenge how do you

110
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,680
maintain that and that's why we need

111
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,839
developer first security platform and

112
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,199
that point out the issues in the form of

113
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,440
uh the developers need to understand

114
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,160
that but can we force upon something on

115
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,479
anyone like if somebody asked me that

116
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,600
you have to do that i'll be like i can't

117
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,000
do that like it's not possible for me

118
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,840
and that's when the big big challenge

119
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,320
comes that how exactly i'm going to be

120
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,240
maintaining all of that and that's how

121
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,759
they're showing us how to fix the

122
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,160
problem

123
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,199
now i am thinking but is there a way

124
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,880
that we can educate

125
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,080
or when we talk about we no longer need

126
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,919
to be security engineers we just need to

127
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,919
be developers like we all need to think

128
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,919
from a perspective that we are all

129
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,240
empowered and we are going to fix this

130
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,639
problem that means we need to enable

131
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,960
each other that's a big big big point

132
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,199
comes into picture and

133
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,280
apart from that if we look at the

134
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,360
holistic code the code that makes up an

135
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,280
application has changed

136
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,039
totally changed i've seen a lot of

137
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,280
changes in the past in order to maintain

138
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,840
the pace required to complete um in a

139
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,080
digitally transforming world

140
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,440
application

141
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,160
development has changed 10 to 20 of the

142
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,120
code is actually in-house built

143
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,000
but what about the rest of the code

144
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,880
so that's what it is 80 to 90 of the

145
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,600
code is open source in our application

146
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,680
whatever we say eighty percent of the

147
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,280
vulnerabilities found are in indirect

148
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,120
dependencies so you have code then you

149
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,120
have third party code and then there are

150
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,120
indirect dependencies which are there

151
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,199
and that's when uh if we talk about

152
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,520
containers right can we leave the

153
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,080
containers because they are um they are

154
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,120
the major part of any of our application

155
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,319
and that's when we have to look at how

156
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,560
exactly we are deploying it how are we

157
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,759
trying to

158
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,160
leverage the different uh

159
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,160
ecosystem that we have because we want

160
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,680
everything to be up and running as soon

161
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,240
as possible and think about leveraging

162
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,479
the software supply chain itself which

163
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,479
is providing us the competitive edge

164
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,039
digital transformation uh which is also

165
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,280
changing the risk profile so often

166
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,680
application security teams focus first

167
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,800
on

168
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,600
code with tools like sas das

169
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,919
and as this is a code that their

170
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,000
development teams arrive may be seen as

171
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,360
the primary code but what about the

172
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,880
the open source code

173
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,800
so open source code quickly becomes the

174
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,680
majority of the overall code base as i

175
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,720
said and if it's the overall code base

176
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,560
how are we going to save it

177
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,960
that's going to be very very tricky and

178
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,440
therefore the successful strategy is to

179
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,560
focus first uh around this

180
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,039
around the information that can help us

181
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,199
in getting the information about our

182
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,440
third-party dependencies and not just

183
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,240
that

184
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,840
think about uh

185
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,919
like the infrastructure as a code that

186
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,000
is becoming a big thing because

187
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,479
infrastructure as a code is actually

188
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,560
enabling us to do a lot

189
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,199
if i want to enable or spin up any

190
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,400
environment

191
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,360
uh in just a blink of an eye i need to

192
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,840
run some scripts and it will be done

193
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,560
and think about for uh for or during the

194
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,680
sale

195
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,919
if i want to spin up an instance or

196
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,680
maybe multiple instances if there's a

197
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,199
load which goes high

198
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,280
these infrastructure as code scripts do

199
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,840
help a lot that's just one example but

200
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,000
they are helping us big way

201
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,319
but let's rewind back

202
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,360
in time to get an early glimpse of how

203
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,520
uh how developer perceive the risk of

204
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,039
open source software

205
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,319
uh if i go about in uh in an environment

206
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,120
where in 1984 the

207
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,840
the turing award winning ken thompson

208
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,639
wrote a short essay which titled

209
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,440
reflections on trusting trust

210
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,400
like if i talk about my own assumptions

211
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,199
um i always say zero trust which is

212
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,280
never trust always verify

213
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,039
but in which in his uh article what he

214
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,319
did he actually describes how he added a

215
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,720
backdoor to the login program and then

216
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,240
he continued and added a um like added a

217
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,479
backdoor to the c compiler and then he

218
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,720
further continued this chain of attacks

219
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,240
by backdooring the compiler that

220
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,120
compiles the com compiler so it's like a

221
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,279
chaining of it and that was way back in

222
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,839
1984 but now also we are seeing this

223
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,479
kind of attacks how tricky that could be

224
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,360
how crazy that is now we have seen all

225
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,920
of this from the past so many years but

226
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,880
still

227
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,880
we are again becoming part of the

228
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,880
malware distribution vehicles as we

229
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,959
learned by thompson's trojan horror

230
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,000
story

231
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,959
back in 1984 developers have been

232
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,959
targeted as a vehicle to distribute

233
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,760
malware and backdoors for a long long

234
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,040
time now

235
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,279
and let's explore some recent events

236
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,560
now if i talk about in 2018 the java

237
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,240
stream um

238
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,279
javascript ecosystem witnessed its first

239
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,920
high impact spearheaded surgical attack

240
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,800
targeting maintainers and developers

241
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,360
working in open source ecosystem and

242
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,920
themselves being used as an attack

243
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,480
vehicle to distribute malware or

244
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,959
malicious javascript code designed to

245
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,920
decrypt itself oh my god i i just

246
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,640
think of it and it feels like what is

247
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,920
happening like what's going on around it

248
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,720
and this was very well known um even

249
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,200
stream incident and if i talk about like

250
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,399
furthermore

251
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,120
the even stream existed on the npm

252
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,480
javascript registry since

253
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,040
2011

254
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,360
and practically did not receive any new

255
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,680
releases in the last two years but

256
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,320
gained millions of downloads per week

257
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,760
and you can see the stats which is

258
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,519
happening and out of the blue a person

259
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,680
shows up on the github repository

260
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,920
opening an issue and wanted to help as

261
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,480
its customary and open source code

262
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,800
and they further contribute code with

263
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,959
several put requests then they also

264
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,320
create a pull request that adds a

265
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,279
dependency into even string own package

266
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,720
dependency

267
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,880
oh that sounds fishy now if i go back uh

268
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,839
from that place to now an academic

269
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,760
research

270
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,480
research paper published in 2019

271
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,000
investigated the properties of

272
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,240
language-based software ecosystems and

273
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,040
trust me it's huge it's huge every other

274
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,720
day somebody is coming up with something

275
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,480
new and found

276
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,200
that

277
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,560
61 percent of open source packages on

278
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,279
npm could be considered abandoned

279
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,160
because they did not receive any release

280
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,880
in the prior 12 months and sometimes if

281
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,560
somebody out of the blue comes and says

282
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,880
i want to help and instead of helping

283
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,800
there's something malicious that goes

284
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,720
inside it and somebody might have it as

285
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,000
part of their code

286
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,399
because we have seen cases wherein i

287
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,000
have a code

288
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,240
there are files which i'm not using but

289
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,040
they're still saying in my code why so

290
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,880
they shouldn't be staying and that's

291
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,640
when the state of open source security

292
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,440
comes into picture that how much do we

293
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,200
know about the current state of open

294
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,760
source security and what it entails and

295
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,160
not just about open ecosystem but about

296
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,320
our own environment i've seen cases

297
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,000
where an organization don't know about

298
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,760
their own environment

299
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,000
and that's very very critical and as a

300
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,720
case study we referred to the marked uh

301
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,040
own security vulnerability from several

302
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,160
years back

303
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,320
so marked as a markdown parser for the

304
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,440
web download uh which downloads which

305
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,160
downloaded millions of times a week and

306
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,920
one of the most popular libraries for

307
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,639
this purpose is a javascript and node.js

308
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,760
ecosystem

309
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,560
but one day a security researcher opened

310
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,360
a pull request which repeat reports of

311
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,920
and fixes excesses vulnerability

312
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,040
including

313
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,040
tests for future code regressions as

314
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,320
well as proof of code examples

315
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,800
now as this is open source software

316
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,720
maintainers are really just trying to do

317
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,680
their best but they just can't be there

318
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,480
all the time and there are no legal or

319
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,639
contractual obligations for them to

320
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,360
support you right because we all when we

321
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,920
talk about contributing to open source

322
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,800
we give our best and spare our free time

323
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,360
and valuable time in that so this

324
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,600
vulnerability was left out in the open

325
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,920
and no fix for a year

326
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,519
for an year and if you go back like a

327
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,279
couple of years back what happened to

328
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,639
apache

329
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,800
for a couple of months the vulnerability

330
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,560
was left and what happened a huge breach

331
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,959
and everybody was just talking about it

332
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,320
so the security issues um and proposed

333
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,600
code fixes

334
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,240
which might have opened long back but

335
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,040
people were not checking it every day

336
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,040
now if i talk about

337
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,519
compromising the maintainers account and

338
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,639
when we we are all so much dependent on

339
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,880
open source software we can't ignore the

340
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,000
question of

341
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,639
where we put the trust

342
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,839
and what are our mitigations uh and

343
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,680
security controls to cope up with the

344
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,519
risks involved

345
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,720
and in 2017 a security researcher

346
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,720
working with the node.js foundation

347
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,800
conducted a research in which he wanted

348
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,519
to

349
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,720
assess the state of weak npm credentials

350
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,639
used by the maintainers his work

351
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,040
revealed the devastating truth of

352
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,839
developers lack of security hygiene

353
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,480
and and not just them trust me security

354
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,720
people sometimes misses out on a lot of

355
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,600
things

356
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,399
and so a security researcher was able to

357
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,279
gain

358
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,920
again publish access to 14

359
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,199
of the npm uh or npm js ecosystem

360
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,079
modules that's huge and some of these

361
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,279
modules are downloaded tens of millions

362
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,800
of times a week

363
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,639
that's a huge number and are an

364
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,560
essential and key part of the thriving

365
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,560
javascript ecosystem

366
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,440
the problem was rooted uh with insecure

367
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,600
passwords chosen by well known

368
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,680
maintainers account and such as

369
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,079
literally the word password

370
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,639
think about passwords are like your

371
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,920
toothbrushes

372
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,959
do you

373
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,839
share your toothbrush with anyone ever

374
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,839
no never ever so why do you share your

375
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:30,880
password

376
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,279
that's one key aspect

377
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,440
and as a cyber security expert bruce

378
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,839
schneiser said in his book secrets and

379
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,160
lies humans often represent the weakest

380
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,880
link in the ecosystem or in the chain

381
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,480
now when that happens

382
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,839
how much thought are we giving in the

383
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,360
security of our own development

384
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,800
infrastructure

385
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,279
resources like your the cloud instances

386
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,399
staging environments uh or the build and

387
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,880
continuous integration tooling how often

388
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,120
are we updating them think about visual

389
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,440
studio code visual studio code in

390
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,480
january 2021 a security researcher broke

391
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,959
into uh microsoft visual studio code

392
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,360
github repository essentially providing

393
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,720
him um or the capabilities of making

394
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,040
code modifications uh that sounds

395
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,639
interesting to the popular um and very

396
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,440
very well known ide that many developers

397
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,240
use

398
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,880
and not just them we also use it like i

399
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,120
use it in and out

400
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,800
and when i talk about the downloads

401
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,360
according to statistica there are about

402
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,160
24 million developers worldwide and

403
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,240
that's just the tentative number i'm

404
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,360
telling you

405
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,040
but if they are downloading visual

406
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,399
studio code with like this active number

407
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,839
what is going to happen if there is a

408
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,279
bug that comes in

409
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,279
and diamonds are forever we have reached

410
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,040
a point we take software open source

411
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,880
software for granted

412
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,199
and that we all have to agree whatever

413
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,759
we say we have to do that and open

414
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,279
source registries are open in their

415
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,000
nature and allow developers to openly

416
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,920
push their package to them

417
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,519
now we have come

418
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,279
we have become accustomed to opening an

419
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,880
issue in a project source code

420
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,240
repository

421
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,120
and then asking for help

422
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,600
now asking for a feature asking to get

423
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,639
our bug

424
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,120
fixed for us we import open source

425
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,120
libraries to our projects and we treat

426
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,160
them as if they're unbreakable

427
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,000
and they cannot be broken by anyone

428
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,440
that's where the challenge lies

429
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,240
and

430
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,399
what happens when the maintainers remove

431
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,040
their dependencies out of the registries

432
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,800
this is exactly the story of what

433
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,279
happened in 2016 when a maintainer named

434
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,600
uh azer pulled tens of his open source

435
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,880
packages from npmjs one of them was a

436
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,959
very pivotal package in the ecosystem

437
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,880
and failing to download it now resulted

438
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,600
in a widespread breakage of cis and

439
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,279
install processes

440
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,680
oh god that was very very tricky

441
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,079
and that's when at the very least this

442
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,320
incident showed us two things the

443
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,359
weakness is in how businesses fail to

444
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,280
manage their open source software and

445
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,599
expose their soft spot

446
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,400
and next one is how registries did not

447
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,280
foresee this as a problem and so were

448
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,760
designed or were not designed to handle

449
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,160
these circumstances

450
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,039
so how do you handle them like once

451
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,400
there is a malicious thing which is

452
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,439
going on and then other if maintainer

453
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,320
leaves or removes those packages

454
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,200
how about the what kind of

455
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,919
malicious activities and assets

456
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,520
which can be tried

457
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,320
back to the open source ecosystem right

458
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,799
that's very very tricky and time after

459
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,880
time we find more and more malicious

460
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,080
package uh hitting the npm js ecosystem

461
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,559
and not just npm js ecosystem but other

462
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,679
ecosystems as well but with np and js we

463
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,840
could find out we could actually

464
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,160
find out the recent statistics and if

465
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,400
you accidentally installed one of these

466
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,120
by

467
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,360
a type of sweating mistake or by someone

468
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,200
planting one of these in a nasty

469
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,760
dependency tree your chance of finding

470
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,840
it is basically

471
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,320
zero then what would you do

472
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,440
and malicious package packages are not

473
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,720
just a thing on the javascript ecosystem

474
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,160
on march 2021 more than 3 000 malicious

475
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,720
packages were published on pipeline

476
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,480
registry

477
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,559
what will you do then

478
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,559
like everywhere this is happening and to

479
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,559
further show um to actually um give us

480
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,960
limelight how attackers can harness open

481
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,200
source software to their advantage alex

482
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,679
berson published his research in

483
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,720
february 21 about how he exploited

484
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,039
design flaws and package managers

485
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,000
registries and design and human error to

486
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,200
infiltrate into corporation like

487
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,320
apple

488
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,559
microsoft and many others

489
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,480
so these are small small things which

490
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,720
becomes so big that even we don't get to

491
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,440
know now when that happens are we going

492
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,400
to use these softwares more or less

493
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,000
i would like to leave you with the

494
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,400
following questions to ponder them and

495
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
are we going to have

496
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,039
like more or less of softwares

497
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,000
i can feel that it's going to be more

498
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,760
and are we going to uh trust someone are

499
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,840
we going to have a

500
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,640
trust based on all of these softwares

501
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,799
dependencies and which are being used in

502
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,360
our robotic systems as well

503
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,760
that's going to be very very tricky

504
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,559
and oh looks like we

505
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,400
missed something so what happens is

506
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,720
uh developers often think about security

507
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,480
of their app in terms of vulnerabilities

508
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,640
that lay in the open source dependencies

509
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,720
but uh there's a lot of things which are

510
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,160
missed now let me show you something uh

511
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,880
which actually oh i don't have to show

512
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,360
but i have to give a demo let's go ahead

513
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,360
and see that

514
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,240
okay that's my browser i'm gonna go into

515
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,799
my dev environment

516
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,720
i'm using visual studio code

517
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,039
interestingly right and we were talking

518
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,600
about visual studio code about a lot

519
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,000
so here i have a visual studio code

520
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,400
which has some of the vulnerable

521
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,880
libraries and i have

522
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,159
a website running so i have my ngrok

523
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,960
running and my website is uh infosec one

524
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,280
dinner and grog dot io and if you go to

525
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,400
my website it's actually

526
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,080
infosequanda.com

527
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,240
and if you know me you you'll actually

528
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,400
traverse through my website or even

529
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,880
anyone uh who you know you just go ahead

530
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,280
and try and check out them so

531
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,840
what happens next

532
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,039
maybe there must be something now if i

533
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,960
tell you from a perspective

534
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,440
wherein this is an attacker perspective

535
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,000
i have set up everything possible i have

536
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,600
set up my

537
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,840
system i have set up my visual studio

538
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,840
code my website is running

539
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,960
now

540
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,520
think from a perspective of

541
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,280
a normal developer

542
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,640
now what happens is developer is using

543
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,200
visual studio code like i'm using here

544
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,600
and as part of extensions there are a

545
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,840
lot of extensions that are there now i

546
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,039
use a

547
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,039
instant mark down a lot like i'm a huge

548
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,520
fan of markdown so i'm gonna check what

549
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,000
happens to instant markdown

550
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,559
instant mark

551
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,159
okay it's here

552
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,480
so if you look at the screen instant

553
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,360
markdown says version 1.4.6

554
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,200
interestingly that's fine but there is

555
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,559
an updated version which is there 1.4.7

556
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,360
now

557
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,679
uh i have not updated i am a developer

558
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,440
right now i'm like um

559
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,039
give me some time

560
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,919
uh i will update like i don't update as

561
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,799
soon as the update comes

562
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,600
that's fine but what's next is that this

563
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,120
version this version is vulnerable

564
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,000
what information can i get so there are

565
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,400
some files which are there in the user

566
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,520
home directory and anyone um if let's

567
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,400
say i'll go to my command shell so this

568
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,600
is

569
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,840
a developer's ecosystem

570
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,360
and here i'll go ahead and do ls and if

571
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,600
you see that there are files um which i

572
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,640
have saved um here in the home directory

573
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,320
which a lot of people do and especially

574
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,200
keys and all they do save it and i've

575
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,679
seen it personally so here i have

576
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,120
actually um saved a password file

577
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,640
it could be any other file also it could

578
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,960
be key file also which i want which

579
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,280
attacker might want so

580
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,000
now let's see what is there in the

581
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,360
passwords file oh how scary is this you

582
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,799
have been hacked it could be passwords

583
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,559
also but it is not

584
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,600
so let me do one thing now

585
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,080
as a developer i will visit a malicious

586
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,520
website

587
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,760
and before visiting a malicious website

588
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,159
let me show you i have like just the

589
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,159
simple code and that's all

590
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,880
now the malicious website is infosec

591
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,440
bandhana.ngrok.io

592
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,320
i'll copy that okay i'll just copy it

593
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,720
here

594
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,799
so just for your kind information it's

595
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,960
just running locally which i stopped

596
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,559
after every demo

597
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,480
so you wouldn't be able to do a lot of

598
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,760
stuff

599
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,039
okay yeah i'm gonna go to my browser

600
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,080
going to type ngrok.io

601
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,000
okay something interesting which is

602
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,320
happening oh while it's loading i'm

603
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,360
going to go back and see what exactly is

604
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,880
there

605
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,880
hmm

606
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,760
okay my instant markdown is running now

607
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,120
if you see here

608
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,240
ah

609
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,240
it's just a normal website but it says

610
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,320
you've been hacked how can i be hacked

611
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,120
let me refresh

612
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,600
interestingly what is it coming now i'm

613
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,000
coming back to my system oh if you see

614
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,480
that there are two files what it says

615
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,880
how it's scary you've been hacked

616
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,600
think about as an attacker i'm running

617
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,520
my myself um

618
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,600
running a server which is getting all

619
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,240
these files from the home system or or

620
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,480
home directory now it could be any other

621
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,559
juicy information as well

622
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,559
which can lead to many more critical

623
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,880
things and that can create a lot of

624
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,960
issues for for a developer for

625
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,320
organizations

626
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,120
and

627
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,279
this is just the basic

628
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,760
extension that we use in the visual

629
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,840
studio code but that could be anything

630
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,400
else also now coming back

631
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,559
to my presentation let's go back to the

632
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,000
presentation

633
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,880
your dev environments are very very

634
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,120
important and critical earlier we never

635
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,120
used to think about those environments

636
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,360
or maybe not giving much of the heeds

637
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,960
but now the way these are getting uh

638
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,440
used too much there are vulnerabilities

639
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,279
which are also coming up which needs to

640
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,000
be fixed and these softwares needs to be

641
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,679
updated

642
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,559
and extensions power and ecosystem for

643
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,640
those developers

644
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,039
we can see them and of course many of

645
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,880
these are built with the open source

646
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,000
vulnerabilities that weave just between

647
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,360
them and talking about uh this could be

648
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,919
anything i'll talk about latex workshop

649
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,039
instant markdown rainbow fort open and

650
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,600
default browsers

651
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,360
so what could go wrong and what could

652
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,400
happen

653
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,960
now um if i talk about

654
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,880
like what could be the takeaway from all

655
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,320
of this be aware of what you installed

656
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,159
in your dev environment i have seen

657
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,000
cases wherein there is an application

658
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,760
library or

659
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,799
infrastructure application library or a

660
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,039
kind of a cmdb which is there but it is

661
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,400
never updated

662
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,120
what i download i never document it and

663
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,039
nobody ever gets to know and when

664
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,200
something happens then they realize

665
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,679
oh this is there in our environment and

666
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,720
that creates a lot of issues now

667
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,640
what can help us

668
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,200
always be scanning it is very very

669
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,679
important to scan our ecosystem

670
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,360
there are a lot of tools technologies

671
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,880
from open source to

672
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,120
commercial tools which are available so

673
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,120
it's very very important to understand

674
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,520
our own appetite ecosystem and if you

675
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,039
don't do it

676
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,720
nobody can save us

677
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,520
and

678
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,039
if we are using

679
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,720
the source code to containers to

680
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,679
infrastructure and whatnot it is just

681
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,640
just just going to be very very tricky

682
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,799
now um

683
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,279
when we are talking about all of this

684
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,440
and if you remember that i talked about

685
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,520
indirect dependencies

686
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,000
you you fix the vulnerability in the in

687
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,159
one of the dependencies but there is an

688
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,559
indirect dependency in the application

689
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,840
code

690
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,360
what you need to do is you need to

691
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,679
understand that as well and fix that as

692
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,240
well even if one library is vulnerable

693
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,240
that means your code is vulnerable

694
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,960
i just was able to pick up the password

695
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,200
file from a normal system

696
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,200
but i would i couldn't find any other

697
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,440
information as well i might be able to

698
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,240
take over those accounts and whatnot

699
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,000
so if we don't have the updated

700
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,279
ecosystem

701
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,200
it's like uh

702
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,320
we are not knowing our own house so how

703
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,200
are we gonna save it from the thieves we

704
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,320
can't we would never be able to to do

705
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,880
and that's when we need to maintain uh a

706
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,399
cordial relationship between the

707
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,559
developers and the security teams and

708
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,559
it's it's both of their responsibility

709
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,640
and now when the ecosystem is growing to

710
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,440
the cloud to iot to whatnot

711
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,679
so it becomes even more important to

712
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,200
understand those

713
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,760
those side of the wheels as well and

714
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,320
then only run the car if we don't know

715
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,880
it it's going to get punctured anytime

716
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,559
and we wouldn't be able to fix it if

717
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,840
it's on the road

718
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,679
and there's a lot of hampering that

719
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,159
could go that could go in and a lot of

720
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,240
issues that can arise

721
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,080
i've seen it personally now i'll tell

722
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,919
you one example wherein

723
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,200
there was one time wherein the there was

724
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,760
a vulnerability which was

725
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,600
a medium level vulnerability for which

726
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,520
we thought okay we'll take 15 days and

727
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,960
we'll get it fixed

728
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,640
and that was fine but then there was

729
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,559
some code change happened and due to

730
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,559
which it became a high severity

731
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:11,760
vulnerability

732
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,600
now i had a good relationship with the

733
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,520
teams who were working on those

734
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,520
environments they came back and said

735
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,960
that there are some changes which have

736
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,799
happened can we go ahead and test them

737
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,960
again and can we figure out that what

738
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,000
could have

739
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,440
changed in the environment and we

740
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,360
realized that medium vulnerability

741
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,960
became a critical one

742
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,799
and that's when we could fix it on time

743
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,640
or the things could have gone in a very

744
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,640
total different direction

745
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,559
so knowing um the ecosystem before

746
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,039
somebody else get to know about us

747
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,039
could be very tricky could be could be

748
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,000
uh tricky as well as could also save us

749
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,320
from all the damages which could happen

750
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,200
and

751
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,720
um one point to to say here that is uh

752
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,960
around supply chain security supply

753
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,039
chain security uh

754
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,200
is not new we've seen those cases

755
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,000
arising big time recently but that's

756
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,520
that's not new

757
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,440
so we need to have some kind of an

758
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,600
environment when we can maintain the

759
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,679
sbom which is software bill of materials

760
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,720
around securities of supply supply chain

761
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,520
and

762
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,440
uh fix them

763
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,159
before even somebody tries and hampered

764
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,600
those things

765
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,600
so now

766
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,799
while i'm concluding so i'm part of

767
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,799
sneak so here sneak is coming up with

768
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,360
sneak con which is an open source thing

769
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,919
which you can join in october

770
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,720
and that's the major thing use your

771
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,799
superpowers and especially

772
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,080
not just

773
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,760
for the developers but for security

774
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,440
people because we all are sailing in the

775
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,559
same boat

776
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,360
let's use our superpower and what we can

777
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,679
do is we can only leverage it to build

778
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:48,640
something

779
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,960
good and be excellent without each other

780
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,960
we always know that security community

781
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,200
is the most amazing community where we

782
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,840
all share information and that's why we

783
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,919
are growing big time and people are

784
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,159
getting fascinated about our community

785
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,240
so be good to each other share knowledge

786
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,760
be supportive

787
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,480
and let's not say anything bad about any

788
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,880
of those languages but just be

789
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,559
contributive in updating them

790
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,240
i am so glad to the to be here to be

791
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,120
talking about uh the curious cases of

792
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,279
knowing the unknown like third-party

793
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,240
dependencies which are big big time used

794
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,760
in every environment right and if you

795
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,000
have any inputs around it if you feel

796
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,440
there's something more that i could have

797
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,120
added to it

798
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,080
please do feel free to share and

799
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,880
remember that we are all here

800
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,360
and uh we need to hack the world but

801
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,159
still at the same time we need to secure

802
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:46,880
it

803
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,799
thank you so much for listening to me it

804
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,480
was wonderful

805
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,399
to be here and let's hack the planet
