1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,240
greetings first let me all welcome you

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,920
to con 15.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,919
it's really nice to see how our local

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,080
con have grown a lot over the years and

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,120
even

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,040
these times of the pandemic i think

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,519
groupon is still doing great so thanks

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,920
to everyone who made all this possible

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,119
the root congruence uh the sponsors and

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,960
of course all of the

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,240
attendees

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,960
so let's start with my thought uh

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,960
gathering cyber threat intelligence from

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,000
the cyber criminal underground so first

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,640
some introductions so who am i so i'm

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,879
eric reata i'm a threat intel analyst

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:39,920
with

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,280
fox i.t

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,879
so i'm also

20
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,200
affiliated with some local

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,600
organizations here right sec and

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,280
csp cert

23
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,600
and for this uh presentation i would

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,559
like to give credits first to fast id

25
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,399
for

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,239
some of the research data that i've used

27
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,120
for this presentation and of course for

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,600
uh to dash qa for the data analytics for

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,920
helping me with the graphics and all the

30
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,280
charts i use

31
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,840
in this presentation so with that let's

32
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,320
start

33
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,360
so let's start with a definition of

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,360
cyber threat intelligence

35
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,520
so

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,479
we have this definition from gartner it

37
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,320
says here that threat intelligence is

38
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,560
evidence-based knowledge including

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,200
context mechanisms indicating force

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,640
implications

41
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,040
and actionable advice about an existing

42
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,720
or emerging mayonnaise or hazardous

43
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,240
assets that can be used to inform

44
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,240
decisions regarding the subject's

45
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,640
response to that menace or hazard so

46
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,040
yeah it's quite a mouthful

47
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,920
so

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,960
what is

49
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,960
cyber threat intelligence then so from

50
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,559
that definition we can say that

51
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,680
cyber threat intelligence attempts to be

52
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,280
a proactive

53
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,560
measure of

54
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,600
our organization cyber security

55
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,439
also we can say that it is focused on

56
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,119
data collection and

57
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,318
information analysis of

58
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,160
threats

59
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,879
or adversaries which helps us make

60
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,760
knowledgeable decisions for securing our

61
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,760
organization or responding against

62
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,520
various cyber attacks

63
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,080
also i would like to add that cyber

64
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,400
threat intelligence is not always about

65
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,560
attribution so yeah

66
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,920
it helps with attribution but it's not

67
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,519
all about that

68
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,360
so

69
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,480
there are several levels of uh cti

70
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,560
so we have the strategic operational and

71
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,519
tactical so let's do some like start

72
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,680
from the bottom where we go up so

73
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,519
tactical is the

74
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,720
what of

75
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,440
cyber security so what are the iocs so

76
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,720
what happened

77
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,360
so it falls here so this is usually

78
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,879
consumed by

79
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,519
uh security operators or our socs

80
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,560
those people consume our tactical

81
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,000
intelligence

82
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
on the operational side

83
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,239
on the operational

84
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,319
level

85
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,690
this focus on

86
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,040
[Music]

87
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,879
the where and

88
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,239
how so

89
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,799
how did an incident happen or

90
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,400
this includes like the techniques

91
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,040
tactics and procedures used by threat

92
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,400
actors

93
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,680
and then

94
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,159
where is like where

95
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,239
did it happen so

96
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,280
where should we look for clues for

97
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,040
to help us with the investigation for

98
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,319
example so this includes probably threat

99
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,799
hunting uh network analysis source

100
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,159
analysis malware analysis etc so this is

101
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,840
often used by incident responders

102
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,720
the network and our network defenders as

103
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,760
well

104
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,080
on the strategic level this is like

105
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,920
targeted towards the

106
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,560
c-suites so the car sees those so this

107
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,120
focuses on the who and the wife again

108
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,400
the who attribution so who attack us

109
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,959
so who are the victims as well so that's

110
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,320
very important

111
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,959
so who are the targets but more

112
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,959
importantly the why so we should

113
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,360
understand why are they attacking us so

114
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,440
what are the motivations of the threat

115
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,720
after so we have that uh

116
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,120
for the levels of uh the city of the

117
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,199
cyber threat intelligence and then

118
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,280
we'll have the life cycle threat

119
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,719
intelligence life cycle so

120
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,880
we start with planning and direction so

121
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,440
this is where we identify our

122
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,520
our organization's intelligence

123
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,560
requirements which would guide

124
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,680
our

125
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,759
cyber threat capabilities

126
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,639
and once we define those requirements

127
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,800
we'll have our collection or information

128
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,960
gathering so during this phase

129
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,159
we

130
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,800
we get

131
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,880
our sources from our sources which we'll

132
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,560
discuss later in later slides so we get

133
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,360
from different sources raw data so that

134
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,680
raw data will then be

135
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,039
used in the next

136
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,039
the phase processing

137
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,960
where we try to

138
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,120
convert that data into information so we

139
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,759
try to make sense of it so we validate

140
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,199
it

141
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,400
maybe

142
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,720
using some manual processes but of

143
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,560
course

144
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,280
because of big data so we need to do

145
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,840
some automation and of course maybe we

146
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,639
can use ai machine learning uh natural

147
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,360
language processing and whatnot and then

148
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,880
of course

149
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,560
after that we have analysis and

150
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,039
production so this is where we try to

151
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:53,840
so

152
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,880
if

153
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,880
on the processing phase we turn the raw

154
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,700
data into

155
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,120
[Music]

156
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,639
information

157
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,120
in this phase we try to

158
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,840
convert that information into

159
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,280
intelligence so intelligence is

160
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,720
these are

161
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,000
uh

162
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,240
so what we're trying to create here are

163
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,960
answers for our stakeholders or for the

164
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,080
consumers

165
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,160
so after that we how do we deliver it so

166
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,120
that's

167
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,960
that falls here and dissemination and

168
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,080
feedback

169
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,800
so

170
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,280
the simulation will be how we deliver

171
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,440
our intel so it can be in forms of

172
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,880
reports like analytic reports for uh

173
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,360
the strategic level for example maybe

174
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,840
through feeds or

175
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,639
maybe we can expose some api to consume

176
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,600
our our threat intel so this is where

177
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
your stakes

178
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,880
will

179
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,599
come into play

180
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,360
also maybe you shared through

181
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,319
through

182
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,520
to other organizations through a maybe

183
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,840
misp

184
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,919
or throw another like threat inside this

185
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,680
platform so

186
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,919
this is also in this part and most

187
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,599
importantly i think this is probably the

188
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,520
most important part of this whole cycle

189
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,360
is the feedback

190
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,960
so this is

191
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,759
where

192
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,520
we try to measure the effect the

193
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,199
effectiveness of our

194
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,560
produced intelligence so that's the

195
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,120
whole cycle

196
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,840
so

197
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,599
this is just a quick rundown of the

198
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,960
whole cyber threat uh intelligence stuff

199
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,680
so

200
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,759
that yeah we can

201
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,080
relate that to our

202
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,520
next topics

203
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,120
so we'll just discuss briefly of course

204
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,400
our cyber threat intelligence analyst

205
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,759
looks at

206
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,400
like two places so internal so this

207
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,210
could be your logs

208
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,680
[Music]

209
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,080
maybe you're watching an ongoing attack

210
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,160
or

211
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,960
you're capturing network traffic so

212
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,919
that's

213
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,319
those were those are internal sources

214
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,520
and then

215
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,919
uh of course there are external sources

216
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,000
as well so we're going to focus on that

217
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,599
because our topic

218
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,319
cyber criminal underground it's part of

219
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,800
those external sources so it is

220
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,360
sometimes

221
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,440
not considered or

222
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,800
maybe

223
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,000
most of the threat intelligence

224
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,039
especially those with lower maturity

225
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:27,840
uh

226
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,639
in terms of cyber security

227
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,919
so they try to ignore uh

228
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,519
intelligence coming from the criminal

229
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,279
underground so that's what we're going

230
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,679
to discuss here

231
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,399
so

232
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,320
with that let's discuss some external

233
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,839
collection sources

234
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,560
so first we have open sources so these

235
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,880
are those

236
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,519
we can get

237
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,920
through like what we know as uh open

238
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,240
source intelligence or ocean so this

239
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,800
includes publicly available blogs news

240
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,760
portals social networks so all this uh

241
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,720
stuff

242
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,440
and then we have uh semi-open and not

243
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,720
open sources so this includes

244
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,279
uh four rooms so including those invite

245
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,360
only ones where you need to

246
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,160
uh

247
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,279
have a voucher or you need someone

248
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,440
to invite you to get in

249
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,000
social media groups telegram groups

250
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,519
and of course those that need

251
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,399
specialized software to access like thor

252
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,959
so those onion sites and

253
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,399
uh the other dark

254
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,360
nets so like i took the infinite so

255
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,440
that's part of the

256
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,320
non-open and semi-open sources so this

257
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,839
mostly

258
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,080
uh i'll say is where

259
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,959
the

260
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,160
cyber crime underground operates so

261
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,480
we'll discuss that in

262
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,640
in later slides

263
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,399
and of course another resource can be

264
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,279
online engagement this is when you

265
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,519
actually engage with a threat actor so

266
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,800
you can

267
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,320
engage him through

268
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,839
any communication with you or

269
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,920
maybe through the forums so you can

270
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,600
engage with them and get information

271
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,200
from them so

272
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
that's another source

273
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,440
and of course outreach so things like

274
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,000
this like conferences

275
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,480
where we can get information from

276
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,680
our fellow researchers so that's also

277
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,760
a source of

278
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,120
uh threat

279
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,760
intelligence or information at least

280
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,399
and then of course engagement with

281
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,959
other members of the enforcer community

282
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,560
and law enforcement operation

283
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,839
cooperation

284
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,600
and of course we have technical research

285
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,399
where

286
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,959
you build your own capabilities like

287
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,880
maybe you research malware and try to

288
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,640
uh

289
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,480
like

290
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,399
like honey pots maybe you have honey

291
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,720
pots you have sun boxes

292
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,920
uh

293
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,920
so in other collection uh projects so

294
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,720
we

295
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,200
yeah so those are your technical sources

296
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,600
so

297
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,440
so the cyber crime underground so with

298
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,000
that said so that's just uh like a quick

299
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,079
rundown of what subreddit intelligence

300
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,760
is so it's

301
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,240
in no way uh complete uh

302
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,200
like

303
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,920
information about

304
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,720
cpi but like just the basics that you

305
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,160
need for this

306
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,800
so let's now move to our main topic

307
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,000
which is cyber crime underground

308
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,370
so

309
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,959
[Music]

310
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,560
what is the cyber crime underground

311
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,560
actually

312
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,160
so we have this i know you're very

313
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,240
familiar with this image not exactly

314
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,800
this one but you know when

315
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,480
talking about the dark web you'll

316
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,519
usually

317
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,279
get this image

318
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,320
so they try to integrate stuff and like

319
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,480
where things can be found

320
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,480
can be found but

321
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,959
unfortunately we're not going to do it

322
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,839
here so of course as i've said it's it's

323
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,279
been

324
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,360
discussed a lot uh already so

325
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,000
probably it's like best discussed like

326
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,240
over beers maybe in the root cause party

327
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,720
when we can do it already

328
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,880
so

329
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,519
sour cream underground so what

330
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,360
it is really so

331
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,240
so this is our main focus for this talk

332
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,639
so this is like as i've mentioned one of

333
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,160
the collection sources

334
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,839
so this is as i've said this is not only

335
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,480
the dark web so not it's not only the

336
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,000
dark web so

337
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,839
i'm not saying that there's no dark web

338
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,240
or deep web or whatever you want to call

339
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,279
it

340
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,360
of course a lot of people

341
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,760
or even security vendors use that term

342
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,120
but for our purposes we'll use the term

343
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,040
uh criminal underground which i think is

344
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,200
more appropriate because it's not just

345
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,600
on those parts of the internet where

346
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,079
criminal

347
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,639
operations or cyber crime is happening

348
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,800
so

349
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,600
i think i'll have some disclaimer first

350
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,760
before i continue so

351
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,680
this stuff is not about it's not a

352
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,399
household like not how to do it so i

353
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,440
think

354
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,680
uh

355
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,600
yeah there there's there was a talk last

356
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,720
year from

357
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,160
asg scorpion also here in root con which

358
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,639
tackles that so it gives pointers and

359
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,560
how you can do it but

360
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,440
uh

361
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,800
also i'm not

362
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,639
encouraging you to do to do it on your

363
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,880
own like right away so maybe you should

364
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,800
consult someone who

365
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,360
know better uh because of several

366
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,040
reasons maybe it's against your

367
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,079
organization's policy or maybe uh

368
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,240
it's against your moral but because you

369
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,120
know

370
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,079
uh

371
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,440
you don't know what

372
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,480
you'll encounter maybe so yeah

373
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,000
so

374
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,079
oh by the way the title of this talk is

375
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,240
i think automating threat hunting on the

376
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,160
dark web so you you should check that

377
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,199
out if you're interested more on the uh

378
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,959
how to do it so instead this uh talk uh

379
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,920
focuses more on some of the use cases

380
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,760
for intelligence coming from the

381
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,800
criminal underground so let's say uh

382
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,360
what's actually out there and how you

383
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,800
can use that

384
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,600
uh

385
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,880
to better

386
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,720
to have insights to protect your

387
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,480
organization so

388
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,040
uh this talk will include some research

389
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,440
we have done uh from

390
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,480
uh so some time ago and of course some

391
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,480
ongoing ones still

392
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,560
so let's

393
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,399
move on i think

394
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,079
so with that

395
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,320
being said we can say that cyber crime

396
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,600
underground is equals to the operational

397
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,760
environment for cyber criminals so this

398
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,959
is where they uh do their thing

399
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,040
so this is also

400
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,920
uh a place where we can engage them so

401
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,760
yeah as i mentioned earlier it could

402
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,320
include forums maybe

403
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,440
uh chat platforms maybe even facebook

404
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,160
groups so or any other place where they

405
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,680
operate so

406
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,079
also we can say that this is uh

407
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,279
place where financially motivated

408
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,600
uh threat actors operate

409
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,920
most of the time but

410
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,079
uh also

411
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,720
there's uh

412
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,680
like

413
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,240
there are also some like nation-state

414
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,440
sponsored uh actors uh

415
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,680
working there but probably

416
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,880
uh very loki also of course there are

417
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,519
uh security researchers and law

418
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,399
enforcement there so but that that does

419
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,480
not necessarily mean that we are cyber

420
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,959
criminals as well so yeah that's

421
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,560
your cyber crime underground

422
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,360
oh by the way uh before we move on to

423
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,680
the use cases it's also good to point

424
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,000
out at this point that there's actually

425
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,759
no single or

426
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,639
unified cyber crime underground

427
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,959
like of course there's the russian

428
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,720
speaking ones but

429
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,959
other regions tend to have their own

430
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,839
uh flavor of cyber crime like for

431
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:26,959
example

432
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,000
uh

433
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,759
of course the russian-speaking ones are

434
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,800
like more about malware

435
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,440
getting access of course our ransomware

436
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,240
but say if you check out some other

437
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,560
rejoins like for example in brazil

438
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,758
they're all about

439
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,720
banking trojans for example and let's

440
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,560
say here in the philippines i think we

441
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,399
have our stamas

442
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,880
so there are more on like the fraud

443
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,000
stuff

444
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,920
so yeah

445
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,360
so moving on

446
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,160
let's have our first use case which are

447
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,439
credentials and dumps

448
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:06,150
so

449
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,520
[Music]

450
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,679
of course we all know that there's a lot

451
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,880
of uh like leaks or yeah data leaks

452
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,480
being shared

453
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,799
so we're going to have a look at some of

454
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,799
them here and then

455
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,640
let's see what

456
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,199
we can learn from them

457
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,359
so first would be that facebook dump

458
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,760
this was like this year early this year

459
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,840
yeah april so yeah april

460
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,760
uh so these are actually not necessarily

461
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,240
stolen credentials or

462
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,120
like

463
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,600
uh yeah it's no way stolen it's more

464
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,559
like they are scraped data from facebook

465
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,440
but

466
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,600
uh

467
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,640
it includes uh several piis which can

468
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,360
identify persons so

469
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,360
let's take a look at how the data looks

470
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,520
like so for this one we try to analyze

471
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,760
uh data for the philippines only so i

472
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,880
think there's around less than a million

473
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,840
but yeah this is how it looks

474
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,840
so basically you have all your you have

475
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,960
your phone number your

476
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,520
fb id then full name

477
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,080
address and then other information like

478
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,799
where uh to give so

479
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,360
definitely you know uh how bad guys

480
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,450
could use this like they can

481
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,280
[Music]

482
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,400
try to

483
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,360
uh

484
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,600
of course identity theft and

485
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,520
maybe some other malicious stuff

486
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,039
so

487
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,240
some

488
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,240
fun statistics we

489
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,960
get from that down so yeah i'm just

490
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,280
trying to make it a little bit fun

491
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,080
so

492
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,400
we have this

493
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,600
so what we did is we parsed the data and

494
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,600
took the

495
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,640
uh

496
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,200
employee or like where you work

497
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,919
so apparently there's a lot of uh

498
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,720
filipino on facebook who works with

499
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,080
spongebob

500
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,919
on the classic ram

501
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:06,799
so

502
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,640
yeah it's quite funny

503
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,760
so for we have like others here facebook

504
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,440
and then this one is also quite funny

505
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,200
so a lot of people watch there

506
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,679
apparently so yeah you have that for

507
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,000
some stats from that uh

508
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,120
uh

509
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,400
leak

510
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,400
but yeah that's fun but seriously

511
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,600
this is

512
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,280
this screenshot is from

513
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,640
a store

514
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,360
in the underground

515
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,679
where they actually sell facebook data

516
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,240
so this is like per piece the price is

517
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,480
like less than two dollars but yeah so

518
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,400
that you can get information that

519
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,840
you want maybe

520
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,000
of course this this shops usually have a

521
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,720
way to filter like or search for example

522
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,559
you want to get a

523
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,480
uh account an account from the

524
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,640
philippines so you can do that and then

525
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,520
you can just buy it yeah using like

526
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,480
your choice of crypto

527
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,360
and another one

528
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,520
so this one

529
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,679
zero day bridge uh

530
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,720
this is quite uh big in itself

531
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,280
uh sid zero day is actually another

532
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,080
forum underground forum where they share

533
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,240
this kind of stuff like which databases

534
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,120
actually so some hacker would

535
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,000
get

536
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,360
or dump

537
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,200
let's say your database and they would

538
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,600
put it in this uh

539
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,799
forum

540
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,720
and unfortunately that forum was

541
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,520
breached by some other hacker and sell

542
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,520
it in another forum so

543
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,640
it's here

544
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,480
it's like around 9 000 databases they

545
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,360
sell so for this one so i choose this

546
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,400
one so this is no way the biggest bump

547
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,520
or

548
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,679
uh the most relevant one i just choose

549
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,080
this one because it's easy to identify

550
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,320
uh

551
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,799
credentials or accounts coming from the

552
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,039
philippines because what what i did here

553
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,440
is uh

554
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,280
we extracted those databases coming from

555
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,600
domains with that ph

556
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,520
so we have it here so it's around like

557
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,760
30 to 40 organizations

558
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,600
but uh

559
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,520
of course these are

560
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,760
bridged organizations not necessarily

561
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,039
or services so it's not necessarily

562
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,480
necessarily the organization

563
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,520
uh itself was bridge so looking here at

564
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,480
this graph it's like uh credentials from

565
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,039
that from that set of data from that

566
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,520
data set so we have these organizations

567
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,360
i try to uh

568
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,679
reduct the names because

569
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,559
obviously uh i'm not sure if these

570
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,559
organizations are aware that

571
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,720
uh they have their credentials out there

572
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,520
so

573
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,000
these dumps are usually uh

574
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,720
combos so it's like username and

575
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,240
password or email and password or

576
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,120
in some like not very bad cases

577
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,360
the password is

578
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,520
instead of a password you have a hash

579
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,760
but yeah so

580
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,559
we have this stats so we have this

581
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,240
organization i think this one and this

582
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,240
one are the same

583
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,320
so i just did not bother to join them

584
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,200
together so this one

585
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,360
so quite a lot here

586
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,280
uh

587
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,600
the thing here as i mentioned earlier it

588
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,400
it does not necessarily mean that uh

589
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,799
this organization with this

590
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,360
with this uh domains

591
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,520
are the actual or

592
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,960
they are not

593
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,720
they are not necessarily the ones who

594
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,880
are bridged so it's the service that

595
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,360
their users are using which are bridged

596
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,320
and then

597
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,559
it just happened that they're using

598
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,960
their probably corporate email for

599
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,039
signing up on those services so that's

600
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,440
why this happened

601
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,120
so same with this one this is for

602
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,840
educational institutions

603
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,960
so

604
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,360
again as i say said earlier this does

605
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,799
not actually mean uh that this are these

606
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,200
organizations or these uh institutions

607
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,320
are breached

608
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,280
so they have uh probably their students

609
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,600
are using uh this email addresses to

610
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,720
sign up to somewhere like

611
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,679
i think one of the breaches on this on

612
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,159
this dump is from wattpad i know that

613
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,960
for a fact that a lot of filipinos are

614
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,760
uh

615
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,360
signing up

616
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,159
on

617
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,880
wattpad so maybe that's how

618
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,280
it happened so but yeah this is just to

619
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,960
show you the stats for these

620
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,200
institutions

621
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,960
and then from government agencies as

622
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,760
well

623
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,840
so we have here

624
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,799
several credentials from that dump it's

625
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,120
like not the entirety of dump but a data

626
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,120
set from that dump only

627
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,600
so we have that and then

628
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,440
yeah unfortunately also from our

629
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,440
military organizations so we have here

630
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,080
from afp yes g-army

631
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,520
af

632
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,640
so

633
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,960
there's just a few so that's good but

634
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,440
still yeah it's out there so

635
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,679
i actually i think we reported this to

636
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:10,960
them so

637
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,260
uh

638
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,640
[Music]

639
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,320
as i've said earlier it does not

640
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,520
necessarily mean that they are

641
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,080
compromised so some of their users or

642
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,240
those who use email addresses with these

643
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,000
domains

644
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,679
use it to sign up to a compromised

645
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,720
service so with that

646
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,440
i think so what's uh what can we do with

647
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,880
this so

648
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,480
with that i think

649
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,919
uh

650
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,039
first

651
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,480
is

652
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,400
yeah maybe tell these guys to reset

653
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
their passwords that's the

654
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,720
one good thing to do but of course more

655
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,120
importantly is to educate them or to

656
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,880
have like uh

657
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,559
an awareness for

658
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,360
uh proper like password hygiene like you

659
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,960
don't use your

660
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,000
your

661
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,360
passwords

662
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,760
or even accounts email accounts to sign

663
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,279
up this uh external services so also

664
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,440
in terms of the organization they should

665
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,360
have

666
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,320
i think

667
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,880
stricter policies regarding the use of

668
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,940
email

669
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,279
[Music]

670
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,640
without with other services

671
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,720
so we have that

672
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,559
and

673
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,279
yeah still part of the dumps i just want

674
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,840
to showcase this uh market from the

675
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,360
underground it's called the genesis

676
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,679
store or genesis market so basically

677
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,440
this sells you uh fingerprints or

678
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,120
like uh i think yeah so

679
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,279
when you're trying to use this stolen

680
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,679
credential so let's say

681
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:44,720
i'm a

682
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,559
threat actor i wanted to use this

683
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,400
credentials so usually so let's say

684
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,760
okay let's just say i want to use my

685
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,080
google account in another computer let's

686
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,720
say i'm also somewhere else or maybe i'm

687
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,000
using a vpn so i've tried to log into my

688
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,760
gmail account and then

689
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,679
you know google would

690
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,960
be all suspicious about your activities

691
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,080
so

692
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,120
this apparently the the stuff they sell

693
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,840
here is they try to prevent that because

694
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,279
these are stored this historic

695
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,640
credentials

696
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,440
uh includes all the stuff you need so

697
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,640
that

698
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,480
when you use this

699
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,640
credentials it would appear

700
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,640
as if you're using it like you're the

701
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,440
actual user of that uh

702
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,400
uh

703
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,159
credentials so how did they do that so

704
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,240
they have fingerprints so all the

705
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,360
cookies and everything they also provide

706
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,799
this uh software called genesis security

707
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,559
which would also

708
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,200
automatically use a proxy where that

709
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,240
data is supposed to be coming from so

710
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,600
this software though i have not actually

711
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,400
get my hand on it i think it's like a

712
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,440
custom

713
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,559
browser probably they build their own

714
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:03,679
chrome

715
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,520
browser

716
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,360
to have all these features

717
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,600
well also based on the description they

718
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,639
have there so

719
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,440
yeah it sets everything up for the user

720
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,880
so it makes it very easy for

721
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,720
for other criminals even if you don't

722
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,720
have any experience you don't have to

723
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,600
bother with uh vpns you don't have to

724
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,440
bother with

725
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,000
your cookies so you just

726
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,360
use it for

727
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,919
you buy it and then use it for whatever

728
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:34,960
purpose

729
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,159
you want to use it for so these are some

730
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,760
of the

731
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,559
uh credentials for sale for example and

732
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,120
yeah it's of course it's not available

733
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,640
uh features of

734
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,080
this stores usually you can search them

735
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,240
you can filter your search so if for

736
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,679
example you want

737
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,440
accounts coming from the philippines so

738
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,600
you can just filter it here you can

739
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,480
filter with according to price as well

740
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,440
you can

741
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,080
filter you can search for specific

742
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,799
accounts you want so maybe you want a

743
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,440
facebook account a netflix account so

744
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,679
you can do that uh in the interface it's

745
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:12,880
quite common

746
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,600
uh with the

747
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,360
stores and shops on the underground so

748
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,760
yeah we have that for the genesis market

749
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,320
and then next uh we'll have uh dump

750
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,440
shops and installed in stolen

751
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,440
credit cards so this is our second

752
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,000
use case

753
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,600
so this is how

754
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,000
a force look like

755
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,679
so a fools so it's like a islam in the

756
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,880
fraud community so basically it's like

757
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,320
it stands for full information

758
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,679
so

759
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,880
in this case this came from a recent

760
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,799
leak which is actually shared for free

761
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,480
like i think it's

762
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,440
i'm not

763
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,440
i can't remember if it's a million

764
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,000
records but they share it for free

765
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,480
and i just filtered it so that

766
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,120
uh we just analyzed those coming from

767
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,399
the philippines

768
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,240
so

769
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,399
it includes the the card number the

770
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,640
credit card number the expiration date

771
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,200
and the cvv so sometimes that's that's

772
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,080
enough

773
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,360
but yeah it also includes uh like the

774
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,480
full information

775
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,200
like your name your address

776
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,520
some of them have their phone numbers in

777
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,159
it so yeah uh

778
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,360
this

779
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,640
came from

780
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,320
a rather recent uh but yeah i haven't

781
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,559
confirmed if this are actually like

782
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:43,840
working or

783
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,080
new

784
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,000
so did so where

785
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,039
do that

786
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,000
where

787
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,640
do this uh

788
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,799
dumps go

789
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:55,919
is

790
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:56,720
this

791
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,799
dump shops

792
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,360
so this is quite popular this one bryce

793
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,279
club these days this is i think one of

794
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,960
the most popular one

795
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,679
so bryce i'll just show you screenshots

796
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,240
of the dump shops but yeah i'll just

797
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,840
make it to it

798
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,520
so this is another one

799
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,600
so they're quite artistically with all

800
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,799
the

801
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,559
stuff they

802
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,440
they have but i'm not going to show you

803
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,760
everything like how it looks inside

804
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,520
because they're basically almost the

805
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,120
same i'll just show you

806
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,919
uh

807
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,520
one at the end which is uh yeah where we

808
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,399
did most most of our analysis

809
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,480
so these are like

810
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,520
uh

811
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,760
the dump shops and then we have here so

812
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,480
this is the driver stash

813
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,760
so

814
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,720
yeah

815
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,320
so this is where we

816
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,080
this is the dump shop that we analyzed

817
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,919
so

818
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,640
fortunately this one is already

819
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,840
uh

820
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,399
they already closed shop so they're not

821
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,320
operational anymore

822
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,960
so that's good

823
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,360
but yeah uh before

824
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,360
they close down we are monitoring them

825
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,120
and this is uh the rest of this uh part

826
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,880
we'll discuss

827
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,799
so this is how it looks like inside so

828
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,679
usually all those thumb shots even the

829
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,080
others that i've showed you the

830
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,080
the

831
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,880
uh login screen so when you log in there

832
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,360
there would be a new section so the new

833
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,440
section is where they put

834
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,120
all the stuff regarding

835
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,000
added dumps on their website or what

836
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,720
they call in this case basis

837
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,440
so

838
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,960
we have that

839
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,880
so take note of this because we use this

840
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,760
in our analysis later

841
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,919
and then this is actually the actual

842
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,720
part where you can buy

843
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,600
the actual cards

844
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,480
so you have here bin numbers countries

845
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,039
so you can search and sort it out

846
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,120
according to these fields

847
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,720
and actually this store is also

848
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,799
like

849
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,360
they have like an auto buy option like

850
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,480
it's automatic because obviously

851
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,919
the fresher the cars are so the more

852
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,640
useful it is for them so some of the

853
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,200
threat offers just put their

854
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,559
deposit

855
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,720
some credits here on this shop and then

856
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,159
they set some filters and automatically

857
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,840
when new dumps

858
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,880
would be added to the shop it will be

859
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,480
automatically

860
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,360
bought for them so you have it here

861
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,559
you can of course

862
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,640
check them out manually

863
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,559
as well

864
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,918
so we have that

865
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,480
so this is the information or the data

866
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,640
we collected from that shop so basically

867
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,760
what we did here is we try to scrape all

868
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,440
this data

869
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,190
coming from the shop

870
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:04,369
[Music]

871
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,480
this is

872
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,760
i yeah

873
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,960
this is data from 2019

874
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,640
also this is no way

875
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,559
this is in no way a complete

876
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,559
representation of the data available on

877
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,039
that shop during that time because

878
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,399
of several limitations

879
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,600
but this is like a good part of uh

880
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,320
what's out there so we'll know at least

881
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,640
we have an idea of what's being sold out

882
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,200
there and of course this data you don't

883
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,000
have

884
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,519
like the fools

885
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,480
or the full information so mostly it's

886
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,279
just preview of what's out there so

887
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,240
yeah

888
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,440
let's

889
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,840
go let's continue with this

890
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,679
so

891
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,480
oh another limitation

892
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,559
we encountered when doing this research

893
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,080
is that there's a lot of uh

894
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,200
limits on how you can search

895
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,960
or

896
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,720
how many pages

897
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,560
can be rendered for a specific base so i

898
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,440
think it's like around probably 47 or

899
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,918
something after that even if there are

900
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,399
more data you won't be able to get it so

901
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,440
that kind of limitation also

902
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,639
this is i'll say

903
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,119
uh not very

904
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,679
easy to scrape because of

905
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,800
several

906
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,000
uh like security mechanisms they put

907
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,839
mostly like captchas so it's kind of

908
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,918
hard to automate

909
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:36,960
some stuff

910
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,918
for scraping this data

911
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:40,639
so

912
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,040
with that

913
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,800
this is like a breakdown of uh

914
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,320
the volume for 2019 so per month

915
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,040
so as i've said this is probably not

916
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,680
reflective of what's happening in that

917
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,560
shop during that time so this are

918
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,760
because uh uh it also

919
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,920
it depends on a lot of uh

920
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,960
factors so

921
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,000
yeah it's a good representation but

922
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,599
probably not uh very accurate i would

923
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,960
say

924
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,200
but if you can see here

925
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,200
you'll notice a friend with a

926
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,078
average price

927
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,280
so around september the value of the

928
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,640
card starts

929
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,520
going up

930
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,800
so yeah maybe christmas starts early on

931
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,960
that dump shop just like we do here in

932
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,640
the philippines

933
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,320
so with that

934
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,599
let's move to

935
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,599
the bridges so earlier i've shown you

936
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,200
like the new section and they announced

937
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,280
the breaches there so that's how we

938
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,800
parse the data

939
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,800
so

940
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,280
uh the the cards

941
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,040
on that shop

942
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,480
are either

943
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,119
skimmed or

944
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:01,440
maybe it came from a bridge so just

945
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,599
those two classifications well based at

946
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,520
least from the description of the

947
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,040
of the bases

948
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,160
so

949
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,119
for

950
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,119
the whole entirety of the data that we

951
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,440
collected

952
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,640
75 of

953
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,560
those data came from

954
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,079
scheming so we're not exactly sure

955
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:20,880
uh

956
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,079
what kind of scheming probably uh

957
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,760
using uh cos malware or maybe a skimming

958
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,680
device or probably also using web uh

959
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,359
web-based schemers

960
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,320
so

961
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,359
but yeah

962
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,480
it's a good 75 of the total data and the

963
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,720
rest the 25

964
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,359
falls under the bridges so we try to

965
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,920
break down the bridges into

966
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,119
into their uh name to their

967
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:51,200
uh

968
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,760
base name so we have this so we have

969
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,720
that so yeah they're also quite creative

970
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,920
with how they name their uh

971
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,160
uh bases or dumps so we have that

972
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,440
davinci solar energy nwo

973
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,760
theory so yeah so you have that

974
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,560
and

975
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,560
good thing about this is during our

976
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,839
research we were all we were also

977
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,520
able well by correlating news uh

978
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,680
from the open sources we were able to

979
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,760
correlate that uh

980
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,839
this bridges from this dump shop

981
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,000
actually represents

982
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,720
a bridge or a known bridge so in this

983
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,240
case davinci

984
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,960
is actually from early enterprises and

985
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,119
then solar energy is from this one and

986
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,079
this one is from this one so yeah that's

987
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,520
uh some insights you can get from

988
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:43,870
uh

989
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,119
[Music]

990
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,599
monitoring or analyzing those

991
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,800
dump shops

992
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,119
just for

993
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,480
other

994
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,240
stuff so yeah

995
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,839
so this is not

996
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,079
very much considering the amount of data

997
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,200
that

998
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,520
that we collected like around

999
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,839
2.8 million there's a few from the

1000
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,839
philippines not very much which is i

1001
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,240
i'll say good like around probably 3 000

1002
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,839
only

1003
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:13,760
so that's good there's not very much but

1004
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,920
still i think this is significant

1005
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,960
also

1006
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,400
considering that the average price

1007
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,560
for cards from the philippines are

1008
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,700
actually relatively high so cars usually

1009
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,240
[Music]

1010
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,400
the average for price

1011
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,359
during this time so it it

1012
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,480
changes uh depending on

1013
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,280
uh

1014
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,280
let's say season so

1015
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,000
so during this time 2019

1016
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,800
so this is the price of

1017
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,599
for philippine banks so we have here

1018
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:48,720
bank a

1019
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,119
these are numbers of cards

1020
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,680
from our data set

1021
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,560
so

1022
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,359
bank b so we have this so we did not

1023
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,520
bother to put the names some of this i

1024
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,839
think we reported to the banks but yeah

1025
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,040
these are

1026
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,839
uh

1027
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,280
but they can

1028
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,200
i'm not sure how they can deal with this

1029
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,280
but at least they know that yeah they

1030
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,079
are

1031
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,160
it's out there their

1032
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,800
their data is being sold though yeah we

1033
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,599
don't

1034
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,599
have the full like card number for

1035
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,680
example so that they can block that so

1036
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,839
unfortunately uh

1037
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,560
that those uh dump shops don't provide

1038
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,720
that well unless you have access to the

1039
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,359
actual back end so unfortunately in our

1040
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:30,720
case we just have

1041
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,880
this data coming from their front end

1042
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,839
so as i've said

1043
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,920
some good news so they are finally

1044
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,599
closed so

1045
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,160
yeah probably they earned a lot already

1046
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,960
so that's why they closed or maybe

1047
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,920
they moved to another

1048
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,560
like business model maybe they moved to

1049
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,200
run somewhere so that's our third use

1050
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,439
case

1051
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,800
so of course we we all know that there

1052
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,800
has been a rise of ransomware attacks in

1053
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,400
the past few years

1054
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,760
and for

1055
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,760
some time already

1056
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,839
their models of randy kind of change

1057
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,720
like they try to

1058
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,319
get or exfiltrate your data and put it

1059
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,400
into their league site so

1060
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,040
with this part what we did is

1061
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,520
we check so

1062
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,560
we check all these leak sites and try to

1063
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,280
gain inform intelligence from those next

1064
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,440
sites so this is like a page from the

1065
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,800
onion as well

1066
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,800
or you can see all the links for their

1067
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,880
leak sites

1068
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,280
even the earnings

1069
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,920
for some of them but yeah this is where

1070
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,319
we focus the links and then from there

1071
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:49,040
we get the list of the victims and then

1072
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,960
we try to correlate them

1073
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,920
uh say according to their industry or

1074
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,200
sec force

1075
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,680
yeah or vertical where they would belong

1076
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,640
or which country they are in and then we

1077
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,920
try to uh have some stats for that so

1078
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,520
first let's have

1079
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,920
uh the top 10 ransomware groups well

1080
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,319
this is according to their victims so

1081
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,240
from the data we collected

1082
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,040
so

1083
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,720
top one is conti

1084
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,319
of course i know

1085
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,400
you're familiar with some of this it's

1086
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,560
like all over the news recently so we

1087
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,760
have quantity

1088
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,480
lucky avadon reveal

1089
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,720
and so on so these are like the top ones

1090
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,480
and then

1091
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,760
target

1092
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,440
top 10 target

1093
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,359
15

1094
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,119
sectors or

1095
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,640
on verticals

1096
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,520
so we have industrials consumer so some

1097
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,200
of them would claim

1098
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,800
that they don't target health care but

1099
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,880
apparently there's still health care

1100
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,560
here so yeah

1101
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,359
and if you see the least we're not able

1102
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,079
to put a

1103
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,079
a sector for everything because

1104
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,599
sometimes you don't

1105
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,880
have that information but for those with

1106
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,280
uh we have information so we try to

1107
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,319
group this

1108
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:07,520
group them into this

1109
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,079
and then distribution by continent so

1110
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,359
obviously north america so mostly united

1111
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:14,839
states have

1112
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:16,720
uh

1113
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,359
the most attacks or most victims

1114
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,680
europe as well so this we were not able

1115
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,880
to figure out which

1116
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,599
continent they belong also this unknown

1117
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:28,560
but

1118
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,440
there's

1119
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,599
40 in asia

1120
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:32,960
so

1121
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,040
what are the chances that

1122
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,079
there are victims here in the

1123
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,160
philippines so are there

1124
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,319
so unfortunately based from

1125
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,560
the leg side themselves

1126
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,800
yep there are

1127
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,200
victims of ransomware so this is from

1128
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,760
the everest ransomware div site

1129
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,560
so

1130
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,760
apparently the department of agriculture

1131
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,680
was

1132
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,119
ransomware somewhere i think uh around

1133
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,160
june

1134
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,400
also this one

1135
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,760
so

1136
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,400
though the data is not yet available so

1137
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,000
that means they're not leaking it so i'm

1138
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,760
not sure maybe they forgot about i don't

1139
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,480
know

1140
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,440
so

1141
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,440
also this one this

1142
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,560
uh

1143
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,000
company from makati city

1144
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,040
they also have

1145
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,520
data of this already there

1146
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,480
so

1147
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,319
yeah these are like more

1148
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:33,599
ids passport scans so kyc basically

1149
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,319
and of course we have this from luck

1150
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,960
beat so this is uh before

1151
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,640
uh

1152
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,160
before the luck beat gun uh

1153
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,599
decided to

1154
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,480
hide i'll say so they have this on their

1155
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,440
dick site so it's for uh

1156
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,880
an auto

1157
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,880
insurance company i think

1158
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,640
i remember correctly

1159
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,200
and then and so this this one is from

1160
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,920
luck beat and this one is from

1161
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,240
uh lawrence ransomware

1162
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,359
so

1163
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,040
another government

1164
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,640
agency so bcda so their data is already

1165
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,079
published

1166
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,720
apparently 90 already so probably their

1167
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,400
sister part four

1168
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,520
so yeah

1169
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,480
you have that published there

1170
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,480
so

1171
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:30,160
of course in terms of ransomware uh

1172
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,560
being there

1173
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,839
like if you see your organization in

1174
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,200
in

1175
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,040
those league sites so that's not a good

1176
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,280
sign so it's like game over already so

1177
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,800
that means you're bridged

1178
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,119
but also

1179
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:45,920
uh

1180
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,760
i think we can learn a lot of stuff from

1181
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,640
there

1182
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,359
like for government agencies for example

1183
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:55,119
so maybe this will give you insights on

1184
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,240
of your potential exposure uh

1185
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,280
maybe you're running the same system as

1186
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,400
those

1187
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,280
uh

1188
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,520
who are compromised or maybe

1189
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,839
uh you're actually in the same infra or

1190
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:10,319
maybe the same people

1191
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:11,599
work on

1192
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,000
this infrastructures or

1193
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,119
they manage your ict so yeah you can

1194
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:18,560
definitely

1195
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,759
get some lessons there

1196
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:26,960
this will also give you like uh

1197
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,599
like insights of what are the needed

1198
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,520
intelligence to know

1199
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,520
so that you know what to look for in

1200
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,319
your

1201
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,560
environment so that's very

1202
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,680
that will still be very helpful so even

1203
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,319
given the fact now that

1204
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:45,359
someone is already

1205
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,720
compromised

1206
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,720
so same with other organizations so you

1207
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,319
can check oh maybe

1208
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:51,760
this this

1209
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,560
corporation or this organization are

1210
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,240
running these servers that's why they're

1211
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,480
compromised or maybe

1212
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,119
sometimes uh this uh campaigns are

1213
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:03,359
thematic i'll say

1214
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:04,160
uh

1215
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,240
they target like specific set force so

1216
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,079
you know that if you'll see that oh

1217
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:09,520
there's a rise

1218
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,800
uh with

1219
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,440
victims from this sector so should i be

1220
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,359
worried so if you're on that sector so

1221
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:17,200
yeah probably you should be

1222
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,280
so yeah there's a lot of information you

1223
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,079
can

1224
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,040
uh get from uh those stuff

1225
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,920
so as a summary so this are like this so

1226
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,640
those are like uh

1227
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,079
the research we

1228
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,400
did but there's a lot of other stuff out

1229
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,800
there so these are common threat

1230
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,359
intelligence use cases from the

1231
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:40,720
cyber crime underground so we can use it

1232
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,040
for brand monitoring so

1233
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,960
include slick data

1234
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,680
compromise credential

1235
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,400
executive and vip protection like maybe

1236
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,720
your

1237
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,800
like higher ups or c switch information

1238
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,160
was published somewhere so

1239
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,400
you know it's very common that

1240
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,640
uh

1241
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,280
they use that for fraud or for identity

1242
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,400
theft and then of course you can

1243
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,640
use this for fraud intelligence

1244
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,480
or investigations

1245
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,839
so there's also a lot of uh

1246
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:21,920
let's say discussions about

1247
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,440
malware like development rentals so

1248
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,559
whatever

1249
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:29,040
also vulnerabilities and

1250
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,000
exploits so that's discussed a lot

1251
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,480
in those

1252
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,640
forums

1253
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,640
also

1254
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,079
can be into geopolitical threats like

1255
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,359
uh

1256
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,160
can

1257
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,319
there could be like some

1258
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:47,839
some

1259
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:49,760
groups discussing

1260
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,400
terrorism and some extremist activities

1261
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,359
that this is uh usually

1262
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,119
well based from my experience would

1263
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,040
usually be found on

1264
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,079
telegram there's quite a there's quite a

1265
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,160
lot of

1266
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,040
groups

1267
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,280
that discuss this kind of stuff so yeah

1268
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,839
it's it's out there so maybe

1269
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,920
this applies to your organization so

1270
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,160
maybe you need this so maybe you should

1271
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,640
consider uh getting

1272
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,440
uh

1273
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,760
threat intel as well from

1274
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,319
the cyber criminal underground

1275
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:23,359
so

1276
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:24,880
i guess with that

1277
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,960
if you have any questions you can email

1278
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,400
me so i think that concludes my uh

1279
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,000
presentation so if you have questions

1280
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,839
you can email me here this is my email

1281
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,760

and have the plan
