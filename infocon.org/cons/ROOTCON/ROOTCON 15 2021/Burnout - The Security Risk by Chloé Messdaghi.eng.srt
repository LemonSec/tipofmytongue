you uh welcome to infosec a broken

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,120
industry that keeps it insecure and

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,519
risky and i'm very excited to talk about

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,599
this because it's something close to my

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,320
heart about burnout but also i get to

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,960
touch about how our industry could

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,359
really use some help right now on making

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,439
things better for everyone

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,599
on how to reduce burnout and i just want

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,320
to say that this talk is just just

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,440
really putting out there that burnout is

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,559
not

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,760
caused by you it's not about self-care

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,120
anymore it is about how we are

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,360
in this certain system that we are

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,480
placed in

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,960
and how it keeps causing us to get

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,640
burned out which i'm going to touch on

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,879

42
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,799
now let's get into the real reason why

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,759
you're here today

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,240
i just want to say that you may be here

45
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,680
right now

46
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,399
let's be honest with one another

47
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,920
the pandemic

48
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,040
there was no guide on how to survive it

49
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,240
and we're still in a pandemic

50
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,520
and we are on a fine line of just being

51
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,560
okay

52
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,040
and not being okay

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,960
and we've been dealing with burnout even

54
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,919
before the pandemic within our industry

55
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,680
so that's why it's important for us to

56
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,000
talk about this because even if when the

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,480
pandemic is over we still have to

58
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,720
address this

59
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,760
with burnout we do place ourselves an

60
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,640
organization at a security risk we're

61
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,440
more likely to click on a link

62
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,319
because we're not 100 who we are because

63
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,280
our

64
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,920
we are not a full completely charged

65
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,519
battery in a sense so we're going to

66
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,840
make a lot more mistakes

67
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,560
we may not even patch correctly we may

68
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,879
be overwhelmed of what is needed to be

69
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,319
patched but also let's be real

70
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,280
sometimes us being insecurity

71
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,599
people see us as kind of like robots and

72
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,000
not humans um and this is one of the

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,560
things is that within security itself

74
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,840
we're expected to work 24 7 and always

75
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,319
be at the edge of our seat 24 7

76
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,280
because that is what's expected of us is

77
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,080
to work all hours and be expected to be

78
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,599
on calls at all hours because security

79
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,080
is 24 7.

80
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,040
so

81
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,879
at the end of the day is how do you even

82
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,360
balance a personal life and work life

83
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,680
because the reality is is that if we're

84
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,319
not balancing our work and personal life

85
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,440
that's when we start having burnout

86
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,319
because that balance is gone

87
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,959
so you may even see signs of it such as

88
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:33,840
like

89
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,120
um

90
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,000
you've

91
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,159
noticed changes with your colleagues

92
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,560
even with yourself uh they

93
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,040
may be withdrawn or fast to become angry

94
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,239
and sad

95
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,200
uh you might see delay and responses or

96
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,959
projects and this could be seen remote

97
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,400
too you don't have to actually be in

98
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,239
person to know if someone's burned out

99
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,280
or not

100
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,959
but this is the thing is to understand

101
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,840
is that since we've been remote

102
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,599
um and also since we've been working

103
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,680
from home and the pandemic the thing is

104
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,200
is that it's incredibly hard to put a

105
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,080
line in the sand saying this is my work

106
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,799
time this is my personal time and

107
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,480
putting boundaries down

108
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,120
because it's almost impossible in the

109
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,519
past to have boundaries when you work in

110
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,798
security

111
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,959
but the thing is is that i think at this

112
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,918
point

113
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,600
we are starting to realize if we don't

114
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,600
put down boundaries when we're not

115
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,680
practicing more balancing of work and

116
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,280
personal life

117
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,680
we end up getting burned out and the

118
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,240
effects can be really bad

119
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,479
and for those that aren't aware of how

120
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,639
bad burnout can start forming and

121
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,919
looking like

122
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,320
it used to be that it took a few minutes

123
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,120
to respond to an email now it takes

124
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,560
hours or days you may feel exhausted and

125
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,520
trapped

126
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,400
you might even feel empty you may push

127
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,720
yourself to like this breaking point and

128
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,479
it's almost impossible to come up with

129
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,199
new ideas or new strategies and then you

130
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,759
start getting some aches here and there

131
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,400
as well um you get overly anxious over

132
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,360
events and deadlines you can get angry

133
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,800
or you can get sad very fast and the

134
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,280
other thing is that you may even

135
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,759
not respond to your friends and family

136
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,080
at you know at a certain time not

137
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,120
because you're busy it's because

138
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,400
you're worried that that's gonna be

139
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,560
another task on top of everything and

140
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,160
that's when you start having this guilt

141
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,520
that comes in

142
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,199
and when that guilt starts coming in

143
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,960
it's reminding you that your personal

144
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,720
life is now slipping your work has

145
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,639
become your life

146
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,280
and then when your life is your work you

147
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,600
start feeling under appreciated for

148
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,000
everything that you have given up to be

149
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,639
in that role or where you work

150
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,520
and then you get resentful at your work

151
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,600
now when you get resentful this ends up

152
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,800
being this change of hating and dreading

153
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,039
going to your job this is the moment

154
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,000
that you do lose team members so burnout

155
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,800
is something very very serious

156
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,720
and it's not just that but also when we

157
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,440
don't address burnout this can happen to

158
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,680
your body you're going to feel exhausted

159
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,520
you're going to struggle to sleep you

160
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,160
can you'll start mimicking the same

161
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,319
symptoms as anxiety and depression

162
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,000
you'll start noticing that you get sick

163
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,479
more often your muscles get tight and

164
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,080
sore you might get more headaches

165
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,479
suddenly or

166
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:24,400
gastrointestinal issues as well

167
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,319
and

168
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:28,080
cardiovascular problems increase so this

169
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,680
gives you a higher

170
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,919
chance of

171
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,759
the stress that's been prolonged for too

172
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,639
long so you have high blood pressure and

173
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,960
heart attacks and strokes

174
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,319
because there's too much adrenaline

175
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,479
corsal in your body over an extended

176
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,160
time

177
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,319
so burnout is not a joke it is something

178
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,479
serious and no matter how much you push

179
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,160
it and you don't want to address it the

180
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,120
thing is

181
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,599
it will hit you and when it does it will

182
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,160
hit you hard

183
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,479
so the thing is is why are we burned out

184
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,360
within our industry like i said before

185
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,360
we operate 24 7 around the clock

186
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,800
and even in the middle of night that

187
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,280
means if i get a phone call at two or

188
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,800
three in the morning that means i need

189
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,199
to take that phone call because it's

190
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,039
important because i don't want to put

191
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,400
anyone at risk

192
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,639
and neither do you so that's the thing

193
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,720
it's like we're always around the clock

194
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,199
it's very hard to ever have a moment of

195
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,120
just relaxing or

196
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,400
whether or not

197
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,560
when is the call going to happen that

198
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,479
there's a breach

199
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,639
because the thing is attackers they go

200
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,039
at all hours and we're always knowing

201
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,360
that a breach is going to occur it will

202
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,240
occur eventually we just don't know when

203
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,880
and this is the thing

204
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,039
we're also really scared when there is a

205
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,960
breach because we know that is most

206
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,360
likely going to be an ad hoc style to

207
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,800
fix it

208
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,560
because the reality is according to the

209
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,319
opponent institute while security

210
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,560
response planning is slowly improving

211
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,560
year after year that the vast majority

212
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,479
of organizations

213
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,400
74 of them

214
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,080
reported not having

215
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,039
a any incident response plan or having

216
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,800
an ad hoc plan

217
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,759
when it comes to having a breach

218
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,919
this also means that those that did have

219
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,560
plans in the first place

220
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,879
um they didn't have any time of when

221
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,039
they're going to review or when they

222
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,960
were going to

223
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,479
test them out or revisit them at a date

224
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,039
and this is really scary for us because

225
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,799
well we don't have up-to-date plans

226
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,958
how how are we

227
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,360
it's the the just amount of stress and

228
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,679
weight on our shoulders of

229
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,559
how are we going to deal with this when

230
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,640
this crisis happens so this is why it's

231
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,959
important if we put more attention

232
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,080
towards preparing and prevention we have

233
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,519
a better chance of feeling like we're

234
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,320
we're a little bit less stressed

235
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,959
but this also allows us to know that if

236
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,680
we are burned out and we have a call

237
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,600
saying that there is a breach

238
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,160
we have a procedure that's intact that

239
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,480
we can actually utilize

240
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,519
now the other thing is is that 94 of the

241
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,440
forbes 2000 list still don't have

242
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,040
vulnerability disclosure policies so

243
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,600
this is another hard thing for

244
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,560
uh having security plans is that if you

245
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,920
don't have security strategy that

246
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,880
doesn't incorporate having a bug bounty

247
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,959
program and or a vulnerability

248
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,600
disclosure policies

249
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,800
it is a horrible situation because the

250
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,720
thing is there's too much reliance on a

251
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,519
security team and we need diverse eyes

252
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,080
to find bugs so then

253
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,000
we're able to fix it

254
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,760
but it also is one of those things that

255
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,800
we have to

256
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,839
come

257
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,720
to this point in our industry is that we

258
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,560
need to build a bridge between the

259
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,600
hacker community and the companies

260
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,360
because the reality is if we don't build

261
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,519
that bridge we're going to keep having

262
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,040
these situations and we could have

263
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,519
avoided many breaches

264
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,839
if we had those programs set up

265
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,640
and of course what we tend to do in our

266
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,240
industry is that

267
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,160
we forget about that there's a human

268
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,640
element at play so what we do is we

269
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,720
throw tools hoping that that's going to

270
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,560
fix the situation

271
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,800
um and and what i mean by that is that

272
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,680
right now organizations use more than 45

273
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,920
different security tools

274
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,079
and you don't even know how much you can

275
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,440
trust that

276
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,760
but also usually our incident response

277
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,519
plan coordination

278
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,200
has approximately 19 tools as well now

279
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,920
are those tools updated

280
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,120
how secure are those tools

281
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,880
were there more tools added to them

282
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,200
because remember most of the plans that

283
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,760
we have already don't exist or they're

284
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,560
out of date the other thing is that more

285
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,519
tools

286
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,120
part of the process means that there's

287
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,120
going to be a slower remediation time

288
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,680
and it's going to cost more money

289
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,320
and let me paint a picture of how

290
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,040
stressful this situation is for security

291
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,040
team now

292
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,160
i want you to imagine that you're on

293
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,480
a crew and you're on this cruise ship

294
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,560
and you just found out that your ship is

295
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,560
sinking but you found a little bit late

296
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,920
because you weren't alerted by your

297
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,320
system on time

298
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,399
your customers are bored

299
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,720
and they're trusting you for their

300
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,839
safety now the one thing to remember is

301
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,959
that your team is a bit scared this is a

302
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,640
brand new situation even though they've

303
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,399
practiced multiple times on what to do

304
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,000
in this situation the thing is is that

305
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,760
they're scared because they're suddenly

306
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,839
in the heat of the moment

307
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,000
but the thing to also keep in mind is

308
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,480
that there is this fear

309
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,680
of failing that can paralyze people too

310
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,440
when they're in uh

311
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,120
you know when they're dealing with a

312
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,880
crisis

313
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,440
so the thing to keep in mind here is

314
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,240
that your team your crew is trying their

315
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,320
best to keep everything afloat and to

316
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,000
make sure that everyone is going to be

317
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,279
okay with the ship going down now there

318
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,680
is a catch here your team hasn't really

319
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,519
slept well

320
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,600
they also feel a little seasick so you

321
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,680
could kind of say that they're

322
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,920
kind of processing and operating as if

323
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,560
they have burnout in other words they're

324
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,920
not exactly 100 percent state of mind

325
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,440
and this is something to keep in mind

326
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,120
so now you have the backstory

327
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,519
now i want you to imagine your captain

328
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,240
pulls out the safety binder

329
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,480
to know what is the protocol for this

330
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,920
ship

331
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,200
but unfortunately that binder

332
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,160
that was updated is not on that ship at

333
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,880
all so you're using an old procedure but

334
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,279
have new features to the ship and your

335
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,600
team is burned out in a sense because

336
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,440
they're seasick and they're paralyzed by

337
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,160
the fear of failing are you stressed out

338
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,600
now because this is what it's like

339
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,800
when we deal with bad plans and when the

340
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,040
human element is taken out it leaves you

341
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,639
with a wreckage

342
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,160
literally

343
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,079
the truth is is that bad actors are

344
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,079
everywhere and they tech all hours and

345
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,560
zero days drop often and we constantly

346
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,800
need to be up to date of what bad actors

347
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,200
use this takes time and energy and this

348
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,720
is why we're struggling because we're

349
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,480
part of a crew

350
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,600
but

351
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,680
we don't function well or communicate

352
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,279
well it could become a really scary

353
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,320
situation and the reason is that we are

354
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,680
insecurity

355
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,120
because we know it's incredibly

356
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,440
important to protect one another

357
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,680
and the other thing is to keep in mind

358
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,680
is that we've also come to terms that we

359
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,839
work around the clock and we don't even

360
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,160
have time to practice self-care because

361
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,880
of the demand and the stress of where

362
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,040
what we're doing

363
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,079
so you have to understand when we come

364
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,959
to a place in our career we might be

365
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,600
like what is the point of this

366
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,720
if our employer isn't helping us or our

367
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
industry isn't changing

368
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,040
how are we going to change things in a

369
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,360
sense

370
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,480
and this is why burnout matters is that

371
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,760
if we keep turning to tools and we don't

372
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,000
find the time to digest the human

373
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,600
element of this that is in play

374
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,440
we're never going to be able to get

375
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,360
where we want to go with our security

376
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,639
team and that is the reason why

377
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,199
we also need to rely on the hacker

378
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,680
community because the reality is the

379
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,760
hacker community is going to find the

380
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,959
bugs your security team cannot find

381
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,560
and this is important to note because

382
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,720
it's better to have the hacker committee

383
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,399
find those vulnerabilities than an

384
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,000
attacker to get a hold of that

385
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,399
vulnerability and not report it to you

386
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,720
and take advantage of you you don't want

387
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,480
to breach right none of us want to

388
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,160
breach that's why we're in this in the

389
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,519
first place

390
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,760
and that's why we have to understand

391
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,920
something which is

392
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,480
we cannot overly rely on our security

393
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,839
teams to find all the bugs

394
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,399
because the reality is that your team is

395
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,440
most likely burned out at some point or

396
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,600
at least one person is going to burn out

397
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,720
on your team at all times and so this is

398
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,880
the thing is is that we need to

399
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,399
understand that having vulnerable

400
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,040
disclosure policies and bug bounty

401
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,240
programs are incredibly important to our

402
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,199
strategy when it comes to security

403
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,880
but also

404
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,680
it allows us to

405
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,959
partner with individuals that are trying

406
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,959
to help us in other words

407
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,320
now the thing i want to just say is that

408
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,160
when you do have a bug bounty of honor

409
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,639
really disclosure policies in place it's

410
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,600
so incredibly important that you have

411
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,079
someone who can manage inquiries and

412
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,839
delegate bugs and also can be on top of

413
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,120
communicating and this is why having a

414
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,519
bug bounty program such as hacker one

415
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,480
it's incredibly important to have that

416
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,040
it makes it easier for communicating for

417
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,199
finding and fixing those bugs faster

418
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,519
than ever which does keep you protected

419
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,160
from attackers

420
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,040
now

421
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,360
for the bug bounty hunters that are

422
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,519
listening to this

423
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,320
first of all thank you for doing what

424
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,360
you do

425
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,440
because we need you

426
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,959
at the end of the day we need you even

427
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,240
if organizations don't have

428
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,000
vulnerability disclosure policies or a

429
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,560
bug batting program they will one day

430
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,399
because they will realize

431
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,920
they need you too

432
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,160
we can't always rely on our own team we

433
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,480
have to get outside help

434
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,480
now the thing i can tell

435
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,800
from your perspective is that the

436
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,399
reality is that

437
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,040
we can put in so many hours to find bugs

438
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,639
and there comes no point where we don't

439
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,880
find things for weeks and months and

440
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,959
this can be alarming and this can be

441
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,079
scary and the reality is that sometimes

442
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,000
we just need to take a break

443
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,519
taking a break from everything from

444
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,360
infosec and then coming back a week

445
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,920
later you'll feel a lot more refreshed

446
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,759
but the thing is is that bug bounty

447
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,559
hunters it's it's a lot of hours and

448
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,919
dedication if you're doing this

449
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,599
full-time and especially if you're doing

450
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,760
this part-time and having a full-time

451
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,319
security job it's a lot of work

452
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,640
so trying to find time to balance that

453
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,839
personal life is also really hard

454
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,160
but the other thing is stressful is like

455
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,720
waiting for the communication

456
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,199
like there it can be terrible i'll be

457
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,600
honest there's delays and expectations a

458
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
conflict all the time when trying to get

459
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,760
paid out or getting an update on the bug

460
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,480
that you submitted and this can be also

461
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,640
very stressful and when we have so much

462
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,039
stress that isn't being dealt with this

463
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,440
ends up turning into burnout

464
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,880
so it's really important that when we

465
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,760
report to an organization is for us to

466
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,679
both understand

467
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,360
that

468
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,480
we're all

469
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,280
part of a situation and we all have

470
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,000
wants and desires and it's also a really

471
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,200
stressful to be in this industry

472
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,799
and i want to talk about that a little

473
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,440
bit further into this conversation

474
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,760
but first i just want to say is that

475
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,679
overall i hope

476
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,400
from the beginning of this conversation

477
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,320
is that everyone's pretty much burned

478
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,440
out at some point or at this very moment

479
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,840
and that is the reality of everything is

480
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,080
that with coven 19 we're taking care of

481
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,480
family members we're on camera daily

482
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,799
we're unable to leave our home sometimes

483
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,640
we can't see our friends and family and

484
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,320
some of us live alone some of us put off

485
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,799
some really important life events

486
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,440
and some of us have lost people because

487
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,280
of the pandemic

488
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,200
and our colleagues are struggling we're

489
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,039
struggling some of us are worried at

490
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,440
keeping a job some of us are doing bug

491
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,520
bounty for a living

492
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,960
because

493
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,760
we are trying every way possible to get

494
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,520
funds in our pocket

495
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,400
it's a very weird time

496
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,440
and the thing is it's okay to be honest

497
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,559
and say

498
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,559
now let's be honest with one another is

499
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,000
that

500
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,919
we can't keep doing everything all the

501
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:08,720
time

502
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,480
and that's okay but the thing is is that

503
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,000
we have to figure this out as an

504
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,640
industry of how to do something better

505
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,559
because the human element creates

506
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,120
security and runs on security and we're

507
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,120
all struggling right now to a certain

508
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,799
extent so

509
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,360
let's change this problem and dive into

510
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,720
five investments that we can do

511
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,280
so first things first listen and take

512
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,480
action together be strong be kind

513
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,440
ask your team what do they need don't

514
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,919
just listen and and then

515
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,080
you know not take action the thing is we

516
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,480
have to take actions so listen to one

517
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,039
another and try to get a good idea of

518
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,600
what you can do to help out this

519
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,120
situation

520
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,679
and because that is the reality of

521
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,760
what's going on is that even on secure

522
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,280
teams we're not being able to

523
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,440
communicate what is needed

524
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,440
um it might be like hey we don't need

525
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,960
this tool anymore there's this other

526
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,600
tool that does three things in one um it

527
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,480
could also be about trying to get

528
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,440
uh helping your cso out to go to the

529
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,120
board to push for vulnerability

530
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,400
disclosure policies or to get funds

531
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,039
um to even invest in the security team

532
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,000
it and

533
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
you know and that's the reality is is

534
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,640
asking people around you how can you

535
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,600
help

536
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,039
because the reality is that we kind of

537
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,039
have to work together to kind of get out

538
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,840
of this

539
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,520
mess like i said listening to one

540
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,440
another and taking action is definitely

541
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,520
important but also planning together so

542
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,440
if you're on a security team it's really

543
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,400
important is to create strategies and

544
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,799
revisit your security response plan

545
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,039
making sure that it's up to date

546
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,720
and also just keep on remembering

547
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,919
that you know if a tool is added or

548
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,280
removed that should be updated in your

549
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,520
incident response plan if there's a team

550
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,039
member change that should be updating

551
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,120
your incident response plan if there's

552
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,559
environment change such as everyone's

553
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,240
working from home now that needs to be

554
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,320
updating your incident response plan

555
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,080
it's so important that we have solid

556
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,159
plans because this does reduce the

557
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,720
stress of when a breach occurs that we

558
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,440
have a game plan in a sense

559
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,600
you owe it to yourselves you owe it to

560
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,200
your team your colleagues your

561
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,240
organization even your customers

562
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,919
now the one thing i want to also say is

563
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,159
that you also do have to practice

564
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,919
certain self-care which is if you're

565
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,679
starting to feel burned out it's time to

566
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,960
take time off that means

567
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,120
take time off that means

568
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,880
not being on social media that means

569
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,720
getting off of your computer your

570
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,960
devices that means taking a whole week

571
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,640
off because studies have shown if you

572
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,559
want to deal with burnout and get rid of

573
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,240
burnout take a whole week off

574
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:52,960
and

575
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,520
don't do anything work related it's

576
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,280
really important that's the only way

577
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,840
that you can recover believe it or not

578
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,320
is to do that and to make changes in

579
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,200
your workplace or your home life so just

580
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,280
keep that in mind

581
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,039
and i know that it's

582
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,600
very scary to take time off because

583
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,679
sometimes we're afraid if we take time

584
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,440
off that our teammates are going to have

585
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,280
to pick up our work or we're going to be

586
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,360
afraid that we're going to be coming

587
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,600
back to a dumpster fire so it's really

588
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,080
important to understand is

589
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,000
we need to take time off regardless

590
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,640
because even if you are not taking time

591
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,480
off and you're burned out chances are

592
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,520
you're going to impact someone else

593
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,520
or some other team or some other

594
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,320
organization because you're not able to

595
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,559
properly do what you can do if you

596
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,240
weren't burned out

597
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,480
now the other thing to keep in mind is

598
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,480
that this also means reducing your

599
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,120
meetings if you have meetings have one

600
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,080
day off a week for meetings

601
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,360
so then we can play catch up in a sense

602
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,520
now the other thing i would say is

603
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,120
investment number four is have a

604
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,960
vulnerability disclosure

605
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,520
policies and have or

606
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,360
an or okay and or a bug bounty program

607
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,240
i mean it if you are if you care about

608
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,559
your security at your organization

609
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,679
have one

610
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,799
but also not just have one but also make

611
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,760
sure that it is managed well and what i

612
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,520
mean by that is

613
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,400
having effective communications between

614
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,039
the hackers that are submitting the bugs

615
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,360
and your organization's response it is

616
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,360
so important that we have better

617
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,919
communication across the parties because

618
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,480
that's one of the reasons why it can be

619
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,280
very stressful to participate

620
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,679
so it's really important is to just make

621
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,679
sure that it's managed well have it

622
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,000
really structured well

623
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,760
and really

624
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,919
really try your best and get feedback

625
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,080
from the hacker so say like how can we

626
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,760
do better next time

627
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,080
ask them they love to respond and tell

628
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,840
you about that and also

629
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,039
hackers

630
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,360
feel free to reach out to them and ask

631
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,159
them

632
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,960
how can i do better next time how can i

633
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,919
improve my communication or how can i do

634
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,279
better and i think that's the one thing

635
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,600
that we can always do is just ask how

636
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,719
can i do better

637
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,080
now i want to just take this moment here

638
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,799
to just talk really quick on this one

639
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,200
investment number five is be kind and

640
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,320
respect boundaries

641
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,400
we have to just understand delays and

642
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,799
expectations are in conflict all the

643
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,279
time in bug bounty world and also when

644
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,679
we're reporting vulnerabilities but it's

645
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,600
really really important is to understand

646
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,600
to be kind to one another because we

647
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,760
don't know what the other person's going

648
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,799
through

649
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,400
and it's really important that we need

650
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,240
to start practicing empathy a little bit

651
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,039
more is to try to understand what their

652
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,039
situation is like so we can understand

653
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,240
one another

654
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,559
because by having empathy this also

655
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,880
helps reduce our stress but also this

656
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,760
allows us to

657
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,279
you know in the end kind of reduce that

658
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,919
burn out here and there or reduce the

659
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,000
possibility of getting burned out

660
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,960
and what i mean by is like

661
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,919
when it comes to submitting bugs

662
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,960
and you're waiting to hear back

663
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,600
please don't harass them

664
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,080
what i mean by that is don't contact

665
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,320
them on their social media that means

666
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,720
don't dm them on their twitter or

667
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,320
linkedin or their facebook or instagram

668
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,799
what i mean by that is understand that

669
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,760
it is their job and they don't work

670
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,679
twenty percent around the clock they

671
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:36,480
have

672
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,960
boundaries they work between nine to

673
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,080
five

674
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,320
in a certain time zone and that the

675
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,880
weekends they don't want to work

676
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,600
um and it's really understanding to

677
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,360
understand this whole situation is

678
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,960
please respect

679
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,720
boundaries

680
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,720
it is their job but they also have a

681
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,200
personal life outside of work

682
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,120
and respect that

683
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,919
so

684
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,559
when you do have communication with them

685
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,799
what you can do is ask

686
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,840
when should i follow

687
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,559
up

688
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,080
and i like this question quite a bit

689
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,080
because when they ask me that question

690
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,480
when should i follow up

691
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,320
i can give them an idea of like

692
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,000
reach out in two weeks or reach out

693
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,320
within seven days

694
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,400
and this really helps the conversation

695
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,159
because then you just mark it in your

696
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,600
calendar and then you

697
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,200
write back to them on that day if you

698
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,000
haven't heard back or an update

699
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,120
other thing is that if you are

700
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,440
basically following up with a hacker

701
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,520
that has submitted a vulnerability it's

702
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,320
important to understand that for some

703
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,120
bug bounty and hunting is their income

704
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,840
so

705
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,159
please understand if they're like hey i

706
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,480
haven't been paid out yet

707
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,960
understand that to them getting paid is

708
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,400
really important

709
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,440
because for some is their main income

710
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,440
and also it doesn't matter the thing is

711
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,840
if they've paid and you've accepted this

712
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,880
bug

713
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,200
they should they need to get paid out

714
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,600
the other thing to keep in mind is that

715
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,559
language and culture does play a role

716
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,320
we're all around the world we're all

717
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,360
different

718
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,760
so it's important to be kind in your

719
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,200
responses

720
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,279
but also

721
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,399
be as transparent as possible but also

722
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,880
to provide a time frame for them this

723
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,799
also helps with you when they try to

724
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,880
come back and to follow up with some

725
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,840
updates

726
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,880
so here's a quick slide of what you can

727
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,559
do right now to reduce burnout

728
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,760
is have set 101s for 15 minutes with

729
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,159
each employee if you're on a team make

730
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,640
money or fridays a no meeting day

731
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,080
set up a meeting with your team to

732
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,760
explore ways on how you can improve

733
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,840
together you can always create anonymous

734
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,000
survey to find out what is going on and

735
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,240
how the company can do better but please

736
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,000
note not everyone's going to participate

737
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,559
and don't enforce it but also

738
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,399
have vulnerability disclosure policies

739
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,880
and someone who can manage the incoming

740
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,679
at the same time

741
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,200
and last

742
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,120
remember when we work together and

743
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,360
listen to each other magic does happen

744
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,039
and when we work together making sure

745
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,440
people get personal time off without the

746
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,000
fear and take time away we then become

747
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,559
collaborative but also acknowledging

748
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,799
that when we collaborate we also reduce

749
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,399
the stressful items that hold us back

750
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,120
from our team from thriving and focusing

751
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,720
on that balancing of work and personal

752
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,520
life is something very important for

753
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,120
everyone and we just support that

754
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,039
and also

755
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,640
we need to work with the hacker

756
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,640
community bug bounty programs voluntary

757
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,640
disclosure policies are incredibly

758
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,840
important for reducing the stress on

759
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,480
your teammates because sometimes we need

760
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,960
a little bit of help outside our

761
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,360
security team

762
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,080
so overview right now does place you and

763
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,559
your team at a huge risk collaborate to

764
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,799
form strategies to improve the team

765
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,279
start making plans and revisit security

766
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,080
response plans and promote self-care by

767
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,120
being kind and respectful to boundaries

768
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,360
and also take some breaks that's the

769
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,640
only way you're going to heal from

770
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,000
burnout

771
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,840
i just want to say thank you all so much

772
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,799
for existing thank you for having me it

773
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,720
is a pleasure to be here if you have any

774
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,440
questions at all feel free to ask

775
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,360
but until then

776
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,880
keep on hunting and i

777
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,760
yeah and please stay safe

778
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,760
bye
