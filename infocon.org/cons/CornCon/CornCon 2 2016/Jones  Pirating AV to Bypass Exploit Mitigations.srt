00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:09,600
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> edline DRL cooking and user level</font>

and what we generally see in your life

<font color="#CCCCCC">different products we saw it and a lot</font>

with the two by patching so we looked at

all of this type of stuff right problem

47
00:02:52,349 --> 00:03:00,450
is you can get some problems with this

48
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:02,790
because of the relative jumps what

49
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,190
happens if you jump if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

know where you expect what happens if

it's really short prologue and you just

over with half of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jump</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's a</font>

00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:50,920
infections so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just as a sense</font>

146
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:53,890
it's not downloading a dropper to

147
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:57,459
execute the code it's their learning a

148
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:59,500
way to patch into something so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

downloading instructions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Patricks</font>

I past<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80 because it was nothing coming</font>

152
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:16,270
then that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be about suspicious</font>

153
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:18,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably enough these are the vendors</font>

154
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:22,810
that use this same technique good let's

155
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:25,239
go to injection which means when you're

156
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,619
in an in-memory and it's hooking in if

157
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">something is trying to interfere with it</font>

158
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:33,100
malware it's very difficult to find

159
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:35,950
these to<font color="#E5E5E5"> shut them off can't break the</font>

161
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:40,329
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this and you know if you</font>

162
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:47,110
don't want to do the import when you use

163
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:50,140
a GLS data directory still work now this

164
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:53,740
this is the most common way malware

165
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:57,610
likes to work busting<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dll elevated</font>

166
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:59,890
privileges off we go this is a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

167
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,570
simple Magnus there's lots and lots of

168
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:12,960
other ways

169
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:15,390
but it comes very nicely so the current

170
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">accuser injection extensively used on</font>

174
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:31,530
getting chomped persistence is key so

175
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:34,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">unfortunately it's very prone to</font>

176
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:42,209
mistakes and that's what we were seeing

177
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:44,340
listen is a red hawk from overwatch and

178

agrees my<font color="#E5E5E5"> friend muffler is because</font>

179
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:49,620
games also sometimes have trouble with

180
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:52,320
looking engines they had a particular

181
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:54,570
problem with easy hook because of the

182
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,880
way was hooking into a game booster and

183
00:10:54,570 --> 00:11:00,750
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> flagging all over the place in</font>

184
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:07,590
different problems so even the gaming

185
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:10,320
industry is no problem so when torrent

186
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:13,200
if you start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this stuff they</font>

187
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,380
originally thought it wasn't that bad

188
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:21,180
unusual cannot bat and as they started

189
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:25,170
digging it kept getting bigger so

190
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:28,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">eventually found six categories varying</font>

191
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:31,800
degrees of severity all offenders have

192
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:35,280
been identified so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the very</font>

193
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:39,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">first one all windows versions have this</font>

194
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:45,240
problem all up and anything to induce

195
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:48,750
home I DLL injection because of how

196
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:52,100
they're injecting in its really

197
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,100
unprotected

198
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:04,840
this is another big one that pussy

199
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:06,729
read/write executable code<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuffs I'm</font>

200
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:13,450
not sure why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would want to become</font>

201
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:15,190
stuff in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> state and it's predictable</font>

202
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:21,100
where the pointers out their constant

203
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:30,580
all windows versions have this too but

204
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:35,140
this also<font color="#CCCCCC"> means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shellcode right giggling</font>

205
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:41,620
that's right so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this but we also</font>

206
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:45,130
saw it in any measures this one was a

207
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:48,760
little less severe it didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even in a</font>

208
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:54,670
writable space<font color="#CCCCCC"> that still execute so</font>

209
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:58,569
it's because it still contains to code

210
00:12:54,670 --> 00:13:03,760
the address of that critical piece it

211
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:07,060
can bypass smoking altogether so now you

212
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:09,730
can still poplar necessarily right to it

213
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:14,530
but it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very easy to execute</font>

214
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:16,240
evilicious kind of this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that least</font>

215
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:19,180
was a little bit further<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the list</font>

216
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,710
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduced something below but for</font>

217
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:26,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we've seen a lot of people still</font>

00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:34,660
Newberry is very similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not quite</font>

220
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:37,450
as bad because it is the code stuff but

221
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:41,819
still this is not good<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't like</font>

00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,820
three Dwight executable code segments

this is another<font color="#CCCCCC"> one that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not with</font>

flow paradigm ass get bypassed over this

226
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:08,319
and ya know you can you're leaving<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

230
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:22,870
a persistent place but it can easily be

00:14:18,819 --> 00:14:29,709
found easily be bypassed you can execute

whatever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like and again the</font>

233
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:35,079
module so instead of the booking engine

being retried executable now<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've just</font>

237
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:58,329
this is what we found here into the city

<font color="#E5E5E5">of junk minute lots of baby as well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

239
00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:03,550
questions 05 yeah don't symposium use

240
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:07,180
functions already require administrator

241
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:10,990

242
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:13,899
the user code has already in a state

243
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:17,980
that it can be altered if we go and

244
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:20,410
which processes most of them use of 32

00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:27,969
user ready state they can be done that's

247
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:30,699
why a lot of stuff can actually be

248
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:32,769
written even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if as power users</font>

special soft guess they can and we but

256
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:57,719
we were showing how Mallory knew it too

257
00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:00,719
and jump in and you'll say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in my</font>

straight speaking of the demo yes my

of Mario

264
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:38,230
so we're using trendmicro as an example

00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:38,230
why we're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> them as a moment</font>

their dad Jose there's a particular dll

291
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:48,020
that has a vulnerability<font color="#E5E5E5"> for gadgets and</font>

292
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:50,990
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> over explain this more</font>

293
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:59,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">specifically so now we're going to watch</font>

00:20:50,990 --> 00:21:10,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">as we learned your pd a-- scroll through</font>

295
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:12,050
now what we want to do before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we open it</font>

296
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:16,610
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> put that deal outpost of the one with</font>

297
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:25,010
gadgets so we're set a<font color="#E5E5E5"> breakpoint here</font>

298
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:28,399
so we watch exactly what happens so here

299
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:30,110
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go Linda this is something users do</font>

300
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,840
every day they click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on stuff all the</font>

00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:35,179
time no idea whether he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to back</font>

302
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:37,100
down this is why it's actually kind of

303
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:41,930
fun actually seeing what it's doing here

304
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:44,590
this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> river Justin a way to live in</font>

305
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:44,590
separate point

306
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:59,749
okay so now we've got the right point so

307
00:21:54,919 --> 00:22:05,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">now we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to watch what happens as we</font>

308
00:21:59,749 --> 00:22:08,139
copy that code in to the gadgets / do is

309
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,139
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find the first gap</font>

310
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:31,179
first vacation I we did the great board

311
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:33,639
so that was the opportunity start

312
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:37,600
stepping through and actually watch

313
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:40,360
there couldn't be injected<font color="#E5E5E5"> in so now</font>

314
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,699
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start seven through until</font>

315
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:52,240
we get this until we get back hook stuff

316
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:56,860
so then we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all that free space</font>

317
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:59,100
we just saw them so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their next</font>

318
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,100
step

319
00:23:06,029 --> 00:23:10,529
copied it in right half<font color="#CCCCCC"> later than all</font>

320
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:12,718
that slack studies and then we can

321
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:16,489
finish finish stepping through the code

322
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:16,489
watch it execute

323
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:26,590
because we're next researchers you only

324
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:26,590
have it

325
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:36,389
what's up

326
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:59,220
air

327
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,870
so

328
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:10,840
we look we decided them to look at what

329
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:12,340
third pretty engines are vulnerable this

330
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:16,750
very funny mr. Potato Head to use to

explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> TV using this potato heads and</font>

332
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:21,220
it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> really great methodology</font>

333
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:27,220
to teach people<font color="#CCCCCC"> what viruses are how you</font>

336
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:36,250
like to do it it's very limited it's

337
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:39,370
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> time-consuming that's why we want</font>

00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:40,809
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and yet but party engines because</font>

339
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:49,959
they've already done the work for<font color="#E5E5E5"> words</font>

340
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:51,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">and they integrate much easier now the</font>

00:24:53,559 --> 00:25:01,809
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the programs or use this hooking</font>

344
00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:06,340
mention that's no small task easy hook

345
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:08,500
the ones we saw the problem does all

346
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:10,840
this nice little stuff but it also

347
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:17,559
leaves the facebook stuff and rewritable

348
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:19,928
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> modules it also has that voting</font>

349
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:25,750
practices that yourself then uses

350
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:30,429
naughty it changes pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> heavy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so now</font>

351
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:36,580
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was a problem the buyer to</font>

352
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:42,100
is so there's your resource<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones it also</font>

353
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:44,530
have to be right except abco hug so

354
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:48,490
cover up into commercial grade you would

355
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:53,918
think this would work nope and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i never</font>

356
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:57,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">lots of security vendors</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use this my</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">previous employer I know who well we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

358
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,610
that code

359
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:13,230
so then<font color="#CCCCCC"> spend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the mattress under the</font>

360
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:15,030
thunders detours they're not of you

361
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:18,450
neither you would pay for 10,000 that I

362
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:25,610
suppose would be etched in stone over

363
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:25,610
because they show you exactly

364
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:37,080
we couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear too much into detours</font>

365
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:38,580
and all the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we fund because</font>

366
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:41,399
we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> waiting for them to release the</font>

367
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:46,139
patch and the patch that get delayed by

368
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:47,670
about a month so<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately I can't</font>

369
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:52,290
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into as much stuff because they</font>

370
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:54,630
literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> just enough so as we are now</font>

371
00:26:52,290 --> 00:27:01,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to we can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into more detail with</font>

372
00:26:54,630 --> 00:27:01,430
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> look of clarifications</font>

373
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:14,830
so just the show and this was just an

374
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:16,660
our little pool of research we only do

375
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:22,840
about a dozen security vendors give or

376
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:37,720
take most of them have multiple models

377
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:42,370
so friend had one of the six why we

378
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:44,860
haven't mentioned them couple open fix

379
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:47,199
them all around independently and then

380
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:53,889
everybody else you can see the time to

381
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:57,100
fix so one of the things that our guys

382
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:59,290
did was they eventually made some

383
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:01,750
research tools so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually look</font>

384
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:03,190
to see if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got this problem here</font>

385
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:08,350
on your own network or in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own code</font>

386
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:12,970
so it's readily available<font color="#E5E5E5"> on github</font>

387
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:16,510
anybody can access and it's free but it

388
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:19,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">shows if you have any other great stuff</font>

389
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:19,590
three great<font color="#E5E5E5"> X capable</font>

390
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,540
real<font color="#E5E5E5"> service this one</font>

391
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,100
so

392
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:40,060
it's double-edged sword you need the

393
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:45,280
hooking to augment functionality but we

394
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:49,330
haven't seen ways where it quite as

395
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:57,840
secure so there's a lot of security

396
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:57,840
implications both of Allah bestow on

397
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:03,450
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> appreciate your attention</font>

398
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,950
especially since this is the last one of

399
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,950
the day any questions

400
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:15,459
for my own scared you I thank you very

401
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:15,460
much appreciated

402
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:20,869
