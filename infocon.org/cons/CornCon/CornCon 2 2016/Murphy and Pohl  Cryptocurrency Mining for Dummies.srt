1
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,409
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about mining</font>

2
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,419
cryptocurrency like a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of dollies</font>

3
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:32,509
because that's what before we start<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

4
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:35,330
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> saw still unwilling to start out who</font>

5
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:37,100
we are I'm top-hole this is brandon

6
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:41,059
murphy we're both from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Des Moines we</font>

7
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:43,160
belong to a little group called set PSM

8
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:45,260
it's a city second out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Des Moines</font>

9
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,790
where we you know get together a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

10
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,500
monthly basis to talk about the

11
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:52,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">information security related topics</font>

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:54,559
first of all there's another there's

13
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:56,390
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> city sex around the country so</font>

14
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,120
there's one down in Kansas<font color="#E5E5E5"> City that</font>

15
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:01,190
like bunch of awesome guys is like a

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple hundred</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people every month so</font>

17
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:07,520
we've been going down there quite a bit

18
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:09,560
we love those gangs and think they

19
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,600
created the cryptocurrency we've gotta

20
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,979
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> hilarious of Des Moines somehow</font>

21
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,220
control their entire cryptocurrency

22
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:17,869
market so so that's that's kind of the

23
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:22,250
premise of<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we started from so we</font>

24
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:26,060
love those<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys who that's what you</font>

25
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:27,260
don't know yeah so who here knows about

26
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,770
big one who's ever heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> that term</font>

27
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:32,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">Canada's cotton very sweet so our talk</font>

28
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,399
is not about Bitcoin what we're actually

29
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,980
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about with a</font>

30
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,170
cryptocurrency that the guys down at

31
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,480
decades he created called set<font color="#E5E5E5"> Casey coin</font>

32
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:44,360
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually a fork of light</font>

33
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,970
corn so so everyone knows like one who

34
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,770
knows it big

35
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:51,030
like my<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I select ones a fork a</font>

36
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:54,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bitcoin and so they made a fork a flight</font>

37
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:57,840
point because I Casey so when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

38
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,330
started things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we knew</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like we</font>

39
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,340
were told ians we're certainly we still

40
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:04,530
are told News definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> holding</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lives</font>

41
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,000
when we started and you know we knew we

42
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,369
want to mess<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the stuff but we had</font>

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,830
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea how we didn't understand Clark</font>

44
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:13,350
change with it understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> miners or</font>

45
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,210
anything and so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted we need to</font>

46
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,350
figure it all out nor mess with them you

47
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,490
know first we have to figure it out then

48
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:20,850
we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how we're gonna</font>

49
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:22,680
mess with them right so you know kind of

50
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,709
a cryptocurrency 101 you won't talk

51
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,450
about the wall to death so with

52
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:29,430
cryptocurrency you need somewhere to

53
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:32,730
store your money right<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're mine your</font>

54
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,740
points<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so you use a wallet to do</font>

55
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,660
that and there are two major forms<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

56
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:40,830
walnut paper wallets which look like

57
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:42,990
this and and electronic balls which is

58
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:45,450
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> gooey looks kind of like this so</font>

59
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:49,890
the concept of the electronic wallet is

60
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:52,679
you mind your miners when you you're

61
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:56,220
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to search for a blocking in beg</font>

62
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,769
fine over rewarding<font color="#E5E5E5"> hash board if that</font>

63
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,660
that goes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your wallet right so the</font>

64
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:01,860
miners find your money and they put them

65
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,390
into your<font color="#E5E5E5"> wallet it's important to</font>

66
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,980
understand that relationship because we

67
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,109
had no clue right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> they know what</font>

68
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,268
wall it was yeah so actually in the

69
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:11,820
wallet is what keeps track of like the

70
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:13,890
entire block chain right so so you know

71
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:15,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">whereas like your wallet is like</font>

72
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,579
typically standalone right like you've

73
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:18,870
got money<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your wallet it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

74
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of thing and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's how the paper</font>

75
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,220
wallets work but like leaves electronic

76
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,560
wall it's actually kind of keep track of

77
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,690
the entire block chain so I as other

78
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,549
people do transactions your wallet

79
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,370
software actually downloads all those

80
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:34,799
transactions and then I'm able to verify

81
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,569
all that transaction so we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

82
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,359
it later we're basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> a transit</font>

83
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:40,920
isn't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a transaction until like 50</font>

84
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:42,569
people confirm like yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

85
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,480
totally legit transaction that occurred

86
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:47,700
right and so so it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> your your</font>

87
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,369
wallets that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> helped coordinate</font>

88
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:53,189
that work effort to validate everyone

89
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,599
else's transactions on an hour and so

90
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:56,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's where you know that's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> big</font>

91
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:58,828
distinction between like a paper<font color="#CCCCCC"> wallet</font>

92
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:00,719
that can have value and electrical

93
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:03,000
electronic wallets<font color="#E5E5E5"> that do more than</font>

94
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,219
just keep your keep your coin but then

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,439
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> also you know help validate the</font>

96
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:09,120
rock watch am as well as if you decide

97
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,939
to start mining and<font color="#CCCCCC"> giving your own</font>

98
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">point out of thin air they're the kind</font>

99
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:19,139
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traffic at that kind cortisol</font>

100
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:22,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so here's how the set Casey coin is</font>

101
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:24,419
supposed to work right so so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> did so</font>

102
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:26,669
there's a bunch of parameter so when

103
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:28,409
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> fork like point there's a bunch of</font>

104
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:30,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">parameters that they can choose and the</font>

105
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:33,270
parameters that we care about the most

106
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:36,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">work how often is the point supposed to</font>

107
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:39,180
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> generated so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I add at the normalized</font>

108
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:41,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">hashing ray whatever that is everything</font>

109
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,169
for or 86 seconds it's supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

110
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:45,060
generate a new point so it means about a

111
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:47,070
thousand point every day are going to be

112
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">generated by the attack now so it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

113
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:50,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">like a leg up you get one now you did</font>

114
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:53,699
some more do you get one kind of thing

115
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:57,210
and so and then every maybe four hours

116
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:59,009
so just over three days then there's

117
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,049
this concept of difficulty that gets

118
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:04,979
recap so that's an important<font color="#E5E5E5"> upfront</font>

119
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:09,060
grammar and in like a but unlike a

120
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:11,008
Bitcoin markets and litecoin we're like

121
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,900
the price of the coin goes

122
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:14,400
down because it's a economy<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

123
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,188
market where people actually spending

124
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:21,388
real money<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get going or spending</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 20</font>

125
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:23,490
real life set<font color="#CCCCCC"> Casey decided</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

126
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:25,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">just set an arbitrary like a hundred</font>

127
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,059
coins is worth your diet and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only</font>

128
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:30,389
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can use these coins for</font>

129
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:31,649
is to buy slack so like at their

130
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:33,749
meetings of stuff they'll have like

131
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:36,839
velcro badges they put a new backpack

132
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:39,180
and t shirts polos or hoodies and things

133
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:42,059
like that and so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> either pay them</font>

134
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:45,719
with real money or you can pay them skc

135
00:05:42,059 --> 00:05:48,180
and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Casey will get you dollars</font>

136
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:51,180
worth of you know of credit you don't

137
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,819
have their swag and so these are that's

138
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,339
how it's supposed to work now one thing

139
00:05:53,819 --> 00:06:00,990
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> learn is is that there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

140
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:03,029
a mining arms race right so you go so

141
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,430
basically you start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you can</font>

142
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:08,729
you see use the mind and then you know

143
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:12,029
meta gets in the GPU my and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason</font>

144
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:15,300
and then you know like<font color="#CCCCCC"> all out mining</font>

145
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:17,759
basic mining or somebody else will do it

146
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,999
for you and so as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go through this new</font>

147
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">attack cpu money yeah so we didn't</font>

148
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:24,360
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know anything about psych a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Seco</font>

149
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,699
undermining when we started right so

150
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,289
like two months<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago two months</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

151
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:29,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">we actually started this effort decided</font>

152
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:31,438
to mess with these guys and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm</font>

153
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:34,050
sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> down there after that their</font>

154
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:36,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">commutes pumpkin do like over in a</font>

155
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,399
corner and<font color="#E5E5E5"> boobs like spinning up clock</font>

156
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,749
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost instances that are paid for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

157
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm i am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mind the crap out of this</font>

158
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:43,800
right and i didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to do that</font>

159
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so we had to go compile that</font>

160
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,439
electronic wallet and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i used my nerdy to</font>

161
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:51,299
connect to that wallet give work and put

162
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:52,740
the ones back into so one of the great

163
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,689
things is that since they're trying to

164
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">get people to mind like they put</font>

165
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:59,219
together a nice wiki like hey what do

166
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:01,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what don't you know and here's</font>

167
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:02,639
the step-by-step instructions to do it

168
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:04,620
so we were just kind of blindly

169
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,209
following that just to try to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

170
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,889
out they got great destruction so

171
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:09,599
they're basically telling us how we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

172
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:10,949
mess<font color="#E5E5E5"> with them right yeah I honestly</font>

173
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,748
<font color="#CCCCCC">when I went through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I wasn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

174
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:13,920
if they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> just roll on everyone right</font>

175
00:07:12,749 --> 00:07:16,560
off right like I

176
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:19,710
yeah well in they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems with the</font>

177
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,500
gate up revo<font color="#E5E5E5"> Winkle so the problem CP</font>

178
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:24,630
you might know is that it causes the way

179
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,880
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cpu load right like this will</font>

180
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:28,590
fire up one instance of my dear one

181
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,450
thread my nerdy for each<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPU that you</font>

182
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:32,340
have and it uses one hundred percent of

183
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,740
it right so cooling is important so<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

184
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,810
your shit is a certified but they'll

185
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,640
mitigate that risk you use mana cost

186
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,620
right like these are my CPUs anymore

187
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,360
Alan care if i use on presentable it was

188
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,160
clouded cost of already pigs that eps

189
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,130
for life so I just really have no cost

190
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:50,700
to me so good way to mitigate that so

191
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:52,770
then so then moving on from you know you

192
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,930
know basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> once we just discovered</font>

193
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:57,330
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you looked at a fast CPUs are super</font>

194
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:59,160
over subscribe and like our little

195
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,870
computers or whatever like i had an i7

196
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,750
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> four course or whether i could</font>

197
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:06,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">do like 40 kill attaches per second</font>

198
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:08,400
whereas like entire network goes like a

199
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:11,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">300 Tommy knows a significant percentage</font>

200
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,840
but we wanted to do way better so we

201
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:17,100
heard that you know you could use things

202
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:20,010
like GPUs in order to do mining faster

203
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:22,230
right so one of our bodies has a nice

204
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:24,270
GPU and one of his boxes at home he's

205
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:26,820
like oh let me try<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and spin it up</font>

206
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,890
so so there's a different version

207
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:31,409
instead of my nerdy called cgminer

208
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:34,289
that's optimized for GPUs and you

209
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:37,229
basically just take the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CG mine use</font>

210
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:38,939
it well here's my<font color="#E5E5E5"> wallet go you know get</font>

211
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:41,729
the work from the wallet and start doing

212
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:44,310
buying things and he was getting I don't

213
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:46,380
know Floyd something like 400 or 600

214
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:48,449
killa hashes per second so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

215
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:50,820
to been essentially with one card in his

216
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:53,940
home computer double their network great

217
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:56,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">at hashing just because we went to GQ</font>

218
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:59,280
money which was awesome but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font>

219
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:02,460
enough right yeah um I know you've got

220
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,410
AMD<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nvidia displayed up there yes GPU</font>

221
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,900
mining I've heard AMD is a lot better

222
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,670
than nvidia that it's I've heard the

223
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,430
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have any experience</font>

224
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:13,140
with what<font color="#E5E5E5"> sandy so</font>

225
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,550
we were messing with nvidia it's not

226
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,550
going to be a work just fine and

227
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:20,430
actually our buddy had just like a

228
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:22,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">brand-new what was a GTX 10 a GTX</font>

229
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,329
pennies on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Western collar yeah</font>

230
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,970
things like this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> too much shit</font>

231
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:29,490
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you turned it out and it didn't yeah</font>

232
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:32,490
because it turns out that that GPU is

233
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:34,260
passed out ways again cgminer hasn't

234
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:36,390
been optimized for pass gas so that's

235
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:38,399
part of the problems with why one may be

236
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:41,339
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than another it may be with how</font>

237
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,649
it does the math in the car and so his

238
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:45,480
like three year old<font color="#CCCCCC"> card was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

239
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:47,760
you know not going to shit out of his

240
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:52,410
brand-new car because you know he was

241
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:54,360
using cgminer optimized for nvidia they

242
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:57,569
know it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was in the right</font>

243
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">math</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> algorithm to the car so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

244
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,050
you kind of have to match that off but

245
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,610
I've heard the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing like per watt</font>

246
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,979
like I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> aim things supposed to be</font>

247
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:07,410
better but we actually in the course of

248
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,600
all that's never had any access to empty

249
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:12,870
because of the next step was we would

250
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:16,050
deny me have a GPU<font color="#E5E5E5"> in class right so so</font>

251
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:18,180
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like in a double yes so so you</font>

252
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:19,949
they've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> two different types of GPU</font>

253
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,660
instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up like you know this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

254
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:24,360
dallas on you you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the smorgasbord</font>

255
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:25,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">of like all these instances</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm surely</font>

256
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,750
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to have something together</font>

257
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:31,110
they don't they only have two GPU types

258
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:33,750
both of them are an ebay or sorry nvidia

259
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:35,790
based what they're smaller instances got

260
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:37,800
one card that can give us about two

261
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:40,199
hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> and fifty-six mega our killer</font>

262
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,569
hackers per second and that they've got

263
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,640
their bigger instance which basically is

264
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:47,640
that having<font color="#E5E5E5"> one cards got four cards and</font>

265
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:51,060
it can do about one mega hash per second

266
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:53,430
and so so we first like a bunch of

267
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:56,130
dummies would spit up full price

268
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:58,229
instances of these guys right so so you

269
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:01,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">look like down about fifty two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of us an</font>

270
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:02,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">hour to 30 an hour how's it going what</font>

271
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">was it was</font>

272
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:06,009
right and we're like and so we were we

273
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:08,559
were spending some we're spending some

274
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:10,600
point because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it makes cool right and</font>

275
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:11,829
we're like this kind of sucks this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

276
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,019
not you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not catch</font>

277
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:17,108
advantageous to us and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we we</font>

278
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:18,759
discovered that that there's these

279
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:20,739
things called spot instances and i'll

280
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:22,629
owe you can see here it says request by

281
00:11:20,739 --> 00:11:23,919
instance and there's this market price

282
00:11:22,629 --> 00:11:25,479
because there's at any given time

283
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:28,359
there's a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> surfers out there</font>

284
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:31,720
that they're not using right so instead

285
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:34,119
of paying<font color="#E5E5E5"> 230 an hour right here like</font>

286
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,069
when I took the screenshot i can pay as

287
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:37,600
low as twelve cents<font color="#E5E5E5"> an hour so what you</font>

288
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:39,519
do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of like a bid system</font>

289
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,169
where you say how<font color="#CCCCCC"> I spit up a hundred</font>

290
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,999
instances it looks like the market price

291
00:11:41,169 --> 00:11:45,639
is about twelve cents an hour so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

292
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:47,379
put in a bit like 15 cents an hour so

293
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:49,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">this would cost me if I spot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 100</font>

294
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:51,999
distances<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifteen bucks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for one hour but</font>

295
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:54,789
I get a hundred servers doing this right

296
00:11:51,999 --> 00:11:56,529
so it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's eally going oh this is</font>

297
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:58,329
going to be pretty kick-ass because if

298
00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:00,639
you do the math this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the big instance</font>

299
00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:04,089
for fifteen cents an hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

300
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,879
go blow the crap out of the the hash you

301
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:10,059
great that that's a second second season

302
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:13,779
it's a and then what happens is that as

303
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:16,269
your as that market price of the supply

304
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:18,519
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> demand of the spot instances that</font>

305
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:20,230
market price goes above whatever your

306
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:22,179
maximum<font color="#E5E5E5"> did was your machines just get</font>

307
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,799
shut off and you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it like</font>

308
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:25,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">persistent so it's like whenever that</font>

309
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:27,189
mike rowe Price gets down to wherever

310
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:29,499
you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> that'll spin up as many</font>

311
00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:30,910
machines as it can and to you know kind

312
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:32,559
of turning machines on and off<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

313
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:36,009
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was previewed slot you see</font>

314
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:38,049
that we create our own<font color="#CCCCCC"> customized so</font>

315
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:40,929
that basically as soon as this machine

316
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:43,029
fire started up by start CPU mining on

317
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:45,789
the box and then I start GP mining and

318
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:47,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">all mine back to buy it when we started</font>

319
00:12:45,789 --> 00:12:48,769
my personal wallet right yeah that was

320
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:51,559
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that kind of</font>

321
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:53,209
yes where we didn't know about spotted

322
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:54,980
so they<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with AWS</font>

323
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:58,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">worked right like I'd never dealt with</font>

324
00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:00,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> grade this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> image that</font>

325
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,629
minds to itself rights like the wallet

326
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:04,969
is on the minor well then my spot

327
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:07,939
instances sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> shut off and now I</font>

328
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:10,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">just lost all that corn and so it's very</font>

329
00:13:07,939 --> 00:13:12,980
important that you send all of those all

330
00:13:10,549 --> 00:13:16,069
these servers that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> bind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a wallet</font>

331
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:17,929
that will always<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up so yes because</font>

332
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:20,719
money could your mom so<font color="#CCCCCC"> when once you</font>

333
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:22,759
get a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost instance those always</font>

334
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">up he's mine back to that so that man</font>

335
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:26,269
while that money wasn't walks right so

336
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:29,420
yeah I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money we lost</font>

337
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:30,980
a sec<font color="#E5E5E5"> Casey coin but yeah it's a fake</font>

338
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:35,360
money the fake as well it's wrong but

339
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:37,549
fake money can have real fast and so so

340
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">then after we decided okay this is good</font>

341
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:42,350
and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually got some hashing rates</font>

342
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:44,749
of pretty decent like 15 mega actions to

343
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:46,249
120 maggot hatches we<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided we take</font>

344
00:13:44,749 --> 00:13:49,129
you we learn oh there's these things

345
00:13:46,249 --> 00:13:52,220
called a six and basically what a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sick</font>

346
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:54,079
is is there's different ways so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

347
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,819
can either custom<font color="#E5E5E5"> fab it or you can take</font>

348
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,349
what's called field programmable gate

349
00:13:55,819 --> 00:14:00,799
array any computer engineers in the

350
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:03,439
house now<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what it is is imagine</font>

351
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,939
like a regular CPU in a computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

352
00:14:03,439 --> 00:14:06,740
just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of transits because hook</font>

353
00:14:04,939 --> 00:14:08,480
together right<font color="#E5E5E5"> Intel figures out how to</font>

354
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,089
weigh them out and hook them up well

355
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,740
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> math PGA is basically it's a bunch</font>

356
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:15,740
of transistors but they're not hooked up

357
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,720
and you download software to it and the

358
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:20,389
software will hook up those those gates

359
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:24,019
to basically create your processor and

360
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:26,929
so asics are basically people develop

361
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:28,970
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the Verilog programs whatever</font>

362
00:14:26,929 --> 00:14:31,579
to hook up those transistors so that

363
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:33,949
although they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> good for running</font>

364
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:35,989
like Intel processors they're good for

365
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:38,540
that one task of doing like we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

366
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:41,480
script or a script based hashing

367
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:44,569
algorithms and so since there there's

368
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,100
Spencer specialized just to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one</font>

369
00:14:44,569 --> 00:14:48,529
thing you can do that thing really

370
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:51,259
really bad so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get these a cig</font>

371
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:53,779
boxes so we went on when you get out

372
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:54,350
evening our hands on amazon yeah you

373
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:57,860
won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

374
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:59,240
yes yeah so we wanted to you know so

375
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,950
that the highest a straight on the

376
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,380
single instance of a single GPU that we

377
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:05,330
were looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at was 256,000 and hashes</font>

378
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,710
per second and we wanted more so we

379
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:09,530
started looking at these days<font color="#E5E5E5"> dicks and</font>

380
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:11,660
this one was advertised at 28 to 32

381
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:13,520
million hashes per second right<font color="#E5E5E5"> he'll</font>

382
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:17,449
attach this isn't that good factor of

383
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:18,980
magnitude<font color="#CCCCCC"> value Mart right so we wanted</font>

384
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,210
to do this so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know where to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> buy</font>

385
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">these things right like there's shady</font>

386
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,650
like Bitcoin formzee shit and I kind of

387
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,990
burned myself a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple times like</font>

388
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:29,480
finding ones that did like 14<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tara</font>

389
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:32,510
hashes I'm like oh my<font color="#E5E5E5"> god right it's</font>

390
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,550
like eight dollars and but that's redic

391
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:36,350
going right so is it and so big coin is

392
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:38,150
a different algorithm altogether shot to

393
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:40,490
50 states and that shit don't work with

394
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:43,670
sexy going right so learn that one hard

395
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:45,440
way but so I find this guy on on amazon

396
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:48,229
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the seller basic he's got it</font>

397
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,520
nameless<font color="#E5E5E5"> rockin like a boss hopefully he</font>

398
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:54,590
doesn't watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> us cuz he's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only link</font>

399
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:57,230
icon and so I'm like hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I i I'm like</font>

400
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:59,300
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> advertised for 265 box and I'm</font>

401
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:00,860
like I messaged him oh hey I'm really

402
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:04,099
interested in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to get started</font>

403
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:05,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">into this like minor niche coin but it's</font>

404
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,430
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit outside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of my price range</font>

405
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,530
life I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just beginning like it do you</font>

406
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:11,420
have anything different that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be a</font>

407
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:12,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit cheaper for a beginner and</font>

408
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,969
he's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> no I mean this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the best</font>

409
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,770
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the beginner but what I'll do</font>

410
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:18,380
is I'll knock a hundred bucks off so<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

411
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:20,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">your 160 bucks I get this sign of you're</font>

412
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:22,580
like done comes with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a power supply so</font>

413
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,710
the nice thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know about these suits</font>

414
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:28,130
boxes are that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've really any any a</font>

415
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:29,630
steak is they consume power right so the

416
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:33,800
power supply that came with this was a

417
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:37,550
1200 watt power supply and it was really

418
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:39,890
shitty like so it was clear that it

419
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:41,660
wasn't supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be in this box like</font>

420
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:43,580
he must have had a good power supply

421
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,760
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he'd kept for himself and gave me</font>

422
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:49,209
like a really shitty<font color="#CCCCCC"> I won and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

423
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">like an electrical tape together</font>

424
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:52,689
but I'm like all right whatever like

425
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,220
let's do it i really wanna mess with

426
00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:56,800
these guys so we're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the DEF CON or</font>

427
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,720
we're going out to rest on and this

428
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,550
thing's all neon on the way reddit ship

429
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,689
in from the sky<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have some problems</font>

430
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:03,219
shipment but whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get worked out</font>

431
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:04,779
so in the meantime<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm setting up a</font>

432
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,490
raspberry pi so these aren't standalone

433
00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:08,859
miners you have to have a computer that

434
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:11,529
runs the wallet that is designed to work

435
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:13,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">with that minor it is like USB yep yeah</font>

436
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:14,740
USB so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually the back side of</font>

437
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:16,389
the fans look on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other side of this</font>

438
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,609
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> like just a big golden mole</font>

439
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:20,589
where Graham cables out our supply and

440
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:23,589
then there's just like it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> fee like</font>

441
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:26,260
USB to serial adapter inside the box and

442
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:27,908
so I instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my raspberry pi and i</font>

443
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,799
tell my wife she's knocking down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> deaf</font>

444
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:31,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">night until I'm like hey this big box is</font>

445
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:33,340
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show up all I need you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is</font>

446
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:35,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">take it downstairs plug in the power</font>

447
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:37,870
supply plug in the USB<font color="#CCCCCC"> cable every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

448
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:39,760
an enrollment right so she calls me

449
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:41,379
she's like uh I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to hook</font>

450
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,059
this thing about least two cables baby

451
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,740
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on she's like it's not two</font>

452
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:48,039
cables there's like 18 parts to this

453
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:50,890
pictures yeah so yeah so the power

454
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:53,620
supply was not connected at all why

455
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:55,870
cause i right gregg and she's like I

456
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:58,959
think I got this<font color="#E5E5E5"> right I'm like don't</font>

457
00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:00,879
mess it up and so she makes it up

458
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,159
insertion it works like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't I</font>

459
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,870
can't believe it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the power</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> supply</font>

460
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:06,640
she's like there's not enough room

461
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:09,610
inside the<font color="#E5E5E5"> box for this power twice the</font>

462
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,169
cables are huge and so that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

463
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,459
just ran it out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hole where the</font>

464
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:14,320
power supply would normally mount and

465
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:18,610
just at the bars play on top it's really

466
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:20,799
shady well and then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it after</font>

467
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:23,350
you got that in a dead<font color="#E5E5E5"> cow yeah so I</font>

468
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,330
come back and it's working<font color="#E5E5E5"> for Yelp the</font>

469
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:28,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">while I tweak some settings whatnot and</font>

470
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:30,428
so I come I'm gonna work<font color="#E5E5E5"> Monday and get</font>

471
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:32,080
this alert that says hey you're my hair

472
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:33,309

473
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,320
good right so i'm at work<font color="#E5E5E5"> old</font>

474
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:37,240
politically so i get home i start like

475
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,320
halfway on this raspberry<font color="#CCCCCC"> prob hi trying</font>

476
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,899
to figure out why it's not working so

477
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,220
finally I can't get it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so I</font>

478
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:45,279
walked downstairs in my basement where

479
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:47,250
this index cloud was hell on hotel and I

480
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:49,920
smell fire

481
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,720
oh right and so I get down<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and</font>

482
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,550
sure shit this power supply where that

483
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,650
electrical tape was it's all melted and

484
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:57,120
like the cave that the wiring like I

485
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:59,190
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull it apart like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slow like</font>

486
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,590
Kristin aren't right it's shot so the

487
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:03,090
thing almost burned my house down just

488
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,379
that she a power supply so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> very sure</font>

489
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:06,060
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only thing that saved me was the</font>

490
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,640
electrical<font color="#CCCCCC"> tape that shows like melted</font>

491
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:10,350
goo and I'm like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stopped it like</font>

492
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,690
that stuff oxygen from getting onto this

493
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:14,850
and actually starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fire so be</font>

494
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:19,980
careful ended up buying the power supply

495
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:22,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">off ebay 28 bucks for an HP 1200 watt</font>

496
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,760
power supply 39 bucks for a breakout

497
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,060
board and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just required about</font>

498
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,680
myself and it works great so I don't

499
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,510
rest better yeah actually runs better

500
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:33,150
said she<font color="#E5E5E5"> power supply was like starving</font>

501
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:36,600
it so now so I actually broke it while I

502
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:38,580
was rewiring it but so its source just

503
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,250
replace us all to screw with your

504
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:44,580
buddies yeah yeah yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah everybody</font>

505
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:47,160
else but suppose so so as we're ever

506
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,830
gonna you know work along here so so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

507
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,930
kind of the other sizes covered<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

508
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:55,740
actual mining<font color="#E5E5E5"> side so so we figure out</font>

509
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:57,750
that that we were you know once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

510
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,610
above the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hat trade right so you were</font>

511
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:02,340
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> more mining majority of the coin</font>

512
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:04,979
so like like when the hatch rape

513
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:07,230
everyone else was 300<font color="#CCCCCC"> kilo hatches and</font>

514
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,150
we were at like 10 mega<font color="#E5E5E5"> hashes or</font>

515
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,130
something like that end yet ten nine

516
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:13,200
matches in that low you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were</font>

517
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:14,760
getting like ninety-five percent of the

518
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,040
coin right so like they weren't getting

519
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,480
any and we're getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch and but</font>

520
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,610
we're like we can do better right so

521
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,620
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like that at this point so</font>

522
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:25,800
then what happens is as you blow through

523
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:29,010
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> blockchain so every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 3,500 so each</font>

524
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,928
block is so you know every block is

525
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:32,450
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font>

526
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:37,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">so once invited</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some you move on to the</font>

527
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:40,490
next block and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> every 3516 blocks is</font>

528
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:43,249
is when it says okay how long did<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

529
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:45,799
take the quote through those 3516 blocks

530
00:20:43,249 --> 00:20:47,869
and then it recalculates difficulty so

531
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:50,840
when we like jumped in with a high

532
00:20:47,869 --> 00:20:54,259
amount of CPU turn to blow through that

533
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:56,539
those three<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3,500 bucks in no time now</font>

534
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:58,220
like a nap and it's supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font>

535
00:20:56,539 --> 00:21:00,740
your member back on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ian</font>

536
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:03,409
supposed to take me six hours 3-4 hours

537
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:05,360
right and so so then what happens is

538
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:08,029
that like well that<font color="#E5E5E5"> took two hours or</font>

539
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,008
one hour is supposed to take 84 so that

540
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:13,129
the difficulties got to jump up so that

541
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:14,960
it tries to make it so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we stayed</font>

542
00:21:13,129 --> 00:21:17,389
at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> hi</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> caching rate it's going to</font>

543
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,419
take a steam forever so so we'll we'll

544
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:22,879
jump in and we'll get those first 35

545
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:25,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">buttons really fast and then it slows us</font>

546
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:28,070
down so it takes us three<font color="#E5E5E5"> in or Die 84</font>

547
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:30,470
hours in order to get the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3500</font>

548
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:33,139
clock so so you know and so then what

549
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:35,389
happens is is will jump in we will get

550
00:21:33,139 --> 00:21:37,369
the Hat trade up get through a bunch of

551
00:21:35,389 --> 00:21:38,539
coin and then we are we weren't getting

552
00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:40,039
stuff that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where the loot at</font>

553
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:41,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">first we didn't understand difficulty at</font>

554
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:43,158
all right we're like why this is not

555
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:45,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">working as well as it was yesterday</font>

556
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:47,389
right because it's because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> realized</font>

557
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,580
oh we blew through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole you know</font>

558
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,840
kind of that round with block<font color="#CCCCCC"> change and</font>

559
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,220
now we're on the new round and they're

560
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,408
<font color="#CCCCCC">making we may be more difficult for</font>

561
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:56,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">ourselves and so then what we what we</font>

562
00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:58,100
did at that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're like well let's</font>

563
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:00,259
just throw more in it and throw more at

564
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:02,509
it so so so there is actually kind of

565
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:03,830
stair step approach that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

566
00:22:02,509 --> 00:22:06,259
next slide though if we did with more

567
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:10,490
right so so we're still trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> figure</font>

568
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:12,230
out a<font color="#E5E5E5"> better time so we're still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> try to</font>

569
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:13,549
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the light we haven't figured</font>

570
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:16,759
out that difficulty thanks we're like

571
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:17,539
throw more at red and so yeah so that

572
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:19,850
apparently Mike

573
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:23,210
Matt rentals com is instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">burn Brandon's house down with what</font>

point zero zero one<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin you can get</font>

582
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:42,559
like 24 hours of some kickbacks<font color="#CCCCCC"> miners</font>

583
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:44,720
on mining rig rentals com and then you

584
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,759
just give them<font color="#CCCCCC"> some Bitcoin say here's</font>

585
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,679
the pool or the wallet I want you to

586
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:50,690
mine to go for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and then they</font>

587
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:52,789
basically you know hook up to your walk

588
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:54,470
to your wallet server or in our case we

589
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:58,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">have this one we're running pool server</font>

590
00:22:54,470 --> 00:23:00,169
which we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a little bit they</font>

591
00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:02,449
did basically do all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work and you</font>

592
00:23:00,169 --> 00:23:04,070
can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> some really good action at it</font>

593
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:06,409
get it for the essay on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hardware</font>

594
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:08,299
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> binding example yeah so they're so</font>

595
00:23:06,409 --> 00:23:10,070
these guys are like kind of a

596
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:11,749
conglomeration company so there's tons

597
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:13,639
of people that made rigs out there and

598
00:23:11,749 --> 00:23:15,919
do it sighs rings like Brandon's and

599
00:23:13,639 --> 00:23:17,988
then but like they stop mining because

600
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,519
like like that arms race for whatever

601
00:23:17,989 --> 00:23:22,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">pointing their mining is passing over</font>

602
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:23,659
that much gold hardware put it on my

603
00:23:22,129 --> 00:23:26,359
Ingrid<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gretel so they're kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of like</font>

604
00:23:23,659 --> 00:23:28,580
the clearinghouse for<font color="#CCCCCC"> poking you like so</font>

605
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:30,349
this guy may have a rig that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

606
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:32,059
he's guys he wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run it for so much</font>

607
00:23:30,349 --> 00:23:34,220
an hour so they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of the</font>

608
00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:36,918
go-between to hook Brandon up with that

609
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:39,919
guy right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's an eBay oh there's</font>

610
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:44,899
a goober they were yeah okay yes it's

611
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:48,169
like uber<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucker crypto printed yet haha</font>

612
00:23:44,899 --> 00:23:49,998
and so and so so instead of us being

613
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:52,429
smart we're like well we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

614
00:23:49,999 --> 00:23:55,429
jack up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hash rate so we can keep</font>

615
00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:57,559
longer than that<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3,500 point before the</font>

616
00:23:55,429 --> 00:23:59,840
difficult because up of course we

617
00:23:57,559 --> 00:24:02,178
weren't smart about this right so we

618
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:06,199
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> started all and yeah pushing lens</font>

619
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:08,809
isn't so then so so I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know</font>

620
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:11,299
like what the biggest egg was so on

621
00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:13,070
money Rick Rick rentals you see like the

622
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:13,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">the biggest box they ever in our these</font>

623
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:16,230
game

624
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:18,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">Titans which do about 300 million hashes</font>

625
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:19,980
per second so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> about like the peak</font>

626
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:23,760
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get right now with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a script</font>

627
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,810
and yes that are publicly available so

628
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,210
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next biggest thing that's going to</font>

629
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:31,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">come publicly available is 84 which you</font>

630
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:34,170
can do about 400 hashes per second and

631
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:37,170
the key thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know there is that like</font>

632
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:40,260
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> KNC Titans can i watch you to do</font>

633
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:41,850
and once one of those comes out like it

634
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:44,040
raises<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bar for everyone right now</font>

635
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:46,260
everyone has to test compete for that

636
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,370
difficulty and so right now though I

637
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,870
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're starting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to push the limits</font>

638
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:51,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">of what that s correct might need to do</font>

639
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:53,219
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least it was publicly available well</font>

640
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:55,379
in so then now they're focusing on

641
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:57,150
getting it cute less power right so that

642
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,190
they're super fast but it's like well

643
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:01,320
let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> just be more for space is more</font>

644
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:02,610
cooling and more energy well how do we

645
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,710
make that more efficient you'll make

646
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:08,610
them smaller make them cooler take less

647
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:10,680
power so they can keep going right so

648
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:13,050
just to kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> be reiterate where we</font>

649
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:15,390
started right it was that the network a

650
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:17,280
straight overall was 300<font color="#CCCCCC"> killa actions</font>

651
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:21,150
per second right and the difficulty was

652
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:23,790
0.002 which means it was really easy if

653
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:25,980
you stay around that that that are not

654
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:28,350
hashing to get a thousand point a day

655
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:30,090
across everybody right so that our

656
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:32,580
attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is basically our</font>

657
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:34,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">tactical what we decided to do we're</font>

658
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:36,540
like step one wait for the difficulty to

659
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,430
be low so when we started with a super

660
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:41,760
low right and thence that's too is we

661
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:46,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">mind everyone make sure you watch chain</font>

662
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:48,840
and then step three is as we go to step

663
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,640
one right so once we did so then so then

664
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,949
we got the difficulty up here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

665
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,530
we turn all of our shit off right then

666
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:58,020
we let<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in a couple of times it took</font>

667
00:25:55,530 --> 00:26:00,510
them like a week to turn through the

668
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:02,340
hell because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know the difficulties</font>

669
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:03,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">up here but there you're there minding</font>

670
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,909
like they're in first gear right you

671
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:07,210
know when we had a 12th year you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I</font>

672
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:09,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">in so the end so they</font>

673
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:10,750
it was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> slow see we back off you</font>

674
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:12,520
know we're not doing anything at this

675
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:17,140
point and there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> ballplayers early</font>

676
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:19,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're not getting any cooler good you</font>

677
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:22,179
can see you know graphically this is

678
00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:23,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">steep so this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where like we jacked it</font>

679
00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:25,059
up and then we're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh I want you</font>

680
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:26,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">know vibe up you know right here we're</font>

681
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:28,779
like we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not getting coin year lease</font>

682
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,399
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> so early</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's get on board</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

683
00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:32,529
finally we would get<font color="#E5E5E5"> here we're like</font>

684
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:34,479
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's just turn it off and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

685
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:36,190
sure not a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> days later they blew</font>

686
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,659
through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of the black king the</font>

687
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:39,279
difficultly went way back down because

688
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:40,840
it took about this is probably about at

689
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,960
least right here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were like</font>

690
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:45,820
guys guys guys it's all on let's go kill

691
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,190
it and we took<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up here and then we're</font>

692
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:50,678
like kill it and then kill it<font color="#E5E5E5"> Greg this</font>

693
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:52,419
is about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we added be a six you know</font>

694
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:54,549
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> the binding regretful you see we</font>

695
00:26:52,419 --> 00:26:56,140
went through way to the roof and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

696
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:59,770
point the difficulty of you can't read

697
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:03,220
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a 0.35 right so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> started at</font>

698
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:06,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">0.002 and we got the difficulty all the</font>

699
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:07,840
way up to 0.35 right all right and that

700
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:14,709
was making it difficult for that just

701
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:16,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">wait until you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see what happens next and</font>

702
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:21,850
then here is where we gotta to

703
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:27,908
ultimately we took it to 20 right oh

704
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:31,418
yeah we just to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it really difficult</font>

705
00:27:27,909 --> 00:27:35,590
and so so what's funny is it there's a

706
00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:37,510
flash show me I i was told them unlike<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

707
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:39,580
got this like no and this is like still

708
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:42,070
when we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing GPU mining I'm</font>

709
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:45,039
like I'm like man it looks like somebody

710
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:47,168
just threw so through something is like

711
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:50,470
we got enough to like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 51 at one point</font>

712
00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:52,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">but yeah 12 and 15 megatons and and</font>

713
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:53,920
there whatever I wasn't it like 300

714
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:55,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">kilometers earlier</font>

715
00:27:53,920 --> 00:28:00,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's the line they're like holy fuck</font>

716
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:03,010
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop right where do i hack stuff guy</font>

717
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:06,070
right there like lightning each other

718
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:11,350
who's doing this they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no idea oh</font>

719
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:13,000
man you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know and so they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

720
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:14,889
freaking out<font color="#CCCCCC"> because there's some guy</font>

721
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,600
that would show some interest I like new

722
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:18,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bob this stuff they like did that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

723
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,439
jump<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and he's you know lying the crap</font>

724
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:22,300
out in or hats crew from going out like

725
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,450
there were seriously working<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and</font>

726
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:28,450
so the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had was that we were</font>

727
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:31,180
over spending right because because

728
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:33,250
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole network when we started</font>

729
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:34,450
about three hundred killer hatches we

730
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:36,490
probably could have gotten away with

731
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:38,590
having it at one mega hatch right

732
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:40,360
because we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were significantly higher</font>

733
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:41,889
than the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the network that we</font>

734
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,719
could have we could have just been good

735
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:46,450
there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that just kind of gone up and</font>

736
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:49,450
up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> down and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then they still because</font>

737
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:52,270
he's like but seventy percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> point is</font>

738
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:54,010
better than ninety seven percentage

739
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:56,050
points is the ninety-seven percent point

740
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:57,730
means we take the difficulty way up here

741
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:59,950
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to keep a high level hashing</font>

742
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:02,530
and so and then the second problem we

743
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:04,450
had was that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making it</font>

744
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:06,070
difficult for ourselves to<font color="#E5E5E5"> write so we</font>

745
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:09,910
had to mind so we kept having to raise

746
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:11,800
the bar on our own selves in order to

747
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:14,620
keep because of our whole goal was to

748
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:16,330
get a whole lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on shortly alright</font>

749
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:18,100
so we're making it difficult for self

750
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:21,899
and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> third problem we have is we</font>

751
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,899
were just simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> overspending right</font>

752
00:29:23,549 --> 00:29:29,970
yeah yeah well we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> so one of the</font>

753
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:31,529
things problems one so one of the issues

754
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:34,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">when she had was that we were mining</font>

755
00:29:31,529 --> 00:29:35,730
everything to our<font color="#CCCCCC"> style to our own</font>

756
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,809
wallets and we couldn't like I didn't

757
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:38,249
know how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> brandi was doing he</font>

758
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:39,960
couldn't see what I was doing so we

759
00:29:38,249 --> 00:29:42,539
create a full server so that basically

760
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,159
we could see collectively how fast your

761
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:46,139
remaining compared to everybody else so

762
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,809
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we can figure out why oh we</font>

763
00:29:46,139 --> 00:29:51,209
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know charles adler stuff and</font>

764
00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:53,610
yes so that the night<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we gave the</font>

765
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:56,340
talk down at second<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's I Casey we</font>

766
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:58,229
got the network up to 12.3 nigga hashes

767
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:01,649
and I'm not talking till it hatches or

768
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:04,230
mega hatches we're talking right to just

769
00:30:01,649 --> 00:30:06,119
you know through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the roof and so then</font>

770
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:08,700
that's what we create<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point but then</font>

771
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:10,918
what are we doing you know what gave it

772
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:13,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">all back like like during the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk we</font>

773
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:16,350
made these custom<font color="#E5E5E5"> psych dsm paper</font>

774
00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:18,149
wallets and and we went super early that

775
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:20,789
they tasted to all underneath the seats

776
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:22,439
every night I had one that you know

777
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:24,929
during the<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk I'm like I've got lon</font>

778
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">come yo yo guys were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> complaining i spent</font>

779
00:30:24,929 --> 00:30:29,009
i use my $10,000 computer one<font color="#CCCCCC"> way for</font>

780
00:30:27,269 --> 00:30:32,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">defcon for we got i got one going</font>

781
00:30:29,009 --> 00:30:33,989
because it's right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm like sorry man</font>

782
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:36,239
you're here you get the paper wall

783
00:30:33,989 --> 00:30:37,619
within which we<font color="#CCCCCC"> put 500 point like it</font>

784
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:40,200
looks like you know it's enough to buy

785
00:30:37,619 --> 00:30:42,029
some swag right and so so then we're

786
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:44,070
like I gotta get<font color="#CCCCCC"> back up breath and I'm</font>

788
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:48,509
under your seat and so we put paper

789
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:50,759
wallets everywhere each was enough coin

790
00:30:48,509 --> 00:30:52,320
to x square right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I put enough on</font>

791
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:54,389
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're cheapest wagons 500</font>

792
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,830
second AC point and so my whole goal was

793
00:30:54,389 --> 00:30:57,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">dogs the swag</font>

794
00:30:59,389 --> 00:31:03,439
paper<font color="#CCCCCC"> wallets I got a copy of all the</font>

795
00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:08,869
press key so I'm like you gotta use this

800
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:21,228
jacked up their difficulty so hard I and

801
00:31:19,849 --> 00:31:26,869
current rate it's gonna take at least

802
00:31:21,229 --> 00:31:29,419
two months time Jack<font color="#CCCCCC"> be watching there's</font>

803
00:31:26,869 --> 00:31:33,228
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole bunch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of stop John yes is like</font>

804
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:35,059

805
00:31:33,229 --> 00:31:36,649
exchange because if we do that then go

806
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:39,589
like you'll actually have real value it

807
00:31:36,649 --> 00:31:42,168
would be like my mom did catch up for

808
00:31:39,589 --> 00:31:43,489
some really really yeah but you know

809
00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:45,529
double spending in fact there's a whole

810
00:31:43,489 --> 00:31:48,229
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things you know that like we</font>

811
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:50,959
feel now that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like kind of a you</font>

812
00:31:48,229 --> 00:31:53,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">know kind of a public project we can</font>

813
00:31:50,959 --> 00:31:54,440
paint it right it's not like Bitcoin or

814
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:56,089
something like that work young people

815
00:31:54,440 --> 00:32:07,669
probably come and kill you you put the

816
00:31:56,089 --> 00:32:10,489
coins lovable that's about all we had

817
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:12,859
you guys have have any questions it if

818

let's go yeah ultimately how many coins

825
00:32:32,029 --> 00:32:36,820
did you mind about 70,000

826
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:40,830
in perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're only about a</font>
