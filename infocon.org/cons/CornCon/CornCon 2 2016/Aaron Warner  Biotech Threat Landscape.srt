great DNA I got to I got to be a part of

building a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool small company</font>

22
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,390
when I was funny and then it got big and

23
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:44,690
complicated and private equity got

24
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,880
involved but we got to build stuff in

25
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:49,850
San Diego and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I spent time here for the</font>

26
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:54,830
spent time in Asia and got to watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

27
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:57,259
grow got to play a part in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I like</font>

28
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:59,370
the startup world I like the

29
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:07,530
relationships that people build

30
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:09,150
it's the good stuff to me so yeah I'm

31
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,530
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break this down into and a</font>

32
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:12,900
bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different things so that I</font>

33
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:17,760
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretend that everything in biotech</font>

34
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:22,290
or in life sciences is any maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

35
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:26,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">like it's missing so defined excuse me</font>

36
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:35,519
sorry no I guess we're sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:39,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">trunk no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so life sciences</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

38
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,970
is a world where you make and you're

39
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,560
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help the human condition I</font>

40
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,380
think that's how most of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys</font>

41
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,870
would define it there are people as

42
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:51,150
Richard pointed out of varying degrees

43
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,150
of the care about that like there are

44
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:56,700
DoD places that are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build</font>

45
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,340
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who can help us to kill</font>

46
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:03,060
other people on the flip side of that

47
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,230
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in last night's as you</font>

48
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,560
spend an inordinate<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of time</font>

49
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:09,988
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep bad things from happen we</font>

50
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,450
were talking at dinner last night if

51
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:15,390
you've seen the movie outbreak the guy

52
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,369
that Morgan Freeman plays in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> movie</font>

53
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,769
is actually a guy named Steve Lincoln at

54
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:23,700
CDC I worked really<font color="#E5E5E5"> closely with Steve</font>

55
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:27,180
look and I can tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you as much crap as</font>

56
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:30,780
the CDC takes is nobody who cares more

57
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:33,400
about helping people than the guy who

58
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:38,319
runs the infectious diseases

59
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:40,450
is really wonderful generally so lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

60
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">sciences is this sort of spectrum liked</font>

61
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:45,970
anything technical this spectrum of

62
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,310
people who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing good things and</font>

63
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:52,329
some people who aren't doing good things

64
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:56,799
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's serve everybody in between so</font>

65
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:59,560
this part is meant to try and not make

66
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,480
everything in biotech seem unique

67
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,810
because it's not there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

68
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:07,750
same sort of Groundhog Day stuff I you

69
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:10,060
have credit<font color="#E5E5E5"> cards and UPI</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and dss sort</font>

70
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:14,620
of challenges that's kind of everywhere

71
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:18,430
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> employee a person identifiable</font>

72
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:20,649
information pci and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the information</font>

73
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,960
so you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> employees and they have</font>

74
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:24,638
personal data and interestingly enough

75
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,570
in Europe they have the right to be

76
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:31,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">forgotten which is a challenge deleting</font>

77
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:34,630
an employee's information from

78
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:36,280
everything when you have a lot of things

79
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:40,449
when there are a lot of layers is very

80
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:42,969
challenging but it's not unique there

81
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:45,460
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> company and international company</font>

82
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,440
has those sorts of challenges you

83
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:50,830
privacy and regulatory that's not unique

84
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:55,030
everybody has a border and everybody has

85
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:57,280
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> online presence and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not to any</font>

86
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:59,530
industry biotech isn't unique and not in

87
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,039
that respect but you kind of go a layer

88
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:06,219
down and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the world that i worked</font>

00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:32,710
very different needs and very different

<font color="#E5E5E5">with them they have expectations about</font>

102
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:48,790
how to protect their information I'll

103
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:51,580
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into some of that and what they</font>

104

assume you're going to protect for them

105

the guy is in academia it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

different then corporate risk and drives

the guy at roche the different things

108
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,950
but as a company or as an organization

109
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,230
and life sciences is like this you kind

110
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:10,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">of have to serve all masters in that</font>

111
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:15,760
respect it makes for a real challenge

119
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:34,000
transactional volume means things the

<font color="#CCCCCC">depth of the CIA tried up here right</font>

nines is sort of a good day five is

123

better a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of minutes at downtime</font>

124
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:48,160
is a huge deal when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have 55,000</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">what take stuff off of a shelf it's</font>

131
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:07,060
humor there's an airplane in cedar

132
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:09,789
rapids it's waiting or in humans

133
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:13,240
you know that has to get on that

time is within geography from a security

136

standpoint is a real challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> of we</font>

about what is my property versus was the

everywhere like the number of endpoints

147
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:54,910
in biotech I think we were three point

148
00:07:51,280 --> 00:08:00,880
eight X number of devices to the plays

149
00:07:54,910 --> 00:08:03,310
so you have to change to adapt that we

150
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:06,909
had a lot of computers far more

151
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:10,570
computers identical but even that isn't

152
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:13,330
terribly mean if you go wandered into

153
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:15,340
the microprocessor the street like the

154
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:19,990
fabs those guys have very similar

155
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:22,570
Chinese so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're there it's the</font>

156
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:24,850
combination<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those things not any one</font>

157
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:27,099
of them individually that makes for some

158
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:30,220
of the better challenges in life

159
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:32,680
sciences but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you start to get into</font>

160
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:35,530
the like really actually unique stuff

161
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:38,228
and I would love for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys to throw</font>

162
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:42,669
rocks like if I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this part wrong</font>

163
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:44,740
especially please tell me this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

164
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:47,439
first time I'm actually trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to trying</font>

165
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:51,820
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> out this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is my leg top 5 list of</font>

166
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:54,400
things that are unique life sciences and

167
00:08:51,820 --> 00:09:00,370
together custom life sciences or<font color="#E5E5E5"> bio bio</font>

168
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:04,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">uh I google unique animals for this</font>

169
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:05,980
there was some disagreement over at

170
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:09,579
dinner<font color="#E5E5E5"> right doesn't brother that was a</font>

171
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:11,740
back for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> potterhead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I really don't</font>

172
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:18,370
know it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a good bit of photoshop</font>

173
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:21,670
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> forget it was intended to describe</font>

174
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:24,790
some academics and corporate when you

175
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:27,219
take researchers who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are used to working</font>

176
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:31,030
in academia<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it is an inherently</font>

177
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:32,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sharon environment in fact they would</font>

178
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:35,589
tell you a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font>

179
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:38,199
mostly<font color="#E5E5E5"> about they want to show the world</font>

180
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:40,150
and they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to collaborate on</font>

181
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,130
their research a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times in</font>

182
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:43,390
academia I see you smiling which means

183
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:46,810
you've worked<font color="#CCCCCC"> and actually communal</font>

184
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:48,970
before they use they use their sharing

185
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:54,310
to make themselves<font color="#CCCCCC"> look kind of awesome</font>

186
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:56,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they use their sharing to prove one</font>

187
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:58,359
another wrong and that's part of what

188
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:02,110
makes science and academia work really

189
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:04,810
well in a corporate environment where

190
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:07,720
the company owns the thing that you do

191
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:10,479
having a person who<font color="#CCCCCC"> believes that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

192
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:14,860
own the work that the company's doing is

193
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:17,530
an inherent clash and its really really

194
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:20,590
challenging not to get too specific that

195
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:22,780
there was a researcher that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would</font>

196
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:24,670
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to he would lock his fios down and</font>

197
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:28,360
then he would encrypted hard drive then

198
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:30,670
he would move his data off of the pc

199
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,580
from time to time we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to send</font>

200
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:35,560
help desk in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there at night to image as</font>

201
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,840
disk because we needed backups when

202
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:40,329
we're spending<font color="#E5E5E5"> done the doctors on guys</font>

203
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:46,780
thermodynamics research but it was his

204
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:48,550
and then he posted and when I company

205
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,720
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> a corporation invests a million</font>

206
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:52,769
dollars or whatever in thermodynamics

207
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:55,410
research they like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make use of those</font>

208
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:59,279
as a result of that work<font color="#E5E5E5"> he did not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

209
00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:01,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that's sort of the car crash</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

210
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,259
happens when you mix at Damien and

211
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:08,790
corporate i'm leaving ethics aside

212
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:10,920
because you know you can make all sorts

213
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:13,349
of arguments there's a spectrum<font color="#CCCCCC"> in irv</font>

214
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:16,649
weather information should be apparently

215
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:19,199
free or whether it's entirely controlled

216
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:23,129
between those two points the guys in

217
00:11:19,199 --> 00:11:25,829
academia tend to be more to the free

218
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:28,829
variety<font color="#CCCCCC"> of corporations have it's</font>

219
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:33,929
challenging to manage and to own that

220
00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:37,319
relationship right number four yeah this

221
00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:40,559
is no secret to<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody in here mom when</font>

222
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:43,229
your customers include<font color="#E5E5E5"> Monsanto when</font>

223
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:45,149
your customers including brooch when

224
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:49,829
your customers include like the top 10

225
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:53,399
list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> nanas</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um it can make your life</font>

226
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:56,128
<font color="#E5E5E5">really interesting you see guys showing</font>

227
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:58,740
up on the firewall that you know if you

228
00:11:56,129 --> 00:12:02,100
worked in textiles they might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font>

229
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,929
up nearly as often right do they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

230
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:07,170
legitimate right with any of those

231
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:11,999
customers sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get clients</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but yeah so</font>

232
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:14,610
anyway yeah whether you like them or not

233
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:16,980
if you're in infosec and we're pro from

234
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:19,860
life sciences that's challenge you have

235
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:22,319
to deal with and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> really smart</font>

236
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:24,990
people were wearing pissed off you want

237
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:28,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do things to stop your customers from</font>

238
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:31,319
doing their work that's it's a really

239
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:32,649
unique challenge it does not happen in a

240
00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:35,170
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other</font>

241
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:37,329
history you're selling shoes people

242
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:41,229
don't get pending it as pissed off about

243
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:48,128
shoes and they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> about GMO or</font>

244
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:50,559
Diagnostics or whether we're not drugs

245
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:52,660
get to market fast enough like people

246
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't get as passionate about those</font>

247
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:57,639
things as doing in life science so it's

248
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,110
one of those inherent and things like if

249
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:04,809
you jump into that boat that's kind of

250
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:06,759
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you customer diversity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because yes</font>

251
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:11,230
please is that a new word or did you<font color="#CCCCCC"> Leo</font>

252
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:13,929
API I'm sorry you hacked as Jimmy

253
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:18,639
activism yeah so spelling is not much

254
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:23,379
hahahahahahaha they can get five brownie

255
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:26,050
points yeah it's all to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> loan you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

256
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:28,569
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do new terms of use are you</font>

257
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:30,459
today<font color="#CCCCCC"> dizzam houston diversity is</font>

258
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:33,939
another challenge we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mentioned</font>

259
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:36,040
this but it's kind of unique we have all

260
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:39,129
the customers who are doing life

261
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,498
sciences research or any kind of biotech

262
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:44,559
rd you have a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different needs</font>

263
00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:47,679
and requirements and expectations and

264
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:50,110
applications with<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar thing right</font>

265
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:53,980
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that word from a customer in</font>

266
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:55,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> south of shanghai what they're</font>

267
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:59,139
doing with a custom elegant complete<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd</font>

268
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:02,350
may be different than customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's it</font>

269
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:03,820
in a university of uw-madison I<font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font>

270
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:12,550
it's pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> clear</font>

271
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:16,180
there yeah the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> orders that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you get</font>

272
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:18,250
when you work in custom biology are

273
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:22,810
different than the order<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get if</font>

274
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:26,530
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> Amazon so if you order a ladder</font>

275
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:29,170
people will know that you're a ladder or

276
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:32,829
a lot of uses for that thing we place an

277
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:34,900
order for a custom biological not only

278
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:39,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">does it indicate the sir problem</font>

279
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:41,980
complexity right it also describes what

280
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,110
it is that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> working in so the</font>

281
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:47,530
polite term biotechnical<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottle system</font>

282
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:50,740
you know what animal you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> working in</font>

283
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:52,270
you know what area of the animal you're

284
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:54,040
working in you know what gene they're

285
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:56,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at in what area of the gene</font>

286
00:14:54,040 --> 00:15:00,069
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at and then you combine</font>

287
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:03,160
those data with they never ordered one

288
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:05,350
so they're sort of taking a shotgun

289
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:08,530
approach at this area of this genome of

290
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:13,630
this organism let's say it's a corn

291
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:17,709
right look if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're trying to get corn</font>

292
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:19,689
that stands up better in the wind you

293
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:22,810
might look at pacific area of that

294
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:26,740
genome that causes resiliency in the

295
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:29,680
expression you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fibers that</font>

296
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:32,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">cause this dog to to be stronger</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

297
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,969
stands up better and you're taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

298
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:38,189
shotgun approach to trying this on

299
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:40,379
this on and then you make all that corn

300
00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:44,129
that one stands out best of the wind

301
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:45,839
bingo you have a new product the

302
00:15:44,129 --> 00:15:50,009
interesting thing about that from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

303
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:52,410
suppliers end point is that that order

304
00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:59,009
tells<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that that's what they're up to</font>

305
00:15:52,410 --> 00:16:06,000
but that's that's what they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

306
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:09,959
thanks for your time it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good thing</font>

307
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,220
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> got the 3ds found no I assume you</font>

308
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:15,569
won't get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> coach she's going to leave</font>

309
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:16,620
out the heart of this prior boy what

310
00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:23,250
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> he have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with underwater</font>

311
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:31,620
basket we owe interesting NASA yeah so

312
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:38,310
in order in biotech of a custom don't

313
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:45,750
worry so the thing about got some orders

314
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:47,550
it connotes the order the product that

315
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:50,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">they order itself connotes the</font>

316
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:54,000
application that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really unique so if</font>

317
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:55,229
you are screwed<font color="#CCCCCC"> from ace hardware use</font>

318
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,449
that for a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things you</font>

319
00:16:55,230 --> 00:17:01,379
can like bolt a window on you might also

320
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:04,168
screw that into a weapon how do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

321
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:05,230
that is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Connery's in our</font>

322
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:09,309
friends<font color="#CCCCCC"> that other</font>

323
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:11,709
group how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know when its crew that</font>

324
00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:13,089
you're going to use put window into

325
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:14,949
place and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know that it's a</font>

326
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:18,458
screw<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use in a</font>

327
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:21,220
firearm or have whatever right the

328
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:22,510
answer is it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to</font>

329
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,449
answer that question because what we

330
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:28,089
were making it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really specific area</font>

331
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:31,419
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are a whole gene to tell you</font>

332
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:33,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">things about like which organism is it</font>

333
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:37,150
in because one of the interesting things

334
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:38,559
about life we share most of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> genome</font>

335
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:42,220
with pretty much everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else that</font>

336
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,020
grows or walks or flies whatever it's a

337
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:48,130
very small<font color="#E5E5E5"> part</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of our genome</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

338
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:49,929
specific that makes us human but jeans

339
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:51,340
are a little different and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

340
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:54,250
there's a functional purpose you can

341
00:17:51,340 --> 00:18:04,480
that will describe

342
00:17:54,250 --> 00:18:06,730
what will describe let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> one that's</font>

343
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,910
a very specific thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's very easy</font>

344
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:14,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">to spot my group broke really good</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">golem for its part</font>

347
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:21,280
here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing for</font>

348
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,070
for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> God about that most of the guys</font>

349
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we can get all of the guys I think</font>

350
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:29,230
we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> one in ten years that we're</font>

351
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:31,570
ordering things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> read on pathogens</font>

352
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:33,820
they're mostly guys who are trying to

353
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:37,179
detect it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> in order to detect it you</font>

354
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:37,970
have to be sure to verify so in the same

355
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,390
way that you

356
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:43,620
[Music]

357
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:43,620
it will pick up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:47,389
a profile of a person<font color="#CCCCCC"> that thought was</font>

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come rub your back</font>

360
00:18:47,389 --> 00:18:51,258
kind of want to make sure about that

361
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:52,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">rehearsing looks like genomics is really</font>

362
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:54,300
no difference

363
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,429
instead of genetic level but you need a

364
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">picture of Ebola</font>

365
00:18:56,429 --> 00:19:00,970
yes

[Music]

367
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:06,600
so yeah an order unlike ordering a

368
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:08,639
ladder

369
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,439
I is really descriptive<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the kind of</font>

370
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,070
work that

a customer is doing whether they're or

372
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:18,300
corn something or people<font color="#E5E5E5"> something more</font>

373
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:20,550
like over

00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,500
a lot of vinyl wrap<font color="#E5E5E5"> University can work</font>

00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:28,230
so yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> flip</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and and the other thing and</font>

377
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:30,540
this is the reason for bad karma cruel

378

search crown crown jewels on their kids

380
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:45,860
haha yeah the thing so the corn examples

381
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:54,250
if you can find a specific

382
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:56,469
modification to achieve that allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> car</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to stand up look really really heavy but</font>

384
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:01,690
it's a very valuable

385
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:04,389
that's like pioneers

00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:08,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">next five quarters is there inside of</font>

387
00:20:04,389 --> 00:20:11,019
this there isn't modified<font color="#E5E5E5"> like poison</font>

388
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,440
just you can make corn that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the win</font>

389
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:13,440
is high

millions or billions of dollars they are

391
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:22,740
billions relies on that order they just

00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:26,100
replaced<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you so from an info 7</font>

393
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:29,059
perspective protecting those data just

394
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">that order is</font>

395
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:35,200
let's keep you up<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> night</font>

396
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:38,949
you have filters for<font color="#CCCCCC"> university of</font>

397
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:42,730
pathogens your software one of my good

398
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:45,880
buddies actually really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Bob Dawson</font>

399
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:49,809
is a doctorate and critical analysis of

00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:52,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">attire of literature and was the former</font>

job is to be a speed bump the Russians

403
00:20:55,179 --> 00:21:03,400
yeah brilliant bioinformatics guy built

404
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:07,629
that so here are bad things<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what</font>

405
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:09,940
how we find what bad things bothering we

406
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:12,309
still work together at<font color="#E5E5E5"> pro secular like</font>

407
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:17,260
he's he's guy that I call all the time

408
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:20,620
like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bob help help me he's the guy cuz</font>

409
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:22,600
I'm a little thick and he's the guy that

410
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:25,209
you calling I can't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> my head around</font>

411
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:28,178
this problem here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem to make</font>

412
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:30,789
and he will email you back because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's</font>

413
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:33,549
a doctor victorian era literature like

414
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:36,580
10 pages humanity and eight different

415
00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:38,650
scenarios five of which you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can never</font>

416
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:40,510
even thought of maybe one or two if

417
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:42,460
you're really lucky like yeah I thought

418
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:45,370
about that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but the</font>

419
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:47,020
other five do even when the other one

420
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,479
it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that'll never actually</font>

421
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:51,280
it's not physically possible for that

422
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">happening in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this hizzy those are also</font>

423
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:58,270
spawn synthetic admission is working<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

424
00:21:53,500 --> 00:22:01,059
developing a synthetic step I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

425
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,730
biochemist I don't know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a</font>

426
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:05,510
distinct

427
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:09,860
if it reads on for you whether it's

428
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:14,300
static or what is organic I don't I

429
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:17,929
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's it so yeah this all</font>

430
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:19,760
comes down to my favorite which is that

431
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:22,280
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really custom couldn't put</font>

432
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:29,360
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a shelf you had to miss</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it like</font>

433
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:31,910
now so a biological that is something

434
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,159
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make on the fly and in a</font>

435
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:37,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">very short period of time forces you to</font>

436
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:39,620
do different things we got really

437
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">frustrated with vendors who tried to</font>

438
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:45,560
make instrumentation to do this so we

439
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:47,510
built our own engineering workshop we

440
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,790
got tired of the software as it mostly

441
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:52,580
sucks<font color="#E5E5E5"> in manufacturing it does not do</font>

442
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:58,280
custom very well we I was the proud

443
00:22:52,580 --> 00:23:04,370
owner of 2.4 million lines of Delphi was

444
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:07,700
a good coat but most part it<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it's not</font>

445
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:09,830
again it's not like building a on erp

446
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,530
system where you can take in sku and

447
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:15,070
you're just going to decrement it

448
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:19,420
that's that it's a it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

449
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:22,330
challenging field and DNA<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should</font>

450
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:25,060
include this is a malleable thing so

451
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:28,960
you're not just worried very keen eye to

452
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:32,710
modify it it is stick it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to class or you</font>

453
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:36,310
can build DNA that glows or if it's

454
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:38,890
designed in a specific way it can attach

455
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:41,620
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you its complement very specifically</font>

456
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:44,260
you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> all sorts of crazy things</font>

457
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:46,000
life is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of beautiful like that you</font>

458
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:49,780
can it does all sorts of wonderful

459
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,240
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that makes from an infosec and</font>

460
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:55,060
from an IT perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a very</font>

461
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:58,660
complex problem and it takes some smart

462
00:23:55,060 --> 00:24:02,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">here people who need that that happened</font>

463
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:05,230
I one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my favorite guys the department</font>

464
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:09,280
here's a little man saying this so if

465
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:11,890
you've seen Silicon Valley I've got dude

466
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,230
I don't work with that guy except that

467
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:18,280
he never worn either good black and I

468
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:22,180
hate you<font color="#CCCCCC"> then Holman like slept annually</font>

469
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:24,340
by haha but it was really concert took a

470
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:29,920
lot of weird people who make all this

471
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:32,199
happen in from<font color="#E5E5E5"> again tie it back from a</font>

472
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:36,250
info side perspective all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

473
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:42,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of combine to make a really</font>

474
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:44,950
interesting colouring that built people

475
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:47,680
who had a wide variety of experiences

476
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:49,390
the new stuff and a lot of different

477
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem domains where you have might</font>

00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:52,400
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> amazing is a border person or</font>

479
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:55,100
something

480
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,530
dlp person or something is<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh a very</font>

481
00:24:55,100 --> 00:25:01,370
specific probably delete it kind of had

482
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:06,410
to know a lot about and biology that's

483
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:08,899
the tricky tricky combination so high

484
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:10,580
fix any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this there's the technical</font>

485
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:13,790
bit and I'd love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you that that</font>

486
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:19,159
was like the really hard part but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

487
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:20,720
know I'm sure how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people here call</font>

488
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:24,980
themselves like a technologist like a

489
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:30,650
infosec your checkpoint or a firewall or

490
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:33,950
fire or Sam yeah so um frankly that's

491
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:36,170
it's an awesome prettiful interesting

492
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:38,600
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it that's not really if you're a</font>

493
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:47,300
big nerd I'm a bit hard part of it

494
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:49,669
procedural right don't do this let's

495
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:52,370
teach people to do things in a way that

496
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:54,680
doesn't cause us to ship that tube that

497
00:25:52,370 --> 00:26:01,969
supposed to go to Monsanto to pioneer

498
00:25:54,680 --> 00:26:04,580
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of working with people as</font>

499
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:07,640
that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing in life sciences and</font>

500
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:09,590
and treating people who work in life

501
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:13,010
sciences like idiots is a big mistake

502
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:15,620
they don't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it they're well educated</font>

503
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:17,660
even like the folks that work in

504
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:20,870
manufacturing or in shipping<font color="#E5E5E5"> they all</font>

505
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:22,850
have chemistry degrees so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going in</font>

506
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:26,360
there and telling them like doing it

507
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:29,090
wrong here's a procedure and shop and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

508
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:32,719
that does not get you McIntyre they

509
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:35,090
don't we make their intelligent capable

510
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:38,000
people they don't handle that sort of

511
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:45,260
she incorporated<font color="#E5E5E5"> them very very well ah</font>

512
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:48,380
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's people so keeping people</font>

513
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:52,670
not only explaining what you're supposed

514
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:54,980
to do but why it's employer is is the

515
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:59,390
way that you actually get any of this

516
00:26:54,980 --> 00:27:02,360
done it would be weird for people who

517
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:05,540
came<font color="#E5E5E5"> from outside of this world to come</font>

518
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:07,580
in and they're like well so you know

519
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:09,020
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you what are you doing and if I</font>

520
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:13,100
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> told to do with this play it's like</font>

521
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:14,930
didn't you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

522
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:19,129
know I didn't ask around for the stage

523
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:22,370
sort of idiotic if you breed a culture

524
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:25,850
in biotech where people know to ask why

525
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:28,250
that's how you<font color="#E5E5E5"> defend the gates because</font>

526
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:30,439
if you you don't think that then yeah it

527
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:38,750
was and in all the different<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways</font>

528
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:41,000
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a space and there are upsides all</font>

529
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:43,490
this terrible like this horribly

530
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,139
complicated problem domain right it's

531
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:48,379
you get to learn about a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

532
00:27:45,139 --> 00:27:50,570
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool things if you're being</font>

533
00:27:48,379 --> 00:27:53,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">kit just sort of fascinated by</font>

534
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:56,330
defendants a great world to work in if

535
00:27:53,629 --> 00:27:58,969
you're comfortable with the earth moving

536
00:27:56,330 --> 00:28:01,158
beneath you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's actually why I</font>

537
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:03,139
mean sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> full time leap from life</font>

538
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:08,539
scientists or information security is

539
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:10,519
very comfortable in that it's never<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

540
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:13,190
same and i don't mean that<font color="#CCCCCC"> for my guide</font>

541
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:15,169
I'm lady and I need some new thing it

542
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:18,919
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the world redefines itself</font>

543
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:20,570
over and over and over again life

544
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:23,149
sciences is a very similar thing if

545
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:27,769
you'd like that it's a great challenge

546
00:28:23,149 --> 00:28:31,489
you know the technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> is awesome a lot</font>

547
00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:33,889
of little tools in the pasta<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we get</font>

548
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:36,860
away with it because instead of all

549
00:28:33,889 --> 00:28:42,168
unicorns shoot lasers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that magic</font>

550
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:50,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">shooting there is no pulse so yeah</font>

551
00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:52,460
that's kind of the thing I have begun a

552
00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:54,470
big trouble<font color="#E5E5E5"> with HR</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ones because I</font>

553
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:56,960
included one of my interview questions

554
00:28:54,470 --> 00:29:00,110
what's the airspeed velocity of an

555
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,299
unladen swallow and they're like can't

556
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:05,209
use that anyone like I get the most

557
00:29:02,299 --> 00:29:07,190
awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> in turns out of that question</font>

558
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,960
because I know what they can answer that

559
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:10,909
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> well the answer i made the</font>

560
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:16,159
question is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> long i have for Henry</font>

561
00:29:10,909 --> 00:29:18,500
or European right so the fire it was

562
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:21,350
totally<font color="#CCCCCC"> Zappa civic and we would get</font>

563
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:23,840
people from a back room or like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

564
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:25,939
understand this question I'm really

565
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a really concrete specific</font>

566
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,960
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> right from funny but it's kind of</font>

567
00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:34,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">leading down to a whole group of people</font>

568
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:36,289
that aren't Python hang out with it was

569
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:41,419
so yeah but any questions or

570
00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:46,908
observations but what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very beautiful</font>

571
00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:48,409
and it's busy some specific but you have

572
00:29:46,909 --> 00:29:51,350
to consult our good friends from

573
00:29:48,409 --> 00:29:57,259
Cambridge several<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them were no longer</font>

574
00:29:51,350 --> 00:30:02,509
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a spring break any other peers are</font>

575
00:29:57,259 --> 00:30:03,929
protecting this proprietary what's you

576
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:07,649
find yourself during active

577
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:12,840
fits a lot better each other community
