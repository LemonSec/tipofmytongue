2
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:17,200
good excellent that's what I want to

3
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:19,599
hear so my<font color="#CCCCCC"> name is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Carlos are we talking</font>

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">about Scottish and Stokes I siesta when</font>

5
00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:24,670
attack team's presentation with my buddy

6
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:26,410
at americold earn back so we're just got

7
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,539
to one where a review some information

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,640
up here to this preso is great lunch on

9
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:32,589
basic level so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to scratch</font>

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,089
the surface<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this stuff it's possible</font>

11
00:00:32,589 --> 00:00:36,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">but I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try to give you some</font>

12
00:00:34,089 --> 00:00:39,370
actual information on what the landscape

13
00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:42,699
of state of security and I cs3 is around

14
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:45,250
means of time right trouble times most

15
00:00:42,699 --> 00:00:48,339
of this stuff is easy to understand the

16
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:51,699
conceptual side but once you get deep

17
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,989
into what<font color="#E5E5E5"> ICS and scada is then you're</font>

18
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:55,449
going to get to see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are more</font>

19
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:57,070
things in here that need a little more

20
00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:59,079
of knowledge a little bit more research

21
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:02,829
a little more understanding on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your side</font>

22
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:05,740
right so this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this bro stage in</font>

23
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:07,509
our mind or not my employers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am not by</font>

24
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,500
any means an expert I really want time I

25
00:01:07,509 --> 00:01:10,210
really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn about this stuff</font>

26
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">some always listening to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people i'm</font>

28
00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:16,569
more info on myself so<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much when</font>

kill people or you know destroy the

37
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:39,009
human race so we're good<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go that so</font>

38
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:40,869
the war against the machine we all know

39
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:43,869
how this one ended up right it was an

40
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:45,789
ensemble a prayer chain laughter it was

41
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:48,250
real badly that they took over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff</font>

42
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:50,050
that we had already been<font color="#E5E5E5"> Houston</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

44
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:57,190
wheatbelt a long time ago and ultimately

45
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:59,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">they just came in here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and they took it</font>

46
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:02,679
because it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> so damn in skewered</font>

47
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:05,470
multiple stuff was already in there and

48
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:07,060
was our productive infrastructure

49
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,008
and because of the stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we fail to</font>

50
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,320
recognize once we started working<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

51
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:15,940
that's how the machines took over so how

52
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:18,579
did this happen first<font color="#CCCCCC"> mate aim for our</font>

53
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,980
assembly plants or CR personally place

54
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:24,190
but I was before assembly guys why

55
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:26,440
didn't speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> out then they came out for</font>

56
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:29,710
our water supplies but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had a well in</font>

57
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:32,800
my out so I didn't speak out there

58
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:35,050
thinking more for our energy generation

59
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,520
stuff but I have four pounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> at home and</font>

60
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,520
I didn't speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and then you know</font>

61
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:44,620
what happened they came or the booths

62
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:49,390
man and then I went on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

63
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:52,390
guys the commentary so what have<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

64
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:54,609
let's define<font color="#CCCCCC"> skate on that typical</font>

65
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:56,769
components or number the protocol the

66
00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:00,310
topologies let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> over to the lessons</font>

67
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:03,370
learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> right every month you do you so</font>

68
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:06,670
the terms Scott on in ICS they're used

69
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,920
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mary interchangeably right so let's</font>

70
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:11,079
free ones shut it down to a point and

71
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,268
when do you understand what both are and

72
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,150
we'll take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it from there first of all</font>

73
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:19,540
what is God supervisory control and data

74
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:21,310
acquisition systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> right this stuff if</font>

75
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a great talk by the way on</font>

76
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,510
DEFCON like James are on he pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

77
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,310
set up a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of concept and I took this</font>

78
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:30,040
one to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to you guys right here</font>

79
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:32,530
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are highly distributed systems</font>

80
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,230
that are used when you need a whole

81
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:37,180
bunch of math it happen you plug this

82
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,790
stuff into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hulking server that allows</font>

83
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:42,010
you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do all this math in control I</font>

84
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:46,298
machine<font color="#E5E5E5"> right that's pretty much what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

85
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:48,340
is it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of supervision on a</font>

86
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:51,790
very very broad level and it's actually

87
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:54,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">a small component right and a lot of</font>

88
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:56,679
data acquisition you keep acquiring data

89
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:59,320
to do that supervision but the data is

90
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:03,100
the one that allows you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this stuff</font>

91
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:05,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay examples of this stuff the power</font>

92
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:08,150
grid a nuclear power plant

93
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,489
a distillery a whiskey distillery a

94
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:13,430
brewery it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> even like I why because we</font>

95
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:15,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">got components that's alter temperature</font>

96
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:18,048
pressure and some other stuff on an

97
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:21,349
industrial process aim to keep that in

98
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:25,698
and within certain parameters right so

99
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:27,830
SCADA helps you do that now what is ICS

100
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:30,259
industrial control systems industrial

101
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:33,109
control systems are more<font color="#CCCCCC"> apprise</font>

102
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:35,840
isolated processes that form ax an

103
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:37,759
actual chain of events you start doing

104
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">something then you can pass something</font>

105
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,280
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> for no machine and so on until a</font>

106
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,440
product is finished but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't need</font>

107
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">to keep that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much of control</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over the</font>

108
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,400
whole thing except<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the of them just</font>

109
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,610
yeah the<font color="#E5E5E5"> frequency in which to apply</font>

110
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:56,810
that process to those parts that's how

111
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:59,510
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> define both systems now what are the</font>

112
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:02,389
typical components on one of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2010</font>

113
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:04,969
machines got so good and churning out

114
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:06,349
all these real terminators and all these

115
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,470
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're going to destroy it</font>

116
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:11,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">great first of all there are two basic</font>

stuff you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to lying</font>

126
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:36,919
infrastructure this is the system

changing temperature<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually a motor</font>

133
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:53,330
stuff like that that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much what</font>

00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:57,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">it is these are the basic components on</font>

00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:58,969
an industrial system now let's talk

136
00:05:57,409 --> 00:06:01,129
about system passes

137
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:04,519
this is a stuff that makes it happened

138
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:08,149
like I said first of all plcs go start

actually the ones that are most

most of times look like Italian right

170
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:33,979
it's a component that is sure it comes

190

need pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much looks like an uphill</font>

hooked up to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> team or two component</font>

that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much the graphical form of</font>

process that you can use to control and

00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:47,540
in this case stop right housework first

one of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> processes when you talk</font>

206
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,580
about ladder logic this is pretty much

207
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's inside those components right is</font>

208
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:10,370
this is the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that component</font>

209
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:12,380
needs to follow in order to get

00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:17,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">something to work or something to stop</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">right these conditions not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> breakers</font>

212
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:23,180
start working once they are switched on

00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:25,940
or off depending on their nature right

214
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:28,939
so in this is this process which is

pretty much<font color="#CCCCCC"> a.m. catch a predator the</font>

00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:31,940
communication between 1 and 20 times so

287
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">her purposes of this presentation what I</font>

288
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:36,830
wonderful understand is the two basic

289
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:39,080
protocols for fieldbus are my bus and

290
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:42,020
dnp3<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a little</font>

291
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:45,440
bit about this stuff in a minute or back

292
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:48,380
in you got OPC and I CCP both these

293
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:52,070
protocols are the sign handle the long

294
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:55,280
haul openings between two sites horrible

295
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:58,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm into a comparison between my bus and</font>

296
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,329
the mp3 from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security standpoint I</font>

297
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,340
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some of you guys might know</font>

298
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,900
way more than I do about the face of

299
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:06,110
this stuff but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want you to be aware of</font>

300
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:09,770
what the dangers are in the current

301
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:12,320
statement right modbus initially it's a

302
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:13,939
very rudimentary protocol right and was

303
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,050
supposed to be doing a really simple

304
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:20,480
stuff so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we look at this from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

305
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:22,849
security with the security glass on it

306
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,610
what are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting there is no</font>

307
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:27,050
authentication right there's no one

308
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">ription which means the stuffs pretty</font>

309
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:31,430
much send out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the clear there's</font>

310
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,590
no site with known as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a check so we</font>

311
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:35,150
don't have any means<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> check</font>

312
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:38,120
the integrity of the data that's being

313
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:40,430
sent out there is no broadcast

314
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,470
impression what does that mean within

315
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:46,040
our service immediate announcers thank

316
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:47,420
you very much file transfer it's not an

317
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,339
able on this one so it means that very

318
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:52,490
much you can change stuff from the room

319
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:57,770
come out of normal perspective but let's

320
00:13:52,490 --> 00:14:00,560
look at the mp3 the mp3 does not support

321
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:06,240
an obligation or encryption in its most

322
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:08,069
basic form but if you implement another

323
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm tryna version of this stuff it's</font>

324
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:13,380
called security and<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 then you do have</font>

325
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:16,350
these fake on this important<font color="#CCCCCC"> components</font>

326
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:19,950
but in yellow because they're not being

327
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:23,010
in this work it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> for crc which</font>

doesn't support broadcast suppression

330
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:32,910
which means he's still am because of now

331
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:36,660

being able to change something in the

334
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:45,449
field remotely that's perfectly but the

335
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:47,730
purposes of security<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we do not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoy</font>

336
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:49,560

337
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,450

how we implement this OPC makes

extensive use of become an RPC what does

344
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:17,610
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean that the way that we</font>

two computers is not so secure right the

way that a computer can access something

whole bunch of manuals you can preload

354
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,930
you can just fire them whenever you want

355
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:45,660
and they've been lurking around for

356
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:48,209
years so it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you need to do a</font>

it depends on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows often I'm Clyde in</font>

359
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:55,140
the server so this can be compromised if

00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:58,290
you're using an old or before logging

segregation provides for isolation this

00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:18,350
stuff is definitely a good actors are

434
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:21,379
controlled segregation in this in this

435
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:23,510
case means that you provide a very

436

does as well it's fair<font color="#CCCCCC"> e and many times</font>

00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:57,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">you even get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see the business to UM</font>

448
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:59,780
ask you to link those two networks

449
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,790
because they need me they need some sort

450
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:04,129
of oversight right so once you do that

451
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:05,899
you need to start thinking about those

452
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:08,420
possibilities on how you're going to be

453
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:11,840
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to still secure this network while</font>

with a single egg

456
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:16,920
my point is for you like I said those

457
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,810
things are fair game because they use

458

software to<font color="#E5E5E5"> connect to the network the</font>

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,010
about least route anybody heard about

over here and the rest of the network so

477
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:10,350
if I said the<font color="#CCCCCC"> least amount of network</font>

they are not security and they are nike

they might have a very different<font color="#CCCCCC"> view of</font>

what the network is and what is supposed

out the the process for making a certain

on something it was completely

what I see as we're manipulating

we go to separation between church and

never reach out to those cuts so there

and get those guys in there because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

doesn't and not just help you understand
