00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:22,590
scheduled for probably five

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:26,220
45 we're gonna tell the major that I to

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:34,140
rigging a starter so I have Richard

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:38,610
rushing here to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Star</font>

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:47,129
in their pocket<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

10
00:00:45,449 --> 00:00:52,619
connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> the motorola yeah kind of like</font>

11
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:57,119
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sea so said fair enough so yours</font>

12
00:00:52,619 --> 00:01:00,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thank you very much I'm definite</font>

13
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:02,729
everyone as asking to give a mobile

14
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:06,180
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk and typically you don't</font>

15
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:09,240
get mobile security talks not because I

16
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:12,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't like mobile security it's just you</font>

17
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,548
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into certain areas of oh can we</font>

18
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,950
talk about exploitation<font color="#CCCCCC"> android or iOS</font>

19
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:20,880
and you get all sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things so this</font>

20
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:23,640
is actually kind of a high-level pot

21
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,560
that talks about the issues that you

22
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,469
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> with mobile security and this is</font>

23
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:33,299
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the reasons i deem this the</font>

24
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:35,280
Kobayashi Maru scenario kind of matching

25
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,579
the Star Trek theme it came to me when

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,979
the for those that don't know the

27
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:43,169
Kobayashi Maru scenario it was in the

28
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:46,200
second movie and it basically was an

29
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:49,109
unwinnable scenario there was no way to

30
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,700
win<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in the area about it and mobile</font>

31
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:53,490
security is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very much the same way if</font>

32
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:58,439
your scenario is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make mobile security</font>

33
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:59,939
our mobile devices secure you're not

34
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:02,490
going to be able to win that argument

35
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,960
and well it helps text go talk through

36
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,298
why that actually is

37
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,810
make some suggestions around the area

38
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,459
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> function a minute um a couple of</font>

60
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,810
about exploiting we're typically

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,048
especially when we talk about mobile

62
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:13,739
devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> its predictability and patterns</font>

63
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:16,829
um I love<font color="#CCCCCC"> when people say that they've</font>

64
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:19,019
taken what they want to call anonymized

65
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:21,060
data from mobile devices and think oh

66
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:23,790
we've ran this anonymized data sources

67
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,220
most of those sources when universities

68
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,859
take that data set they can calculate

69
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,650
its no longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> anonymized roughly about</font>

70
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:34,019
anywhere between 68 and eighty percent

71
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,790
of the device information they're able

72
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:38,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">to track back to a single device based</font>

73
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,929
upon patterns we all follow the same

kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of patterns we all follow the same</font>

75
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,730
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of productivity we go to the same</font>

76
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:46,470
train stations of shopping centers or

77
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,260
anything else would use their devices in

78
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:52,049
and around the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same area</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you go home</font>

79
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,269
you still use your devices so if you're

80
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:56,250
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at tracking GPS coordination</font>

81
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:58,019
everything else it's very easy to track

82
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:01,170
an individual device with a high<font color="#CCCCCC"> degree</font>

83
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:04,430
of accuracy just by where it started its

84
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:07,518
day from where it went to and then

85
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:12,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll return to and those are all parts</font>

86
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:16,100
of predictability impacts if you look at

87
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:18,019
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> OSI stack this seven layer stack of</font>

88
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:22,160
that's based on different properties

89
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:24,199
that you go up through until I refer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

90
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,970
it as RF<font color="#CCCCCC"> cargos or radio frequency goes</font>

91
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:31,130
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can put some glasses on and</font>

92
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:34,759
actually see where the signals are going

93
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:38,240
from that in the air<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will never be</font>

94
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:40,130
secure simply do the fact when this

95
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,400
comes up and says I connect you to a

96
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:45,259
cell tower or connected to a Wi-Fi it

97
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,780
may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the access point in the back of</font>

98
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:49,820
the room it may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the access point</font>

99
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:53,090
that's somewhere behind this wall I

100
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,680
don't know I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no idea saying with</font>

101
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:57,138
the cell tower I think it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

102
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's outside down the street but it is</font>

103
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:02,900
no guarantee that it's actually there

104
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:06,859
because RF or radio frequency is about

105
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:09,830
range and power so how far does my

106
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:12,710
single go and then if I want to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

107
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:14,900
signal I have to amplify the reception

108
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,909
of that through an antenna or if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

109
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,010
to transmit to that device that's their

110
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:22,310
time and time again we've seen where

111
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:24,800
RFID or other things like your passport

112
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:27,650
says you have to be less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than six inches</font>

113
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,599
away and the next thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know there</font>

114
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:32,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">is somebody's article that talks about</font>

115
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:36,110
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull off the RFID</font>

116
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:38,870
of people's passport from 30 feet away

117
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:41,360
by using an antenna or pick<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Bluetooth</font>

118
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:44,479
will walk from a mile and a half away

119
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,419
these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> different things that you get</font>

120
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,280
into this as well it's all about<font color="#CCCCCC"> power</font>

121
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:53,030
and all that the functions of that

122
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,070
that's there so mobile devices are

123
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:57,590
really cool

124
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:59,870
I love about<font color="#E5E5E5"> them I can do so many</font>

125
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,549
things so they get cooler every time to

126
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:06,350
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> on there's a huge speed of</font>

127
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:09,590
development process and they do more and

128
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:11,900
more more more data more abilities more

129
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:17,150
capabilities things that are going on

130
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:19,400
the power of devices has grown back when

131
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:24,799
cellular phones were first there the

132
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:27,469
wonders of<font color="#E5E5E5"> gamy was snake just really</font>

boring<font color="#E5E5E5"> lack</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a better term but hey</font>

134
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,760
that is the only thing you have it

135
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:35,000
wasn't anything is on that side<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

they're the same we have networks we

need the storage of devices and storage

the neighborhood of five to seven and in

147
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:08,210
most modern devices that are actually

148
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:11,930
there's some good statistics just data

149
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:13,250
looking at how the buses<font color="#CCCCCC"> I make one</font>

00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:18,050
of people don't realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that they</font>

152
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,610
have a unique characteristic of a really

153
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,380
powerful you just have the same

154
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:24,170
processing capability as list your

modern gaming consoles<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a graphic side</font>

156
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:30,530
and a cpu side so they're really really

157
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:33,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">powerful devices but most of the</font>

158
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:35,599
applications that you're running are

159
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:38,750
talking to other things outside of this

160
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:41,150
device this device is kind of a hub and

161
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,670
it's pulling data down so if you start

162
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:45,200
looking back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this goes back to 2000</font>

00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,880
really

00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,460
hello but you didn't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> that much</font>

170
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:10,810
that's there and the total global

171
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:15,969
traffic was about<font color="#E5E5E5"> one terabyte per month</font>

172
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:19,180
one pair<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my per month back in 2001 so</font>

173
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:21,580
relatively small amounts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data that</font>

174
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:24,490
was there it took almost to the point

175
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:28,510
2002 to we reached 1 billion text

176

179
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:41,829
amazing where we've actually come from

180
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:44,020
into the next area<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can see how</font>

181
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:46,300
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much is just skyrocket almost</font>

182
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:51,189
a logical thing so as you get into it we

183
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:53,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">went to one petabyte around 2007 you had</font>

continue going up you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into more and</font>

00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:30,310
more networks 4G coming out in 2012 we

rolled out so if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's</font>

195
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:35,140
less than four years ago and now we have

talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge amount of data is all</font>

and in some cases insecure not secure

different ways and talk a little bit

208
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,020
more so let's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of break down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

um<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's software it's just like</font>

Microsoft it's just like everybody

217
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,270
else's they have bugs they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> read by</font>

for those<font color="#CCCCCC"> that didn't see in the news</font>

large-scale attacks by stage fright and

226
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,090
some of the others that's the payout for

227
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,280
some of them so they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

228
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:04,980
things better same goes for<font color="#CCCCCC"> apple</font>

229
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,930
introducing their butt bounty program

230
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:10,230
again people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are trying to make this</font>

231
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:12,180
offer better patching you<font color="#E5E5E5"> always have</font>

232
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:14,370
two sides of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> coin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when patches</font>

233

234
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:19,410
them and allow them push to their

235
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,990
devices do they embed other patches and

236
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:24,350
this is the common issue you

237
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:26,600
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> patch it in everything else is do I</font>

238
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,640
roll a lot of patches into the system to

239
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,810
be keep the patch level this<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are</font>

240
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,930
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to catch just the one time</font>

241
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:35,420
capability and don't the maintenance

242
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:37,339
release stuff this there so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> long</font>

243
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">term fragmentations that occur of</font>

244
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:42,260
devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> that go don't get love and care</font>

245
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:44,089
for lack of a better term other devices

246
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:48,800
would get here on a regular basis and

247
00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:50,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">some do better than others some carriers</font>

248
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,930
do better than others<font color="#E5E5E5"> some independent</font>

249
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:55,279
device is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hat on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to carry some</font>

251
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,020
those are forgotten so it's one of the

252
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:05,300
continual areas to focus and<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the</font>

253
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:07,520
things applications are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of slightly</font>

254
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:10,219
weird so I'm talking about applications

255
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:13,939
in this context we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about</font>

256
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:15,920
replacement applications so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

257
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:17,300
replacing their internal application cuz

258
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,430
they want additional features oh my

259
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,630
camera<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to have filter sets or</font>

260
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,790
anything else they'll download new

261
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:27,740
cameras and replace the entire camera

262
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:29,959
which can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be you really good but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

263
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,480
same time on OS hope that becomes really

264
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:34,219
problematic because you're now have to

265
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,890
associate with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and it's typically</font>

266
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:39,920
impersonating some of the other camera

267
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:43,069
capabilities so it's kind of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

268
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,380
on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC you set something to default so</font>

269
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:47,300
anytime I see this file always open up

270
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:49,520
this application and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe not the</font>

271
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:52,130
case and sometimes that causes problems

272
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:56,149
inside the devices one of the biggest

273
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:58,910
issues that things have is dealing with

274
00:12:56,149 --> 00:13:01,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">routing or jailbreaking devices so I</font>

275
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:04,699
take a device that's designed to have

276
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:08,510
some levels of security and when I break

277
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:12,140
it through jailbreaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> or I rooted I</font>

278
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:14,360
take that security level<font color="#E5E5E5"> away so</font>

279
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,519
everything runs with full permissions

280
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,680
everything run is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in using time and</font>

281
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:21,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">time again malware that focuses on</font>

282
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:23,779
jailbroken phones and routing from

283
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,279
because in a lot of cases that's of

284
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:28,820
around twenty percent of the market

285
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:31,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">share and a lot of times it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just done</font>

286
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:34,100
because people think they need that

287
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:36,949
capability and in most cases right now

288
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">the used to be the biggest argument list</font>

289
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:40,730
for tethering capability inside of

290
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:43,790
carriers because some carriers charge

291
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:46,490
you for different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> for tethering</font>

292
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:49,490
you most of those have temps went away

293
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:51,230
and went oh so the need for jailbreaking

294
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:53,540
and some of the other ones has kind of

295
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:56,360
dropped off but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> never know where</font>

296
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:58,819
it's there the phones do have more

297
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,680
protection than your PC's do they

298
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,779
operated<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these privileged mode with</font>

00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:05,870
accounts they also operate in a sandbox

300
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:07,760
environment they also operate in enough

301
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:10,490
permission level so when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an app</font>

302
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,990
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can tell what actually 22 which if</font>

303
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:14,720
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as much different than</font>

304
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:16,399
the PC people always ask it's like how

305
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,959
cell phones<font color="#E5E5E5"> are so insecure and I'm like</font>

306
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:22,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're much more secure than any</font>

307
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:24,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">Windows environment or in a conveyor in</font>

308
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:26,720
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases just because the</font>

309
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:32,839
capabilities that are built around back

310
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:36,199
native operating systems now one of the

311
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:40,370
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these devices communicate</font>

312
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:43,130
over is a cellular networks so<font color="#CCCCCC"> cellular</font>

313
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:46,160
networks been around for a while but

314
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:52,070
it's been around for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> while it's older</font>

315
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:54,170
protocols gsm was an older protocol that

316
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:57,649
had been<font color="#E5E5E5"> around forever and they</font>

317
00:14:54,170 --> 00:15:00,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically figured out how to crypt it</font>

318
00:14:57,649 --> 00:15:04,579
just like all cryptology after a while

319
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:07,279
it's weak and this is same case but as

320
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:09,020
people were like oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can now have a</font>

321
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,910
conversation and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't</font>

322
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:13,490
so your conversation as it goes across

323
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:16,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">the airwaves become gsm so people</font>

324
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:18,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">naturally moved off of gsm into some of</font>

325
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:22,970
the others from A to G to the 3g

326
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:28,880
environment but as in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> carrier's if</font>

327
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:31,550
I'm out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of range too far away my 2g</font>

328
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:35,180
networks travel farther than my 3gs

329
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:37,280
agains the idea of power and range so

330
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:39,530
there was always backwards compatibility

331
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,600
I had a row<font color="#CCCCCC"> I connected</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to things so</font>

332
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:43,939
that backwards compatibility typically

333
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">meant your device you either tricked</font>

334
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:50,420
into connecting to a 2g network or if

335
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,280
the network wasn't available or your

336
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:55,910
network said hey it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really congested</font>

340
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:06,050
entities on the cell towers and

341
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,480
everything else it's like Hello and some

342
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:10,219
targets hello there's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said lots</font>

343
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,890
of data and you go now you shouldn't

wear<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you can or yeah I'm free and</font>

345
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:17,420
you have there's a conversation that

346
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:20,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">goes whoa stop there's other people here</font>

347
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:22,910
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wait your turn there's a whole</font>

348
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,620
sets of protocols that are actually done

349

on them<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the carrier controlled and</font>

350
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:29,600
this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that they take</font>

00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:32,780
advantage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that if I pretend to be a</font>

00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:39,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">five hundred dollars and parts to be</font>

a hundred thousand dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big truck</font>

00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:51,080
lots of things now five hundred dollars

00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:53,090
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> PC and you're good so the portion of</font>

358
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:56,660
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that able to say hey how is the</font>

359
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:58,850
statue at work and the carriers have

360
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:01,790
always had lots of control<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the</font>

361
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:02,700
devices if you travel you had software

362
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,170
always download

00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:07,500
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your device when you came to another</font>

365
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,859
over to somebody somebody says hey

366
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:12,630
there's my roaming profile<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this onto</font>

your<font color="#E5E5E5"> device that you know how to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> operate</font>

368
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:20,459
in my network so you've always kind of

369
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:23,819
trusted this carriers but now I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

370
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:26,820
capability to be a carrier for you your

371
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:29,280
phone in your device explicitly trust me

372
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:31,290
in a lot of cases with that and

373
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes people take advantage of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

374
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:36,149
through authentication which she calls

375
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,719
you solve one last week or somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

376
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:43,020
like hey I didn't buy a sim yet I was

377
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the text or voice or data</font>

378
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:47,460
and all three of those have different

379
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:49,800
sets of controls in some cases voice

380
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,210
will always work if you take your<font color="#E5E5E5"> stem</font>

381
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,490
out of your phone it says you can still

382
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:58,590
make emergency calls in a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases</font>

383
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:59,880
but you shouldn't I can this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is part of</font>

384
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,919
the some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues that are there</font>

385
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,540
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> text through the kind of the</font>

386
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,860
next level up and data<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the final</font>

387
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,990
level this is yeah there's different

388
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,990
levels that I allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to operate and</font>

389
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:12,150
everything else um you<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have the</font>

390
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:13,980
cell towers themselves how they operate

391
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:16,710
some of those operate as a local<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

392
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:19,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">so in other words if everybody's here</font>

393
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:23,160
and everybody's devices are connected to

394
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:25,169
a particular a can t cell tower all

395
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,360
those devices kind of operating can

396
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:29,250
communicate in some cases back and forth

397
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,520
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pure pure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of level inside that</font>

398
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:34,950
environment because of the network the

399
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:39,990
way is actually set up there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a</font>

400
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:44,160
lot of cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> where the ss7 switching</font>

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">exploited and looked at of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Haluk towers</font>

403
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:53,460
do handoffs how the towers talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

404
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:55,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">get with that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it cell phones are</font>

405
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,860
actually really remarkable we take a lot

406
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">for granted</font>

407
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,159
my phone and call somebody somewhere

408
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:03,370
anywhere in the world and get an answer

409
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,710
and drive down the road at 60 miles an

410
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:07,540
hour and it goes from one color to the

411
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:10,540
next hour to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next hour to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

412
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:13,210
hour and typically doesn't necessarily

413
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:16,420
drop the cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes it does but</font>

414
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:18,790
that's truly remarkable as you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

415
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:20,500
try to do the traffic analysis hey how

416
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:23,409
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it go from here and then also it</font>

417
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,360
appears five miles down the road and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

418
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:32,470
still maintains that and you don't hear

419
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:34,780
anything communication is still there so

420
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:36,460
now we looked at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cell your side of</font>

421
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:38,320
it OS let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at the</font>

422
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:40,660
applications<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

423
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,149
applications are<font color="#CCCCCC"> tricky why because</font>

424
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:45,880
their applications not really written by

425
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:47,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">the manufacturers some cases they are</font>

426
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,630
but most a month array by third parties

427
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:53,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">or other people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or other organizations</font>

428
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:56,799
um so you always have the rogue

429
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:59,440
applications that you can do so any of

430
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,450
the applications that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to I can</font>

431
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,000
pull out of the phone or off the

432
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:06,309
marketplace and typically make

433
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,950
modifications and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then put them back</font>

434
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:10,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the marketplace or come back into a</font>

435
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:12,549
website<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's actually there I can take</font>

436
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:15,490
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are branded to somebody else</font>

437
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:19,330
bring them on and brand them as myself

438
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:24,520
hey this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is Rich's camera it's not I</font>

439
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:26,470
just stole it and decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sell it use</font>

440
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:30,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">it leverage it as something else it's</font>

441
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:36,760
actually there um so that's always that

442
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:39,309
issue with rogue applications in the

different things in lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases it's</font>

449
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:56,460
like your flashlight<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just turn on</font>

450
00:20:55,299 --> 00:21:00,270
and off my camera flash

for anything but over permission is

453
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:08,610
really really common both for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:12,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay i want to track of this or I want</font>

456
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,659
to do malicious things I might use your

457
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,460
phone to do conscious things like click

458
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,990
fraud and some of the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font>

459
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,060
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually there because it's mobile</font>

460
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:22,380
people ask why<font color="#CCCCCC"> why do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font>

461
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,570
her with my thumb why would you do it

462
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:28,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">myself it's mold it constantly changes</font>

463
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:30,270
IP addresses to it can get two different

464
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">things almost any point in time it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

465
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:35,310
no barriers to stop it in a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases</font>

466
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:37,710
so it's kind of the perfect thing when I

467
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:40,290
want to do kind of things that I wanted

468
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:42,150
to be malicious on butter sighs go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

469
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:43,980
open pages and things like that all

470
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:51,450
behind the scenes that you never see

471
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:53,970
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm actually doing so sometimes</font>

472
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:56,190
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> do things sometimes apps are</font>

473
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:58,950
created that we all remember this

474
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:02,970
snapchat hey we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> save your pictures</font>

475
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:06,180
oh sorry we kind of do not our fault

476
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:09,450
forgive us it's there a lot of

477
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:10,950
applications on Android and some of the

478
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,360
other words you select databases to

479
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:13,740
store their data in a sequel light and

480
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,500
everything else they dump everything in

481
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,850
there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh it's obvious cated you</font>

482
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,130
can't figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out and make the keys</font>

483
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:22,080
are in it happens it's like 30 seconds

484
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:25,500
to code like oh look here's everything

485
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:29,310
that's there I've access to it so a lot

486
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:32,760
of times the application vendors do not

487
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:35,100
go back excuse me do not go with the

488
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:37,140
idea that this is an insecure platform

489
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,360
they go with<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get at this pure platform</font>

490
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:41,100
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to lose your phone and</font>

491
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,350
your phone as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I to know when you</font>

492
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:46,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">get to the data except that's</font>

493
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:49,290
unfortunately not the way you should be

494
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:51,419
really creating things the second area

495
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:54,510
for application issues is<font color="#E5E5E5"> typically</font>

496
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:55,800
where do these devices talk so you think

497
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:57,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it it's like well where these</font>

498
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,919
device is talking with

499
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:02,410
why do they talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you to everything</font>

500
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:04,120
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how do they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk the number one</font>

501
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:07,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can typically find in the</font>

502
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">apps talk a lot they talk in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clear text</font>

503
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:13,120
they send crap all over the place

504
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:15,070
everything from your imei two distinct

505
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,959
pieces of parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the information that</font>

506
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:19,780
you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want shouldn't be</font>

507
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:23,320
disclosed for any given these shapes our

508
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:25,450
capabilities but they do it just because

509
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,700
hey that's there hey if you enter this

510
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:30,790
information in this stays if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I enter a</font>

511
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:32,650
credit card in here maybe it's that

512
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:34,060
keeps it here or maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it keeps it on</font>

513
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:36,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">the website where does it actually</font>

514
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:38,889
storing the data and we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> this on</font>

515
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,520
different areas the question is is

516
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:45,460
leaking just an accident or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a privacy</font>

517
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:47,710
issue or is it just on purpose The Hague

518
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:49,240
we can get ahead of this and do

519
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:52,390
different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are actually there</font>

520
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:56,680
this is probably the biggest issue

521
00:23:52,390 --> 00:24:00,010
that's actually there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the apps that</font>

522
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:03,670
are receiving this data are relatively

523
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:06,879
for lack of a better term not very

524
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:08,470
security tested phone ability

525
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,020
assessments penetration<font color="#CCCCCC"> tests or</font>

526
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:13,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything else because it's mobile it's</font>

527
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:16,690
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like hey this reports to em</font>

528
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:19,060
snapchat<font color="#CCCCCC"> calm which is not just</font>

529
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:21,070
something else and these applications

530
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:22,480
are not necessarily tied together we see

531
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:24,760
this time to time again where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

532
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,530
see hey this was broken<font color="#E5E5E5"> into through the</font>

533
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,840
mobile app and not the website<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

534
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:32,320
website<font color="#E5E5E5"> was checked and checked and</font>

535
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:34,330
reach a the mobile app not so much or

536
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,020
the server that's supporting the mobile

537
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:40,070
app not so much

538
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:42,050
authentication is really important how

539
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:44,000
many times<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we selected hey I want</font>

540
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:45,590
to authenticate for facebook or I wanna

541
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,550
think it through any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these other</font>

542
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:51,590
sources and we do it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the web we do it</font>

543
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:53,389
on mobile apps that again parts of the

544
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:55,699
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are there sometimes those</font>

545
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:57,890
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually stored into the phone</font>

546
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,360
itself which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I get access</font>

547
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:02,090
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone I get access to your</font>

548
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:06,350
credentials and can leverage then use

549
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:08,990
those these illusions their marketplace

550
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:13,129
issues are also super common

551
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:14,540
marketplaces are kind of weird very much

552
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:17,660
now since we have two flavors of

553
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:25,340
operating systems we have google<font color="#E5E5E5"> play</font>

554
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:28,130
store itunes for<font color="#CCCCCC"> apple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's there to</font>

555
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:31,669
be perfectly<font color="#E5E5E5"> honest people are now we're</font>

556
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:33,560
so awful most of the malware always

557
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:35,660
comes from untrusted<font color="#E5E5E5"> sources there are</font>

558
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:37,909
few exceptions where malware is

559
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:41,630
downloaded from the market places but

560
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:44,030
those are much rarer than that<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you</font>

561
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:45,710
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the volume of downloads and</font>

562
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:48,590
everything else that actually occurring

563
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:50,630
it's a much lower percentage than your

564
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:52,280
average see you think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you</font>

565
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:54,890
get pc from it's like you don't even get

566
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:56,840
to choose a marketplace go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

567
00:25:54,890 --> 00:26:01,310
internet and go on to google and say hey

568
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:04,669
I'm looking for adobe flash player

569
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:09,020
kicking you the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten links they're</font>

570
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:11,390
all malware those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> areas are</font>

571
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:13,220
there the marketplaces did have issues

572
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:15,110
when they first got established everyone

573
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:18,500
wanted it the<font color="#E5E5E5"> carrier's wanted their</font>

574
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:20,060
pieces of the marketplace the providers

575
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,560
wanted their piece of the marketplace

576
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:24,980
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted their piece of the</font>

577
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:28,310
topic to monetize your cell phone usage

578
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:30,440
the problem was that<font color="#CCCCCC"> gone in most of</font>

579
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,770
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> are free or cost a little bit in</font>

580
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,170
there

581
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:35,600
not that much generation on that side of

582
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:37,820
it's almost the<font color="#CCCCCC"> marketplaces</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guide or</font>

583
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:42,050
they kind of core less into a hey here's

584
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:45,470
just our<font color="#CCCCCC"> t-mobile</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> toolset or our verizon</font>

585
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:47,060
tools not anything else that's on those

586
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">sides what we're trying to sell other</font>

587
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:50,480
things on the market places<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

588
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">there and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then some of the marketplaces</font>

589
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,340
just got really out of control and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

590
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:57,110
anybody could put anything on there

591
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:59,270
which must go to time ended up being

592
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:02,360
malware most of the marketplaces now

593
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:04,129
have code review kind of they'll go in

594
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,600
and statically and look at the staff and

595
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,920
say hey we've seen this before<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

596
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,699
doesn't look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> any other application</font>

597
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:13,910
if it does well will flag it if it

598
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:16,670
doesn't then it goes on and it keeps the

599
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:18,320
applications and keeps the things in the

600
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:21,110
marketplace pretty much secure it will

601
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,639
bounce anything that's not developers of

602
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:24,889
your new developer is kind of a

603
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,300
reputation based hey have you a couple

604
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:28,850
of this stuff before<font color="#CCCCCC"> train be done and</font>

605
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">how you wanted it up there are some</font>

606
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:32,480
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> say hey there's a static code</font>

607
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:34,760
review done where people look at the

608
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,400
code that's really not the case we see

609
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,830
come again where there is definitely bad

610
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,900
and evil code that people were got

611
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:43,879
really just<font color="#E5E5E5"> came</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with that's there</font>

612
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:46,310
now one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things that do want to</font>

613
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:51,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you is that if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I put code in there</font>

614
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:53,929
to say go out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> XYZ server calm and</font>

615
00:27:51,350 --> 00:28:00,409
download an ad stream or download

616
00:27:53,930 --> 00:28:02,540
something the code is still good that

617
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:05,330
server that you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> download the</font>

618
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:07,100
information from get bad so a lot of the

619
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:08,689
bad applications people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are talking</font>

620
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:12,469
about and putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> on different sites</font>

621
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:14,480
they look perfectly good but in six<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

622
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:17,450
eight<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks that server that you're</font>

623
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,980
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now turn evil and start sending</font>

624
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:20,930
stuff into your<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that's like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

625
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:24,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">gotta pop up now what's this about where</font>

626
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:26,960
is this or icon will appear magically<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

627
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,720
your device so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the areas</font>

628
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,970
that you get into the stair and there

629
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:34,910
are evil applications they target things

630
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:36,230
like keyboard translations other things

631
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:39,590
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are downloaded say hey</font>

632
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:42,679
if I can watch what you're typing that's

633
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:45,110
perfect don't have to do anything else

634
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:49,340
so hey I can speed you're taiking up by

635
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:52,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">25 percent we have a very sophisticated</font>

636
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:54,439
keyboard keys swell according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your</font>

637
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:57,980
typing characteristics people like wow

638
00:28:54,440 --> 00:29:00,440
cool yeah unfortunately yeah as that

639
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:02,600
streaming is taking all this data and

640
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,940
sending it to a server in Russia which

641
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:09,590
is now partially putting all your stuff

642
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:11,690
back together when<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my own gentleman</font>

643
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:14,809
from trusted sources do not ever

644
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:17,150
download any application from any

645
00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:20,149
sources and try to site loaded which is

646
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:22,370
basically has loaded it that will cause

647
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:26,360
you to brief at some point of time they

648
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:27,949
all do and most<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time everybody is</font>

649
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,350
now trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to push things to the</font>

650
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:33,200
marketplace go here go here go here you

651
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:34,969
go to Amazon you can go to Google you

652
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">can go to iTunes and you'll find the</font>

653
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:39,140
same stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pokemon go with a perfect</font>

654
00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:41,450
example of this when they had to rush

655
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:43,760
and it was being slowly released there

656
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:46,130
were so many bad versions of its looking

657
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,600
around that there were so many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

658
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:50,120
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> got their phone zone because they</font>

659
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,379
get a loaded a bad version that's

660
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,449
actually there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when you get your</font>

661
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:56,390
phone on people like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah how do I never</font>

662
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:59,600
so point most of this stuff is we're

663
00:29:56,390 --> 00:30:01,190
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> designed just to sit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on top</font>

664
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">of everything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and suck everything else</font>

665
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:05,330
off doesn't care about what you're there

666
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:06,668
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for bank accounts is looking</font>

667
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:08,559
for things that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to type</font>

668
00:30:06,669 --> 00:30:10,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's looking for password potentials</font>

669
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:13,210
another thing it's whole purpose is just

670
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:16,960
to sit quietly<font color="#CCCCCC"> by listen to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you do</font>

671
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:18,970
it send it someplace<font color="#E5E5E5"> else not really to</font>

672
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,220
say hey I want to annoy you i want two

673
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:22,629
things start<font color="#E5E5E5"> control things or do</font>

674
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:26,169
different things that are actually there

675
00:30:22,629 --> 00:30:28,090
now if you look in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual device</font>

676
00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:30,580
there are some specifics that go with

677
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:32,529
every device you have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> radios so</font>

678
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:37,539
there's multiple sets of radio<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bluetooth</font>

679
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:39,369
NFC Wi-Fi cellular all the radios have

680
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:42,009
device issues there's an exploit in

681
00:30:39,369 --> 00:30:44,830
Wi-Fi for the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> blade</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bluetooth guess</font>

682
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:46,720
what it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be vulnerable in a</font>

683
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:49,059
discussion it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it's not like it's</font>

684
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:52,899
running some special software that's not

685
00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:55,239
horrible if this protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> is exploit so</font>

686
00:30:52,899 --> 00:30:59,018
anytime you see that regardless<font color="#CCCCCC"> you like</font>

687
00:30:55,239 --> 00:31:00,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok emotion her blew you off other</font>

688
00:30:59,019 --> 00:31:03,340
capabilities<font color="#E5E5E5"> their their external</font>

689
00:31:00,999 --> 00:31:05,559
interfaces are also key<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't mind me</font>

690
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:11,379
better as yeah we use our USB is

691
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:15,070
charging but since it's also us in other

692
00:31:11,379 --> 00:31:17,799
words if you have malware on it some of

693
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:21,100
the more prolific now where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the copies</font>

694
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:23,259
itself to<font color="#E5E5E5"> share drives and USB keys and</font>

695
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:27,158
everything else Oh copy itself to the

696
00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:28,840
phone won't infect the phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

697
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:30,850
designed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to infect a VC but when you're</font>

698
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:35,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">I need to charge my phone and plug the</font>

699
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:38,168
USB in oh there's your pc and then every

700
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:39,850
other person<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can give to you go to</font>

701
00:31:38,169 --> 00:31:42,399
the charging station at the airport put

702
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:44,019
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in you potentially and set that as</font>

703
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,248
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so there's all sorts of different</font>

704
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:47,409
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are actually there</font>

705
00:31:45,249 --> 00:31:49,389
especially on external interfaces that

706
00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:50,500
are there teach you the interfaces

707
00:31:49,389 --> 00:31:52,780
always have a deep

708
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:55,480
which gives you direct access onto the

709
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:57,639
device doesn't matter of the devices all

710
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,590
sets and devices have it debug mode it's

711
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:02,860
either enable or not enabled by default

712
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:05,050
and enabling it you give your device a

713
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:07,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of control through that USB channel</font>

714
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:09,820
I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> not recommend doing that on a</font>

715
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:12,070
regular basis it's really cool if it's

716
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:15,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">have got all these additional things you</font>

717
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:18,429
never use them you're not w memory or

718
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:20,470

732
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:55,240
read that SD card with that phone not

733
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:56,740
anything else it doesn't go hey can you

736
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:04,300
the guy that does it so you have this

737
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,760
kind of issue when you're trying to

738
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:09,040
transfer data in and out so most of the

739
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:11,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">times people transfer data via either</font>

742
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:23,500
that's their<font color="#E5E5E5"> pin lock or any kind of</font>

00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:29,560
facial better than nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> do never</font>

745
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:33,040
leave your phone with no lock code ever

746
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:33,820
that's it simply do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that that</font>

747
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,050
means

748
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:37,360
that in case you get pics up your phone

749
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:39,310
has complete access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it unless</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> put anything on your phone which I</font>

751
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:44,980
find really hard and people I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

752
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:46,689
anything on my phone good I take<font color="#E5E5E5"> it here</font>

753
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:49,780
and hit it with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hammer you won't have</font>

754
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:51,790
any loss and you watch people and like

755
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:53,410
no you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that fine well oh my god</font>

756
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:55,270
that way we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have stuff on here you</font>

757
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:57,100
always what<font color="#CCCCCC"> hap stuff it doesn't matter</font>

758
00:33:55,270 --> 00:34:00,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you I don't like my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

y'all going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all my contacts um</font>

760
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:05,980
there's also other<font color="#CCCCCC"> budo protections so</font>

761
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:08,920
if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it from a boot up</font>

762
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:10,179
perspective if my device prompts me for

763
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:12,700
a password what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that really mean</font>

764
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:15,520
well if somehow my device has ever get

765
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:18,189
turned off and then it turned back on

766
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,259
you want it to prompt you for a pen or a

767
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:23,679
diagnostic before it comes to pull me up

768
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:26,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">simply just do the fact it's that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

769
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,989
nothing gets loaded onto a before it

770
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,699
does there's a security level that's

771
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:33,459
actually there that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font>

772
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:35,529
usually has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in typically go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hey</font>

773
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:38,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">just boot up without having to recognize</font>

774
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:40,930
a pen for that but the idea behind it is

775
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:42,819
that if my phone is over powered down or

776
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:45,250
lost or with anything else I can get the

777
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:47,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">information back one of the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> areas</font>

778
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:49,179
that is they're mostly operating

779
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:51,460
environments are going to a TPM type

780
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:54,969
interface safe stone from<font color="#E5E5E5"> qualcomm</font>

781
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:58,510
chipsets and other thing which trusted

782
00:34:54,969 --> 00:35:00,910
platform is basically an idea that says

783
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:02,950
hey think of it as a safe I can stick

784
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:06,040
stuff in here no one can get it out

785
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:08,049
except for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me I know the combination I</font>

786
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,790
can pull it out at any point in<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and</font>

787
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:11,320
use it but I'm only<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use it</font>

788
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:14,140
inside this asian that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i might like to</font>

789
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:16,870
see so you have that capability it is

790
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:18,549
very quick<font color="#CCCCCC"> and very most of the software</font>

791
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:20,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">is there it hasn't</font>

792
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:24,550
up to the hardware component yet so

793
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:27,070
Qualcomm is using one kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of area p.m.</font>

794
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:28,780
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of other areas that are</font>

795
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:31,000
kind of you focused eventually they'll

796
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:33,040
put a TPM chip on the thing just like

797
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,530
most of your laptops have TPM chip sign

798
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:38,890
so if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do a biometric on my</font>

799
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:41,020
laptop it's set on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> side of it so</font>

800
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:43,029
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the areas that you get</font>

801
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:46,120
into on a regular basis that's a little

802
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:47,650
better there's a popular idea that

803
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:51,850
people like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say is the halo I can</font>

804
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:56,590
bring my own<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices to work yeah you</font>

805
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:58,330
can I don't know if it gives you benefit

806
00:35:56,590 --> 00:36:00,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that say oh this</font>

807
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:03,160
is great no it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> other so many</font>

808
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:05,650
hurdles to jump through<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's their idea</font>

809
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">behind it is hey you're accessing</font>

811

815
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:20,530
that and this is some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff that</font>

gets into<font color="#CCCCCC"> her limit to support costs</font>

functions usually driven by cost with

819
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:29,800
other things sometimes it's maulin

820

validation um connected device issues

860
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:21,520
are always there your phone's connect

861
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:23,589
everything thus also the weakest link

862
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,990
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times it's like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hey I</font>

863
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:27,670
trust my phone and when you program it

864
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:30,279
for your car it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like hey you want me</font>

865
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:31,600
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember your phone and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then the</font>

866
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:35,950
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing we heart is like downloading</font>

867
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:38,140
all your contacts the number would throw

868
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:39,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">Barlow got into and went up I hope</font>

869
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:44,589
everybody's contacts let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> make some</font>

870
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:46,180
phone calls because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does it's just</font>

871
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:48,820
that way the connected device you have a

872
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:51,069
transfer of trust and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually</font>

873
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:55,059
through some little mint yes or no yes

874
00:38:51,069 --> 00:38:57,130
done as I transfer trust I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

875
00:38:55,059 --> 00:39:00,819
my phone to unlock my house not a chance

876
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:02,140
ever on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that side of but it's part of</font>

877
00:39:00,819 --> 00:39:03,640
the thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> like yeah I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able</font>

878
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:06,339
to have an app on my phone that go to

879
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:08,558
garage I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to apple my phone that</font>

880
00:39:06,339 --> 00:39:10,449
tells<font color="#E5E5E5"> me things there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one beers of</font>

881
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:12,910
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> go on in a connected</font>

882
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:15,459
environment between the house the home

883
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:18,308
the apartment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there are so many cool</font>

884
00:39:15,459 --> 00:39:20,109
things you can do just understand the

885
00:39:18,309 --> 00:39:22,209
security implications of when you're

886
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:25,029
doing that and always think about are

887
00:39:22,209 --> 00:39:27,969
you transferring trust from one place to

888
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:29,559
the next because if you are you can go

889
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:31,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">back to the simple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing shouldn't there</font>

890
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:33,309
be some kind of authentication shouldn't

891
00:39:31,749 --> 00:39:35,738
<font color="#E5E5E5">there be something and maybe there is</font>

892
00:39:33,309 --> 00:39:42,339
maybe it's all behind the scenes or

893
00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:45,670
really maybe it's a four digit<font color="#CCCCCC"> PIN with</font>

894
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:47,949
that and again managing your wife and

895
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:50,890
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get worse before it gets</font>

896
00:39:47,949 --> 00:39:55,569
better one thing key takeaways on this

897
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:58,390
is that if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at around 20 19 the</font>

898
00:39:55,569 --> 00:40:01,150
number of connected devices connected to

899
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:05,589
get will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the amount of global</font>

900
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:07,509
internet traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was in 2012 so the</font>

901
00:40:05,589 --> 00:40:09,549
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information that in shared</font>

902
00:40:07,509 --> 00:40:12,819
through these connected devices

903
00:40:09,549 --> 00:40:15,130
somewhere in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so distant future</font>

904
00:40:12,819 --> 00:40:21,308
will actually be the size<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

905
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:23,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet three years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago so into</font>

906
00:40:21,309 --> 00:40:25,239
conclusions on this there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are lots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

907
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:29,739
different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can do I</font>

908
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:34,329
really wish there was like hey this is

909
00:40:29,739 --> 00:40:36,400
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> perfect solution there's not a good</font>

910
00:40:34,329 --> 00:40:38,620
perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution</font>

911
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,050
there's not anything that's actually

912
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:43,509
point across so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you think about it</font>

913
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:46,420
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> going back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the original idea if</font>

914
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:49,270
you're playing the game that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a</font>

915
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:51,460
no-win scenario i can choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> not to play</font>

916
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:53,530
so i take my mobile device and take a

917
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:56,410
hammer and smash it that's not going to

918
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:58,750
happen I like my mobile device so what

919
00:40:56,410 --> 00:41:00,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">are you going to be left to do I have to</font>

920
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:02,710
do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some levels of</font>

921
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:07,960
controls and someone will aspect to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

922
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:11,890
look indigenous so it's easy you cheat I

923
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:14,050
know that's bad term but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

924
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:15,730
know I know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I go into and I'm not</font>

925
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:19,300
going to go into a scenario where I'm

926
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:21,910
not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> win so in some cases i know</font>

927
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:24,640
my device is not secure so I treated

928
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:27,730
definitely I<font color="#E5E5E5"> questioned anything that</font>

929
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:30,970
comes off of this device may or may not

930
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:33,640
be potentially mine at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time I</font>

931
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:35,589
have controls around this device where I

932
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:38,589
know what went into it I know what

933
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:41,050
applications came on to it I know what

934
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:43,600
I'm actually connected to and I don't

935
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:46,000
just connect<font color="#CCCCCC"> and any open Wi-Fi network</font>

936
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:48,220
I don't connect at me<font color="#CCCCCC"> strange into the</font>

937
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,500
network I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be turned on</font>

938
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:54,939
when I'm not using<font color="#E5E5E5"> my bluetooth headset</font>

939
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:58,330
or my<font color="#E5E5E5"> bar it's just normal best</font>

940
00:41:54,940 --> 00:42:00,040
practices of doing something is amiss so

941
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:02,410
caught up in this that you walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> away</font>

942
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,880
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're no longer here or I think</font>

943
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:06,759
hey this is really cool I don't want to

944
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:09,880
type in my four digit<font color="#CCCCCC"> PIN that's so hard</font>

945
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:12,280
do I really seriously four digits is

946
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:14,650
really hard for you to get a remember or

947
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:17,740
take the time to actually type no it's

948
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:19,720
not get over because if you don't I'm

949
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:22,959
going on your phone you're going to own

950
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:25,899
your wife because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> consequences are I</font>

951
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:29,680
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> access</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to everything this is kind</font>

952
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:31,610
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your wallet so if you allow me access</font>

953
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:34,370
to your wallet<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I can make it</font>

954
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:36,380
copy of it I can beat you really really

955
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:38,750
really easy faster than anything else

956
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:42,500
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what the criminals are after is</font>

957
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:44,390
this because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do research</font>

958
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:46,430
I don't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go in and try to guess</font>

959
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:50,390
your bank account information on it's

960
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:52,970
all there so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issue that you</font>

961
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:55,490
run into a simple thing of not doing

962
00:42:52,970 --> 00:43:24,500
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just getting the complete</font>

963
00:42:55,490 --> 00:43:26,689
access to your life if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are um good</font>

964
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:28,460
question there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of lots of</font>

965
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:31,700
protections and I think part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

966
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:36,110
protections are kind of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do with</font>

967
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:39,439
your phone I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big believer in</font>

968
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:43,700
mobile malware if you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> your apps from</font>

969
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:46,580
reputable sources you don't need mobile

970
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:48,770
malware but if you're downloading every

971
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:51,020
other camera app because you're looking

972
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:54,080
for some feature film when you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

973
00:43:51,020 --> 00:44:00,800
have 40,000 apps on your phone yes you

974
00:43:54,080 --> 00:44:03,170
need mobile malware um depends on the

975
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:06,740
operating side on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that side up whether</font>

976
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:08,990
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android or iOS Android side lookout</font>

977
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:12,620
is probably one of the better ones to

978
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:14,540
leverage<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that side and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again what's</font>

979
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:16,310
the operating systems now<font color="#CCCCCC"> psycho</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> view</font>

980
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:19,550
malware and what we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> do all this</font>

981
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:23,900
other stuff Oh your permissions and

982
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:24,710
things that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's not</font>

983
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:27,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything that</font>

984
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:30,290
there that's gets on that side of it if

985
00:44:27,859 --> 00:44:32,119
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> very sophisticated you can always</font>

986
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:36,290
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> buy our school now</font>

987
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:38,780
has all the schemas for mobile apps in

988
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:40,369
there as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you can scan for a hash</font>

989
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:42,349
put it up in there and go hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

990
00:44:40,369 --> 00:44:44,570
anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before oh this is bad</font>

991
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:46,400
and we've seen apps from the cellular

992
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:56,240
providers that turn bad over the periods

993
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:57,710
of yours as well so um some of that some

994
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:01,640
of the sofa<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff is actually pretty</font>

995
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:04,609
good some of the other stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets into</font>

996
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:06,319
some of the other areas the apple stuff

997
00:45:04,609 --> 00:45:08,270
is really from the jailbroken scoffs

998
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:11,930
