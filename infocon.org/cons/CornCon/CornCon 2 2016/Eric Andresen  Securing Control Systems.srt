1
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:29,349
well part you're not going to care right

2
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:31,448
<font color="#E5E5E5">because there's two basic things that</font>

3
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:35,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have in the control system really I</font>

4
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:41,290
mean you have meters and you have pages

5
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:43,809
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care who sees the meters but we</font>

6
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:46,629
really care about is who can turn the

7
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:50,229
dials on the gauges right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if if</font>

8
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:52,390
an attacker can bring pressure up or if

9
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:57,129
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> open a vowel well then they can</font>

10
00:00:52,390 --> 00:01:01,480
do really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad things so number one thing</font>

11
00:00:57,129 --> 00:01:04,000
we do in operational technology is

12
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,190
protective process not the information

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,800
right and so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're concerned about</font>

14
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:11,020
industrial control systems it's all

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">about control on that process right and</font>

16
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:16,390
so there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good points that</font>

17
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:17,950
Carlos had made about segregation right

18
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,140
and I would even take that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little step</font>

19
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:22,659
farther there are special devices that

20
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,670
you can get there literally one way

21
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:26,409
devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is how do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attack a system</font>

22
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:29,110
how do you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the system would you</font>

23
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:31,630
get into that zone that is owed on the

24
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:35,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">network right so if you only allow data</font>

25
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:37,000
to come out for monitoring then you know

26
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,850
much better position right so if you

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't allow data to go in but an</font>

28
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,360
attacker can connect and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

29
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:47,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things that are really difficult to</font>

30
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,930
control like you know controlling

31
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">accidents like machines have to be</font>

32
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:55,539
available 24 by 7 by 365 do you think

33
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,270
they got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> screen saver</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> timeout no ray</font>

34
00:01:55,539 --> 00:02:00,729
and so physical control will become an

35
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,649
inherited control right you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

36
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:05,590
control things through other means but

37
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:07,149
it takes the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top things like updates and</font>

38
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,890
patches and things like that which<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

39
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:10,989
still important their secondary control

40
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:12,488
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of lose them so you</font>

41
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:13,020
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do them as frequently</font>

42
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:14,610
right

43
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,460
and a control system don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

44
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,170
necessarily be updating software all the

45
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:22,920
time because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can break when we went</font>

46
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:26,399
from Windows XP service pack 1<font color="#CCCCCC"> desert is</font>

47
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:29,010
tacked to decom went away well remember

48
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,230
OPC is based on decomp so a lot of

49
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,570
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can from the first grow ok</font>

50
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:36,720
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really important when you're</font>

51
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:38,700
doing updates they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be tested</font>

52
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,609
they have to be validated<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the</font>

53
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,380
manufacturer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so you can't do those</font>

54
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:45,330
on our plotters regular basis you have

55
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,240
to do them on<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a periodic basis</font>

56
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,700
right and so having primary controls

57
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:55,530
that separate those networks is really

58
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:58,619
the key controls ICS systems you know

59
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:05,550
awesome I lost revenue to all that stuff

60
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:07,680
another question I have who do we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

61
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:10,260
manufacturing<font color="#E5E5E5"> worse the manufacturing</font>

62
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:14,100
area get a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> hands after we have</font>

63
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:19,829
anybody in power energy anybody in

64
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:23,070
pharmaceuticals<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay brewing and a car</font>

65
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:25,620
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going so see if I so again our</font>

66
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:28,890
jobs no you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not how do you do that</font>

67
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of great free tools</font>

68
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:32,760
out there to help you know your network

know your enemy<font color="#CCCCCC"> noms right protection</font>

72
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,390
escaping detection<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> must you have to</font>

73
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,519
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> way there's the same you guys</font>

74
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:46,500
want to be left a boom how do you know

75
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,060
what moon happens how do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know when</font>

76
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,650
you move the right of<font color="#E5E5E5"> boom thank you</font>

77
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,510
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of take a detective controller</font>

78
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,670
place that will help you figure that

79
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,560
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> out right and then applying to</font>

Vincent

81
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:04,880
so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not alone we have fuzzy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> type</font>

82
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:11,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">steering lines us-cert is anybody here</font>

83
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:14,090
us-cert or<font color="#CCCCCC"> ICS sir okay so us-cert was</font>

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,310
created<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think in two thousand they</font>

model themselves after served at org

86
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:23,960
which is Carnegie Mellon push came about

87
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:26,120
after the Boris worm is released and ice

88
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,969
yes sir is really focused on industrial

89
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,250
control systems so it's a whole branch

90
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:33,169
underneath us sir that is wholly

91
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,840
dedicated to industrial control systems

92
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:37,460
they are a global organization we just

93
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,500
have the industrial control systems<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

94
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,150
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group last week people from all</font>

95
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,830
over the world came together people that

96
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,840
are concerned about controlling these

97
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:46,880
systems and keeping them<font color="#E5E5E5"> safe get</font>

98
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,250
together to exchange ideas as a great

forum but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot of places</font>

things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think sharing</font>

108

make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that you know</font>

cybersecurity framework that's a great

114
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,270
way that we can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sternum think</font>

115
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:35,630
about industrial control systems you

116
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:38,120
know again I<font color="#CCCCCC"> T is very different from OT</font>

117
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:40,009
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> when they built the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> national</font>

118
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,900
cybersecurity framework they had

119
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:44,780
industrial control systems in mind

120
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,400
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of other IT frameworks but</font>

121
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,979
they really don't focus on industrial

122
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,870
control systems and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one of</font>

123
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:52,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things i do like about the</font>

124
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:54,289
cybersecurity framework they break

127
00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:01,430
important just got again know what's on

128
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:03,080
your network protect is the most

129
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:07,970
important you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> protect what's on</font>

your network defender of<font color="#CCCCCC"> descent respond</font>

131
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:13,759
recovered their lesser important life

132
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:16,039
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's you can't restore arm</font>

133
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,470
from backups right you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> enlighten</font>

134
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:21,080
equipment you can't restore from its

135
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,970
tape and so we have to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

136
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">things and process controls very</font>

137
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,449
differently than you'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:34,060
can just recover assistance for the

00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:34,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">practices so</font>

141
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:43,330
this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> slight oh yeah so the</font>

142
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:46,330
cybersecurity framework from this is a

143
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:48,909
way to standardize the way we express

144
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:50,919
where we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> what what is our state</font>

00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:52,720
what's our current state what's our

148
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,870
this thing called tears within the

149
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:01,420
cybersecurity framework which is sort of

150
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:04,390
a maturity model so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

151
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,620
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a very simple maturity model</font>

152
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,060
and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are the basic</font>

153
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:10,390
controls that you want to adopt a

154
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:12,190
protective system and then as time goes

155
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:14,770
on you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just implement more and more of a</font>

156
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:18,580
statement it's a good way to sort of

157
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:20,049
frame information<font color="#CCCCCC"> security and I would</font>

158
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,460

00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,570
not familiar with this national

00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:46,150
what can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you identify asset management</font>

169
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,100
know what's on your network know what

equipment what brands will model with

171
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:53,290
firmly identify and categorize your

172
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,359
risks secure your network in our

173
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:56,530
connections the only way that you can do

174
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,730
that is to understand where your

175
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:05,770
operational boundaries are right so the

176
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:07,870
industrial control<font color="#CCCCCC"> sir the ICS turd they</font>

177
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:10,840
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> go on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> inside hundreds of times</font>

178
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:13,300
a year to companies that are compromised

179
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,909
and they'll do really deep studies about

180
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:18,700
what happened and like ninety-nine

181
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:20,950
percent of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:23,890
trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> poundridge has been broken so</font>

183
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:26,620
knowing what zones<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have and</font>

184
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:30,990
selecting very carefully what goes into

185
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,990
different size is incredibly important

186
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:39,430
training there's a lot of really good

187
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:42,550
training is available from ics-cert so

188
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:45,279
they have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the list of course of</font>

189
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:46,930
your cake and I venture all these in the

190
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,570
last year they're pretty quick<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

191
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:52,870
online but if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know more</font>

192
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:54,910
about how to how about think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about these</font>

193
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:58,480
systems what kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of attacks are</font>

194
00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:00,520
happening in these systems then this is

195
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:05,440
a great manages to get in free training

196
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:09,040
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost you a penny geeks takes another</font>

197
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:12,399
one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found and you know they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> offer</font>

198
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,250
things on network assurance forensic

199
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,959
basics you know if you do have some sort

200
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,850
of a compromise on a network that's

201
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,170
where is to create example right of

202
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,480
every sort of and prancing whether it's

203
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:26,529
de rabbit<font color="#E5E5E5"> just last year well it turns</font>

204
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">out most trance will not most but a lot</font>

205
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:31,180
of ransomware installations are really

206
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:32,620
following a breach so when somebody

207
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,779
compromises the server and they're

208
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,850
extracting data on the server what

209
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:39,490
they'll do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is don't install ransomware</font>

210
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:42,279
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do you restore it from take</font>

211
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:44,380
you literally go away all your forensic

212
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:46,390
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and so if you're</font>

213
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:52,000
burning down all the evidence of what

214
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:55,120
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> really a crime so learning how to do</font>

215
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,339
response without losing the evidence in

216
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,569
what was<font color="#CCCCCC"> really a crime is kind of a</font>

217
00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:03,680
important thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has been as well</font>

218
00:09:59,569 --> 00:10:07,969
FEMA eNOS got a great response training

219
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,529
there's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more of the Emergency</font>

220
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">Response standards that we're using</font>

221
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:18,499
today in industrial control system

222
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:24,199
security so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> free go register online</font>

223
00:10:18,499 --> 00:10:27,319
to every count another type training so

224
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:28,550
there's a great way paper out there the

225
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:30,019
recommended practice for proving

226
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:33,529
industrial control<font color="#CCCCCC"> system cybersecurity</font>

227
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:36,860
with defense and depth strategies Carlos

228
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:39,019
touched on defensive<font color="#CCCCCC"> depth its report so</font>

229
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:43,459
I would definitely definitely recommend

230
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:46,309
that and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> nest has a standard SP 882</font>

231
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:48,680
which is very specific to<font color="#E5E5E5"> securing</font>

232
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:50,269
industrial control systems and what

233
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,699
they've done is they've taken the nest

234
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:54,410
853 standards which are sort of an

235
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:57,498
overlay standard to apply to every

236
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:59,240
environment and they have provided

237
00:10:57,499 --> 00:11:02,420
additional an additional layer of

238
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:04,730
controls specifically for control

239
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:06,740
systems so itch to think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in</font>

240
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,809
a control system environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might</font>

241
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,309
not have<font color="#E5E5E5"> considered and so I always</font>

242
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:13,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend that to people as a resource</font>

243
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:14,689
as well so if you don't know somewhere

244
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:16,579
you going to go nowhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you don't</font>

245
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:20,929
start somewhere you can go nowhere if

246
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:24,920
you don't have some type of a security

247
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:29,300
plan or program within your company and

248
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:30,949
again this isn't limited to operational

249
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,719
security us both right here security too

250
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:34,339
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of small places that</font>

251
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,709
really don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a program</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

252
00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:39,470
security and so if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in</font>

253
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:41,268
it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Carlos does go mad and</font>

254
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,519
take them you'll start to build a plan

255
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:45,199
start to build an elevator pitch you

256
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:49,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">know just simple things that you can say</font>

257
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:52,309
over and over to get people thinking

258
00:11:49,429 --> 00:11:58,009
about security right<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start that</font>

259
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:59,089
conversation right so that's sort of

260
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:01,699
what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> did was</font>

261
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:04,309
you know I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build into</font>

262
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:06,709
presentations just statistics from the

263
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:08,449
news and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> before you know it</font>

264
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:09,920
management sort of started to take

265
00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:13,430
notice to me and asked a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

266
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:16,729
questions another<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason that</font>

267
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:20,120
specifically within our company why we

268
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:23,480
got interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> cybersecurity will do</font>

269
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:26,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the event the German school where</font>

270
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,999
they lost control their furnace so

271
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:31,040
somebody got control to gauge right

272
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:33,769
starting to turn the knobs and then they

273
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:37,519
disabled<font color="#CCCCCC"> the abilities turned it out</font>

274
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:39,800

<font color="#CCCCCC">huggable that way is quite unexpected</font>

297
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:39,470
the people who do this kind of attack I

298
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:41,969
usually in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> paper</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say for mafia or</font>

00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:44,819
the company so

300
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:46,589
to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway so the issue make it</font>

301
00:13:44,819 --> 00:13:49,229
public the more they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will know that</font>

302
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:51,449
there are failures and issues and<font color="#CCCCCC"> fives</font>

00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:56,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">and software the only will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a willing</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend more money on fixing them so am</font>

305
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:05,490
I the president of our division lost his

306
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:09,060
mind and he was like could this<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font>

307
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:13,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us what yeah of course it could</font>

308
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:15,508
happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to us great so you know</font>

309
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,670
everything you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do and spiders are</font>

310
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:19,860
curious about you know sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

311
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:22,589
understanding what your vulnerabilities

312
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:25,199
are understanding what threats there are

313
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:26,939
what the impact of those threads are

314
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,120
right so that you can serve it to your

315
00:14:26,939 --> 00:14:31,709
risk analysis and in determining are you

316
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,269
going to mitigate that risk are you

317
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:34,680
going to transfer that risk and get

318
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:37,079
insurance right<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're getting</font>

319
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:40,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">accessories so you have to sort of take</font>

320
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:43,229
this risk-based approach to security in

321
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:48,420
operational technology just like a new

322
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:50,160
1i key so what the lessons learned that

323
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">I have over the last years I've been</font>

324
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,019
working a program really hard for the

325
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:57,329
last year is you have to know who your

326
00:14:55,019 --> 00:15:00,480
stakeholders are right and you have to

327
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:03,059
know specifically what role they play in

328
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,899
the company through the lens of cyber

329
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:09,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">hunter right so for example you have a</font>

330
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:11,430
legal team when your legal<font color="#E5E5E5"> team is the</font>

331
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:14,639
company<font color="#CCCCCC"> or judicial</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> within your company</font>

332
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:17,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">that can create agreements like get</font>

333
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,949
legal clauses into vendor contracts or

334
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,190
into procurement contracts right they

335
00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:23,890
come up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things</font>

336
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:25,930
legally binding right your safety team

337
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:28,090
just like Carlos dedicated is really

338
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:30,609
critical that you get integrated with

339
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:33,250
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> security or safety team and build</font>

340
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:35,230
an all-hazards response<font color="#CCCCCC"> plan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right so</font>

341
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:37,810
like those guys have have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a concerns</font>

342
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:40,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">that our way you know a lot of different</font>

343
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:42,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">concerns cyber than one of them and they</font>

344
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,840
have many concerns right so you have to

345
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:46,450
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're framing this thing</font>

346
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,220
working with them as a partner so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

347
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:50,470
you know you get the right level of

348
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,360
activity focused in the right area

349
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:53,680
there's a pretty old saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got to</font>

350
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">know your toothbrushes from your</font>

351
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,760
diamonds right because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

352
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:00,160
you try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to protect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything the same</font>

353
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,590
way then you're going to lose less

354
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,920
toothbrushes and moored items right and

355
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:07,870
so working with the safety team is

356
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,610
critical learning with the ICS<font color="#CCCCCC"> engineers</font>

357
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">ISM critical you know you want to make</font>

358
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:14,650
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you give a little after level</font>

359
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:17,319
of education you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> in industrial</font>

360
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:19,150
control systems there is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this hm I</font>

361
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,190
with a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people in the shop floor</font>

362
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:23,439
using just a few screams<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at pages</font>

363
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:25,330
and can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> change except points or</font>

364
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,280
make any changes but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the engineering</font>

365
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:29,110
guys will they're creating all those

366
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,569
screens and they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually turn the</font>

367
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:33,880
dials and grant access to different

368
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:37,090
views right well they're sharing their

369
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:40,270
passwords to somebody else in the shop

370
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:42,610
does it matter if the protocol can be

371
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:44,710
spooked well not<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have somebody</font>

372
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:46,420
who's like not happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the company</font>

373
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:49,240
right you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be worried about the</font>

374
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:51,219
insider to have to so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

375
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:54,130
simple things like ensuring that people

376
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:56,230
don't share passwords that they have

377
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:58,689
strong passwords they're using a domain

378
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:00,460
controller that's kind of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> firewall</font>

379
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:04,030
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the zone that they're in these things</font>

380
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:05,530
are important so knowing your

381
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:07,599
stakeholders is important for all those

382
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:10,000
reasons but<font color="#E5E5E5"> also if you're going to</font>

383
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,399
build a program you can't do it as one

384
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,959
guy you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a lot of different</font>

385
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">people in the organization</font>

386
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:19,539
and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have to do part of</font>

387
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:21,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">that work you can't sit a 300 question</font>

388
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,990
assessment in front of anybody and

389
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:25,270
expect that they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get that</font>

390
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:27,549
done is in any amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time it's like</font>

391
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:29,320
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happen in a year right but</font>

392
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:31,600
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can take ten questions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and get in</font>

393
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:34,149
front of five people that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

394
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,129
you can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> get done so and when</font>

395
00:17:34,149 --> 00:17:38,049
your stakeholder is important and many

396
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:40,120
cans to make like work again if you

397
00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:42,580
could split up that work and distribute

398
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:45,250
that that work among many different

399
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:52,240
people these things tend to actually get

400
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:54,399
active and forward we're topped out so

401
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,950
in our program what we did was we<font color="#CCCCCC"> met</font>

402
00:17:54,399 --> 00:18:01,120
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> president</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the division and</font>

403
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:04,480
we got his bike and then we asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> him to</font>

404
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,908
provide us access to all of his direct

405
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:10,179
reports and then we invited them into a

406
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:11,919
week and we said we'd like to like to

407
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:13,779
launch this program these are the

408
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,480
components of the program are you on

409
00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:18,309
board<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes they are all on board great</font>

410
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,559
now these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

411
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:22,210
report to and we met with all those

412
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,639
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now we had to go across</font>

413
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:25,690
different locations and we just sort of

414
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,970
work from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the very top of the</font>

415
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:28,929
organization to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom then when you</font>

416
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:31,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">get to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom and the guys are</font>

417
00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:33,279
raising concerns about<font color="#CCCCCC"> whoa hey why are</font>

418
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">we doing this well after their</font>

419
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:38,169
presidents<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we write this or it</font>

420
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:40,360
takes a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the heat off it does help</font>

421
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:41,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">to lubricate system to make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

422
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:50,320
answer

423
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:54,340
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the this is psycho resilience</font>

424
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:59,289
of you if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to us search our ice</font>

425
00:18:54,340 --> 00:19:00,999
yes sir that us survived up if there's

426
00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:02,649
an assessment button on that page and

427
00:19:00,999 --> 00:19:04,659
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can download</font>

428
00:19:02,649 --> 00:19:08,439
is this thing called with cyber

429
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:13,389
resilience review and this was the first

430
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:15,220
step<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a cess Minh tilt and this isn't</font>

431
00:19:13,389 --> 00:19:18,939
specifically designed for industrial

432
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:21,940

was to take those well so we went

right I mean it's little risk but if you

and we have the smallest set of

next year<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to go to the</font>

we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to high shrimp because after</font>

you throw gaining information about

these different zones right so they can

actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> help take your basic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Network</font>

verification and validation let them the

648
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:34,929
way that works similar assessment you go

649
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:37,000
through use a packet capture tool like

650
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:38,920
Wireshark and just capture packets

651
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">flowing through a choke point on your</font>

652
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:45,910
network and then if you do that by

653
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,780
yourself you can go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can sort</font>

654
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:48,670
of just look at the high level

655
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:50,320
statistics you can see what mac

656
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:53,050
addresses around my network what IP

657
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,909
addresses around my network what

658
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:58,720
protocols are on my network do I have my

659

bus on my network stuff like that but

660
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,320
what they'll do is they'll actually run

661
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,760
this through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security onions</font>

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,660
trips that they've set up then

what models do you have what known

667
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:16,540
vulnerabilities are in your network do

668
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:17,949
you have black energy<font color="#E5E5E5"> running on your</font>

670
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:22,870
clean network to start from and once you

671
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:27,699
have that solid base line then you can

672
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:28,929
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build on top of that then they</font>

678
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:41,620
and stuff I'll actually bring a 3d

679
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:45,280
scanner out to your organization they

680
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:47,590
scan the areas<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they put that on top</font>

681
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:51,639
of the architectural bronze you have for

your buildings<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stuff so you can know</font>

683
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,630
and i'll leave several copies of this

684
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:58,840
with you that you can share with your

00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:16,810
not a possibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this gives them an</font>

693
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:19,780
idea of what you're walking into if you

694
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:23,110
have a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> large industrial area so</font>

695
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:26,980
this is a great option well open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source</font>

couple you in the back so there are

signatures that you can get for<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

tool muscles got the dump it<font color="#CCCCCC"> facilities</font>

703
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:47,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">are doing memory captures so again if</font>

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a service is compromised you</font>

00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:52,090
know is and you have like ransomware on

00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,310
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will very likely the key that you</font>

need decrypt that<font color="#E5E5E5"> data is in memory</font>

708
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:59,290
right so one of the best things<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

709
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:02,620
do is do a memory capture right get a

00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:03,820
forensic image of the hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> drives so you</font>

can share<font color="#CCCCCC"> that with people that might</font>

712
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:09,070
have access to tools they could

potentially get your data back grass

714
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:14,439
borrowing is a great tool that you can

715
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:15,530
it's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like Wireshark was its</font>

resistance on your network that will

718
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:22,220
actually do the diagram for you and then

719
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,680
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the grass marble file and</font>

720
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:26,090
actually import that into<font color="#E5E5E5"> cset and boom</font>

721

all the time and they'll expose to keep

734
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:03,800
going search for ICS on chauvin that I

735
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:04,970
oh and I'll show you like all sorts of

736

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:37,129
there any like virtual labs that you can

746
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:38,750
set up there are make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure you get your</font>

747
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:41,810
name on the list and i'll buy you a list

748
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:45,230
there's a guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I just met this last</font>

749
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:45,830
week we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just taken and virtualized an</font>

750
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:49,370
entire

751
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:51,649
system inside of a raspberry pi so all

752
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:53,090
the industrial control protocols all the

753
00:31:51,649 --> 00:31:56,299
networking all the routers all the

754
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:58,939
switches and he has a little connector

755
00:31:56,299 --> 00:32:01,070
that goes in on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the GPIO to a breakout</font>

756
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:04,700
work that's got a whole traffic system

757
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:07,039
right and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wild rank them so</font>

758
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:09,049
you can emulate all this stuff and learn

759
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,640
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the protocols do protocol</font>

760
00:32:09,049 --> 00:32:13,668
sniffing and all that kind of stuff all

761
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that one little $30 computer right</font>

762
00:32:13,669 --> 00:32:18,110
awesome is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you brought the yard</font>

763
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:19,370
stuff yards<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vote</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

764
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:22,908
nowadays you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd like you to know</font>

765
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:25,428
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Sam's sister kufstein 504 and</font>

766
00:32:22,909 --> 00:32:27,139
they talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot about it more and more</font>

767
00:32:25,429 --> 00:32:30,500
and more patients are starting to agree

768
00:32:27,139 --> 00:32:33,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">that stuff into their yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hon stuff I</font>

769
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:35,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">got so another thing I'll say is I'm</font>

770
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:36,559
going to try and get a list of fact

771
00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:39,230
sheets about all the products that I

772
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:41,928
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the continent website</font>

773
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:44,120
and I have a lunch eat page that's just

774
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:46,909
like a brief article about what<font color="#CCCCCC"> tiara</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

775
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:51,320
that came out of like an ICS you know

776
00:32:46,909 --> 00:32:54,350
jwg newsletter right just as nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

777
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:56,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">page yeah so anyway these are the mythos</font>

778
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:58,279
built-in tools i love using to those

779
00:32:56,149 --> 00:33:00,439
built-in tools is a always get to them

780
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:01,639
right never have to worry about like<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

781
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,639
do you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> something into a machine</font>

782
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:06,590
because it's already<font color="#E5E5E5"> there also if you</font>

783
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:09,168
<font color="#CCCCCC">use windows built-in tools you're not</font>

784
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:10,519
increasing your attack surface right so

785
00:33:09,169 --> 00:33:12,799
every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put a tool and machine</font>

786
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:15,230
it's like one more thing you can be used

787
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:17,299
against you so by using the windows<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

788
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:19,730
built-in tools you're not expanding in

789
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:22,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">tac service so these are like standard</font>

790
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:24,260
things item<font color="#E5E5E5"> the task list services give</font>

791
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,360
you a list of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> services that are</font>

792
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,980
running right which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really important</font>

793
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:30,590
because if you going to do next

794
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:32,540
anyway you're going to get a list of the

795
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:34,189
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> like what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the olden</font>

796
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:36,950
communications that you have on what

797
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:39,380
port and then it's going to tell you the

798
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:41,390
process<font color="#CCCCCC"> I need that's connected with you</font>

799
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:44,419
can go back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the task</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lift services</font>

800
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:46,220
list and associate this protocol with

801
00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:48,860
this application and I know those two

802
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:50,720
are connected right and then the ones

803
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,100
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other the other things dramas list i</font>

804
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,179
tend to use to all of our basic

805
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:56,330
investigations<font color="#E5E5E5"> or forensic</font>

806
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:59,390
investigations just to get sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an</font>

807
00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:02,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">overall sense of the state of a mission</font>

808
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:07,429
right so those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really really</font>

809
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:10,000
good ones just<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes to whatever i should</font>

810
00:34:07,429 --> 00:34:10,000
say they're pretty good

811
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:21,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">cousins at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all joking apart I'm just</font>

812
00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:24,429
attacking this one like that said right

813
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:26,619
um you touching a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> topic or I'm</font>

814
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:29,020
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> an issue that is very good at this</font>

815
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:32,500
done and in all this stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> without</font>

816
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:34,090
the echo involvement of search and they

817
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:37,330
got from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the government that's great</font>

818
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:39,399
thing to do I mean at least in and when

819
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:41,409
soon with some companies that use

820
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:44,500
hotspot hazardous materials like a huge

821
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:45,970
chlorine or so like I um they can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

822
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,739
there into assessment for you and they

823
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:50,888
got ton of resources now I know that

824
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:52,330
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it might be something that such</font>

825
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:54,070
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling that once you involve the</font>

826
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:56,830
government we<font color="#E5E5E5"> operate a lot of people's</font>

827
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:58,840
for raising<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands but um they got a lot</font>

828
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:00,850
of resources to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> y'all on on</font>

829
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:03,400
handling<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff especially if those</font>

830
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:05,560
materials are linked<font color="#E5E5E5"> closely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kata system</font>

831
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,420
oh those guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> and oh how a lot about</font>

832
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">that make I've got into resources so</font>

833
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:11,800
that's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the first things that we</font>

834
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,690
tell you look into it<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter try</font>

835
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,970
anything to that's really hard to bring

836
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:17,590
up if you do decide where you want to

837
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:20,470
reach out to stir and work with<font color="#CCCCCC"> stirred</font>

838
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:23,590
there's work you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody in DHS</font>

839
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:25,810
there are very specific protections that

840
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:28,180
they extend to you right that will

841
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:32,200
ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that your information is never</font>

842
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:34,990
shared with a regulator that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not it's</font>

843
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:37,210
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> available for freedom of information</font>

844
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:39,189
act request right so there are very

845
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:41,470
specific things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they do to protect</font>

846
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:43,150
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> information and you can tag</font>

847
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:46,149
anything that you share with them you

848
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:50,670
can tag<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the TLP protocol you know</font>

849
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:53,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of like this can be shared amber</font>

850
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:58,920
don't share with anybody so they're

851
00:35:53,970 --> 00:36:01,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">really good about that you know what</font>

852
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:04,650
they get back to sort of this whole

853
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:07,350
process thing you know the intent is to

854
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:09,360
protect the process we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

855
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:10,920
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about all the different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ways but</font>

856
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:13,830
we're architecting<font color="#E5E5E5"> a system this is</font>

857
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:16,530
misused or abused<font color="#E5E5E5"> I heard a really good</font>

858
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:19,350
one this last week whether trainings a

859
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:21,780
lot of trains use infrared signaling to

control tracks right so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kid</font>

861
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,740
you know he's a smart kid he takes his

862
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,270
programmable remote control right stands

863
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:30,180
over by the switching pushing programs

864
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:32,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">and he captures the information to</font>

865
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:35,940
switch the tracks so now he had the

00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:38,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">ability those remote control click click</font>

867
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:41,280
and he can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually stand trains on her</font>

868
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:44,730
own tracks and he was actually had the

869
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,230
unfortunate experience of being won the

870
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:48,600
very first people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> positive</font>

871
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:51,030
under the newer stronger laws on

872
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:53,220
protecting control systems

873
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:56,310
but you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about the things you</font>

874
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:59,850
know there's another control is used in

875
00:36:56,310 --> 00:37:02,100
train systems that will allow train to

876
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:04,110
pass a red light right it's a very

877
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:06,210
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> control with ultimate in control</font>

878
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:08,400
systems but guess why you reverse two

879
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:10,260
wires and now that red light becomes a

880
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:14,310
great life and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just circumvented</font>

881
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:17,550
that control right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> all things are</font>

882
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:19,950
insecure all control systems are

883
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:24,000
information systems and all information

884
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:26,850
can be an attack a one or a zero just

885
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,980
that value can be an attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> race you</font>

886
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:31,560
have to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of think about these things</font>

887
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:35,850
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> new ways that you wouldn't consider</font>

888
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:38,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">good all right well thank you very much</font>

00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:38,360
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> your time</font>
