as a cohesive unit you're giving service

101
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,550
with the same collateral with the same

102
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:11,079
goals you ever known as we buy stuff for

103
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,850
someone like an IBM or someone like that

offerings look the same building that

108
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:26,800
collab do the same internally the best

109
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:28,270
you can using office driving sing all

110
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,590
day my polyps I've never really run into

111
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:34,690
this before so I'm not even<font color="#CCCCCC"> bother</font>

112
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:36,849
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure this one out two books</font>

113
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,670
you can still see those<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't last</font>

00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:42,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of based on ITIL kind of idealistic</font>

115
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:44,680
this little story about that house with

116
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">all books you don't want to necessarily</font>

117
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,330
do everything in the book that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it says</font>

118
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,590
I'm just saying in general people should

119
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:55,030
read those books it would help them get

120
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:58,030
their act together a lot CMM right you

121
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:59,799
have your five main parts initials are

payable to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> managed to optimizing</font>

123
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:05,080
you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> up any I'll just apologize</font>

124
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,460
again for this I'm not taking time to

125
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,310
troubleshoot this see<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it works now</font>

126
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:10,719
and just keep clicking buttons it's

going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get fit right think it was</font>

this one hold on to go through quicker

137

installing a product honestly I can get

311
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,560
people are winging it not read the

312
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:44,089
manual figured stuff out pride anything

313
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,709
through the dr the situation they got a

314
00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:47,660
tool in place the tool dies they can't

315
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:50,060
recover it that's a classic symptom

317
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:54,199

687
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:33,499
Microsoft I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would turn the power off</font>

with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that let's keep pushing buttons</font>

689
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:38,570

everything in technology right you can't

696
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:54,889
play favorites in security that's the

697
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:56,449
point there people are going to pull in

698
00:25:54,889 --> 00:25:57,889
new stuff sometimes they're going to go

699
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:59,720
on go into areas that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>
