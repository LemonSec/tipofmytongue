1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
really seriously and everyone go home

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,160
and

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,080
what cova 19 has really shown us is that

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,200
we have to be able to adjust and adapt

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,200
rather quickly

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,320
most companies during this transition

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,840
were working on

8
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,440
premises with a lot of their data

9
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,160
centers they had people that were coming

10
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,800
in via

11
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,960
always on vpn if they were at home they

12
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,720
had to use a citrix environment or they

13
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,039
had to be

14
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,720
tied or tethered and when you go home

15
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,400
and you work in a home environment

16
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,080
you need a little bit more flexibility

17
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,320
when you do that the problem with

18
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,480
everyone going home all at once is that

19
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,920
you had diminished network and vpn

20
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,800
capacity

21
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,320
the user experience could often times be

22
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,718
hit or miss

23
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,440
the big thing though that a lot of

24
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:49,039
companies dealt with was the reduced

25
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,839
audio and video quality as well and

26
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,840
we had as you noticed from the the chart

27
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,280
we went from

28
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,760
middle of last year 2019 with 13 million

29
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,359
users in teams and i know there's a lot

30
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,199
of other collaboration suites out there

31
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,680
that's the one that we use

32
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,039
the big jump though is if you look just

33
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,080
in the short time frame

34
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,240
from march to april we went from 32 to

35
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,000
75 million

36
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,520
and that's not any small number by any

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,040
means because there's a lot of things

38
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,320
that have to happen there

39
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,360
and how did we do this with limited

40
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,919
impact

41
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,400
to the back end systems how do we do

42
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,880
this by trusting the user the devices

43
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,360
the apps that have to access as well

44
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,079
and with the growth of what's going on

45
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,799
now we had

46
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,079
at one point 4.1 billion daily meeting

47
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,880
minutes that were happening in our

48
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,639
environment

49
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,320
now these are numbers as of may june

50
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,280
time frame we're now

51
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,919
in october the numbers continue to grow

52
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,280
and

53
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,360
we're going to talk about what that

54
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,000
really means to trust

55
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,680
and verify continuously so you don't

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,520
have to have an analyst trying to figure

57
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,280
out how to help the user get in or you

58
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,600
don't have to have an end user

59
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,719
who is trying to verify via five or six

60
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,880
different things

61
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,479
let's see how we can build an

62
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,240
environment that is effective and

63
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,679
efficient and allows for the operations

64
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,239
to continue to go

65
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,200
regardless if users are in the in the

66
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,760
environment at work

67
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,560
or they're at home sean certain yes are

68
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,200
you presenting

69
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,200
a slideshow

70
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,280
i was uh we don't actually see that

71
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,319
um sorry i first thought you were doing

72
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,760
your intro and then i realized you were

73
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,958
talking about data

74
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,200
are you sure that you will share your

75
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,959
screen and uh share out yeah

76
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,720
yep i'm yep

77
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,480
no worries i'm sorry about that sean

78
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:40,480
like i said this isn't normally

79
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:44,238
i thought let's try that again

80
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:48,879
is it up nope

81
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,879
um okay share screen

82
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,319
here you go it's starting now perfect

83
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,319
there you go sean

84
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,920
see technical issues already so you

85
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,040
didn't miss much this is slide one we're

86
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,238
good

87
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,159
all the back end stuffs which you want

88
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:10,319
to talk to anyway

89
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,319
as we as we continue to talk about this

90
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:21,040
just a second

91
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,040
and did it again

92
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:33,840
we still see it you just switch slides

93
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:33,840
there we go excellent thank you for that

94
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:50,640
my slide's still up it is

95
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,200
thank you so

96
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,760
a lot of customers so my job is to talk

97
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,200
to

98
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,920
csos executives senior security officers

99
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,760
that are working through their ongoing

100
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,119
business requirements their operational

101
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,599
issues that they're dealing with

102
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,280
not to mention the ongoing threats of

103
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,079
adversaries vulnerabilities in the

104
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,760
environment

105
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,239
how do we keep going and doing our

106
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,399
day-to-day i have a lot of

107
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,599
fortune 500 companies that i talked to

108
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,160
in my position

109
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,199
and they're struggling because they made

110
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,320
a decision at some point to have

111
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,400
and design a production environment that

112
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,000
is going to have firewalls intrusion

113
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,280
prevention it's going to filter all

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,360
their traffic

115
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,960
they have what's called an always-on vpn

116
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,560
virtual private network

117
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,840
and that causes a really

118
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,560
the environment just to really get

119
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,359
bogged down because we have data coming

120
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,880
through

121
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,400
you have people that are at home they're

122
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,759
trying to get stuff done

123
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,198
their company's telling them they've got

124
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:52,479
to be on the ozone the always on vpn

125
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:55,040
and we needed to shift that mindset

126
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,159
so that they we use split tunneling here

127
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,759
at microsoft and

128
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,080
and we encourage other companies to do

129
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,440
that and look at ways to architect that

130
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,039
kind of solution out

131
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,199
our own cso has chartered that microsoft

132
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,000
is looking to one day get rid of the vpn

133
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,320
altogether

134
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,639
so that we're working in the edge uh the

135
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,840
challenges with port 80 is what it

136
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,560
really is a firewall bypass port so

137
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,960
you have to use the vpn but what happens

138
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,600
is

139
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,880
attackers leverage that to retain access

140
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,240
into the corpnet

141
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,159
one of the things that we say is why

142
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,680
should i spend all my time trying to

143
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,080
break into your environment if i can

144
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,840
just

145
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,359
snag someone's credentials and go in

146
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,479
through the front door

147
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:38,240
and we've designed and and we

148
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:40,800
take this zero trust approach because

149
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,240
when you move off-prem and into the

150
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,600
cloud you have to think differently

151
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,000
about networking

152
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,680
you can't put a server in a room and say

153
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,280
okay nobody's going to access it no

154
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,440
one's going to access the data

155
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,520
i have to focus on data protection and

156
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,080
security of the applications

157
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,840
regardless of where so when we talk

158
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,280
about networking in the cloud

159
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,119
it's a little bit different because we

160
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,799
have to have renewed focus on trust

161
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,800
as well when you think about

162
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,039
our connectivity principles that we have

163
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,400
is we needed to figure out how to

164
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,599
optimize our 365 traffic uh enable that

165
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,638
local egress

166
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,720
and when we talk microsoft 365

167
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,479
in terminology is you're talking about

168
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,400
our office suite of tools

169
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,719
you're talking about windows 10 in our

170
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,880
case and our mobility suite

171
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,080
and everyone at microsoft works within

172
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,240
that microsoft 365 environment

173
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,120
we needed to also figure out how to

174
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,400
enable

175
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,280
direct connectivity and i identify those

176
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,280
paths that are going to

177
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,960
optimize for microsoft 365. so for today

178
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,479
and in the short time i have with you

179
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,799
i'm really going to focus on how do i

180
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,199
modernize security for sas

181
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,000
those software as a service things how

182
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,400
do i

183
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,360
assess how i'm going to have to bypass a

184
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,280
proxy

185
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,960
or taking a different approach to those

186
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,080
security controls so that i avoid

187
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,638
duplication

188
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,400
i i i it's going to bottleneck the

189
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,720
traffic can add latency

190
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,440
uh i want to be able to do that without

191
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,440
adding that

192
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,960
adding that additional security right i

193
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,440
want to be able to allow people to get

194
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,440
access

195
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,039
easier and be able to verify and

196
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,000
validate who they are and what they're

197
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,520
coming in on

198
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,080
so they don't have to go through a help

199
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,599
desk or try and get on-prem or find an

200
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,599
office location to sit in

201
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:28,960
when we talk about yzero trust

202
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,639
we treat every access attempt as if it

203
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,440
were originating from an untrusted

204
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,319
source

205
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,960
so we know that i t security is complex

206
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,960
you have

207
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,080
a lot of devices a lot of users a lot of

208
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,159
connections

209
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,758
uh i used to and i still encourage

210
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,240
companies to use what's called the cis

211
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,000
benchmark or the sans top 20

212
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,479
and i knew when i went into an

213
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,639
organization my success or

214
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,840
failure ratio would depending on where i

215
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,000
was starting from

216
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,359
when i asked the cio or the it

217
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,599
infrastructure team

218
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,680
can you give me an inventory of assets

219
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,759
inventory of applications and give me

220
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,840
the latest patch report

221
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,440
and normally they they look at you with

222
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,799
a third eye or they tell you it's going

223
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,199
to take a couple of weeks

224
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,560
we really don't have a good we have it

225
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,599
but we have to get it all pulled

226
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,039
together

227
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,719
that kind of approach isn't going to

228
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,120
really work and

229
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,960
we need to be able to know what devices

230
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,120
applications

231
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,719
entities people are trying to access at

232
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,080
any given time

233
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,240
so the initial attacks they were

234
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,240
they were network-based they were simple

235
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,080
economics

236
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,320
you accepted lower security once you

237
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,159
were in the network if i was on site at

238
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,120
the facility and i was working inside

239
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,200
the building

240
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,479
there was less concern over my ability

241
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,839
to do something

242
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,519
nefarious so to speak so now

243
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,000
attackers are shifting to identity

244
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,440
attacks number one way

245
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,440
that we're seeing through our incident

246
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,120
response team here at microsoft that

247
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,480
the adversaries are getting in is

248
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,720
through phishing attacks

249
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,839
uh it no matter how well you conduct

250
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,720
training

251
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,519
the end user is going to what click the

252
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,880
link

253
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:07,120
and they get into the system

254
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,880
they're able to ransomware attacks are

255
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,399
are prevalent we have companies that are

256
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,920
struggling trying to figure out do i pay

257
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,880
the million dollars

258
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,000
how could i have prevented this and when

259
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,839
you look at

260
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,480
the ongoing uh the evolution of these

261
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,600
things

262
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,720
and you look at the attack surfaces

263
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,320
it's cheap i can buy an exploit kit uh

264
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,920
we have we've done a lot of research

265
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,880
into this and we've we've done a lot of

266
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,560
analysis across

267
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,240
industry talking to other companies that

268
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,239
deal with this and

269
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,760
if you look at just a zero day or you

270
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,920
look at ransomware

271
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,200
uh i'm going to basically pay a small

272
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,040
fee for a tool

273
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,880
that's going to go exploit and then i

274
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,040
pay a small fee for the

275
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,720
for the luxury of being able to use that

276
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,079
the interesting thing with the dark web

277
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,480
and where all this stuff is going

278
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,839
is it comes with full support if i can't

279
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,680
get it to work or i'm not really

280
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,519
knowledgeable on how to how to code

281
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,439
i can literally send an email or text

282
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,120
message somewhere and they'll help me

283
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,640
and that's that's great i can get help

284
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,040
to help exploit

285
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,360
this company and take advantage of it

286
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,719
and we have forced really industry

287
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,720
to look at zero trust and what is my

288
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,839
strategy going to be about that

289
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,200
i have to have continuous validation and

290
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,640
we have to build those security

291
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,240
assurances in

292
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,760
for both the business data and the

293
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,680
applications

294
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,040
there used to be a time where you'd go

295
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,239
to the executives and say

296
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,920
what data is important and without

297
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,120
wanting to take the time to really look

298
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,959
at where they were look at what they're

299
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,200
doing they'd say it's all important

300
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,560
and the it and security team would say

301
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,880
well then i need more money

302
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,359
because i can't possibly protect

303
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,360
everything to the level that you say

304
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,720
and now we need to be able to distribute

305
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,519
that we need to be able to have

306
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,680
policy driven access we need to be able

307
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,079
to have information protection

308
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,680
that's able to identify what level

309
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,760
something needs to be based on where

310
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,719
it's generated who created it based on

311
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,800
policy

312
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,920
and then track the life of that document

313
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,719
or that entity

314
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,319
from end to end so if someone comes on

315
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,800
they verify who they are

316
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,920
they verify that they're authorized to

317
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,640
to have access

318
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,000
then they're granted access we also have

319
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,199
to be able to

320
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,240
look at the modern sock if i traditional

321
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,360
socks

322
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,720
security operations do tier one tier two

323
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,800
they're constantly dealing with end

324
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,640
users who need to reset passwords or get

325
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,279
access to a file

326
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,959
we want to look at how do we do deep

327
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,959
visibility in the telemetry

328
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,399
not just in the firewall but end to end

329
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,518
across our environment

330
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,399
how do i do rapid remediation one of the

331
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,880
things that we

332
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,000
encourage organizations to investigate

333
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,959
and research and see

334
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,279
whether there's something that would

335
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,518
help them is the soar capability

336
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,480
security orchestration remediation

337
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,880
let the system identify and say okay i

338
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,959
have

339
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,320
bill who's trying to come in from

340
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,000
redmond washington

341
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,519
washington and france paris france

342
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,680
bill can't do this from three different

343
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,720
locations so the system will take all

344
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,279
the telemetry

345
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,800
assess what's going on and establish a

346
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,120
risk score of that

347
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,160
and then challenge all three of those

348
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,079
accesses

349
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,920
so that the end user then has to add an

350
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,560
additional layer of authentication

351
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,000
to get access two of the three will not

352
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,839
be able to meet the requirements and

353
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,720
their access will be revoked

354
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,480
or blocked this increases security and

355
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,639
increases productivity

356
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,399
we allow users to be able to reset their

357
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,560
passwords to be able to set up their

358
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,079
and enroll their devices without having

359
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,000
to go into the office

360
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,920
and this is all done through this zero

361
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,160
trust environment

362
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,240
and then you also of course have your

363
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,160
your data center access and isolation

364
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,880
architecture iot

365
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,160
which is going to have that ot

366
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,560
environment as well

367
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,079
so now i'm working in it and i've been

368
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,518
told not only do you have a hundred

369
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,519
thousand endpoints

370
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,120
we now have put sensors in all the

371
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,519
manufacturing plants

372
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,880
and security i t you're now responsible

373
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:03,040
for an additional 500 000 endpoints

374
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,320
now you're starting to get overwhelmed

375
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,839
because you're now looking at a much

376
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,440
larger

377
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,959
architecture how do i have the same

378
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,000
controls that i built networks on

379
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,239
yesterday

380
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
to meet these modern needs these modern

381
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,639
requirements we do that through

382
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,240
zero trust when we talk about the

383
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,519
benefits of it

384
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,040
you're going to reduce the risk and

385
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,800
you're still going to trust but verify

386
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,079
but that trust is now going to be earned

387
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,920
not given

388
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,599
uh it used to be a day where i'd walk

389
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,240
into a cleared area

390
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,279
and i would have a friend of mine or i'd

391
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,200
be with somebody

392
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,639
and they would say hey this is sean he

393
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,519
works at such and such

394
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,240
agency uh he's he's coming in with me

395
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,160
today

396
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,680
can you get him into the system they'd

397
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,439
give me a tent badge

398
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,199
i'd go with them i'd go and and what now

399
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,839
that wouldn't be the case i would have

400
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,519
to have some form of identification

401
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,199
to be regardless of whether they were

402
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,160
trying to verify and they'd known me for

403
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,040
years

404
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,079
i now have to be able to earn that trust

405
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,000
and i can't just be

406
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,680
given it just because somebody says oh

407
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,199
they're good to go there's got to be a

408
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,040
level of authentication

409
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,040
and validation that's going to be there

410
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,120
and it has to be done continuously

411
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,439
uh we're going to increase uh improve

412
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,519
security visibility as well

413
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,360
there won't be any blind spots a

414
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,199
centralized view of your risks

415
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,720
you're going to have deep insight into

416
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,760
your devices

417
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,600
i have a personal phone and

418
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,560
everyone at microsoft who wants to have

419
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,240
access on their personal mobile device

420
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,000
has to follow the policy of enrolling

421
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,959
that device in what we call intune

422
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
or our device management software and

423
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,279
i've been given

424
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,880
a laptop to access but if i want to have

425
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,120
the privilege or luxury of being able to

426
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,399
check email go to teams go and do some

427
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,120
collaboration

428
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,199
work on a file on my on my mobile i have

429
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,959
to agree that yes i'm going to

430
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,839
enroll that device and that means that i

431
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,239
now have

432
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,279
the ability to feel for the company to

433
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,880
trust my device

434
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,040
that i'm running biometrics that i'm

435
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,040
running security and if i were to try

436
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,639
and remove one of those pieces

437
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,319
the company would say no you don't meet

438
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,079
the trust requirements you're not

439
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,279
getting access to the back end systems

440
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,479
on that device

441
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,279
try again it increases the productivity

442
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,240
as i've said

443
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,399
a few times i have the ability for end

444
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,440
users obviously to work anywhere

445
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:24,320
apps and data is available anywhere and

446
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,160
you have the now architecture can be

447
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,040
built so that even if they're

448
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,639
at home they can go through their cloud

449
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,240
authentication

450
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,120
and build out their capabilities to

451
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,560
access on-prem applications as well

452
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,959
as i mentioned you can now choose your

453
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,239
own device you don't have to issue

454
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,880
devices to everyone

455
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,839
they can pull off of a list and as long

456
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,000
as it's on the list

457
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,279
go and deploy it get it enrolled and

458
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,199
move from there

459
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,759
we encourage customers to push

460
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:54,160
multi-factor authentication

461
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,839
if we have that an improved access

462
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,000
denied experience what we do is we

463
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,920
prompt it to increase the trust

464
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,759
and then we limit access based on

465
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,079
role-based access control

466
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,160
all of our administrators and all of our

467
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,399
users now have to follow what's called

468
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,439
jitengia or just in time just enough

469
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,160
access

470
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,920
so you need access to a to a server

471
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,920
you're going put in a request

472
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,079
you're granted two hours go do what you

473
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,599
need to do your access goes away

474
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,120
that's based on the authentication of

475
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,120
the device and the trust

476
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,560
the authentication of you to the

477
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,240
identity platform

478
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,599
verifying who you are and then you're

479
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,800
granted access

480
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,199
so it's really controlled at every level

481
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,240
and you have much better productivity

482
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,839
because of it

483
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,920
and then of course the goal to go to

484
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,160
passwordless uh

485
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,000
windows 10 has this capability i know

486
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,000
that on my iphone i have the ability to

487
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,680
look at screen unlock computer

488
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,279
we really can't make it any easier than

489
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,000
that for our end users

490
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,800
and passwords are a pain i don't care

491
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,120
how hard you

492
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,800
make it how long you make it somebody

493
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,600
somewhere is going to create a code

494
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,439
create code or some algorithm that's

495
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,839
going to break that password

496
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,519
and it just causes a lot of

497
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,720
consternation across the environment

498
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,760
when you have to remember

499
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,799
200 plus passwords let's try and go with

500
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,760
identity

501
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:13,280
multi-factor authentication of a pen or

502
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,240
even biometrics where you look at the

503
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,480
screen and it unlocks the computer

504
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,919
typical networks uh where did we come

505
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,679
from uh you were

506
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,000
at microsoft at one point you were on

507
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,240
the back end uh you sat on any of the

508
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,599
various environments whether it was in

509
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,240
our research and development

510
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:32,240
manufacturing finance

511
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,080
you were in tech support you came

512
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,320
through the different operating systems

513
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,520
whether it was mac linux

514
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,320
windows and you basically went through

515
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,840
the firewall

516
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,600
got access to the cloud and went and did

517
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,240
what you needed to do uh

518
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,120
there wasn't it there wasn't really any

519
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,880
uh

520
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,799
zero trust there it was just hey you're

521
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,960
in the environment you obviously are

522
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:55,039
trusted go ahead and have access

523
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,799
well that's gone now that that whole

524
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,240
mentality has shifted

525
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,799
now we're looking at network

526
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,679
segmentation or what we call micro

527
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:06,240
segmentation

528
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:09,200
where a user accesses devices

529
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,280
and they come in and they have to verify

530
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,520
identity which removes passwords

531
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,720
we have to verify device health which

532
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,520
means they have to be

533
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,039
patched they have to have security

534
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,760
controls installed

535
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,160
the user has to be authenticated and

536
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,480
then

537
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,280
their access will be verified based on

538
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,840
their trust

539
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,639
and the management level and if you look

540
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,879
at what we've done

541
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,720
here as we shifted this mentality you

542
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,400
can have now segmentation across

543
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,640
business critical apps

544
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,520
high impact of your iot or ot

545
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,760
environments

546
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,440
and then you also have some low impact

547
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,799
and then we still have that managed

548
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,320
corporation

549
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,400
but it allows you to have better

550
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:51,678
segmentation better control

551
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,679
and then you can really focus on sorry

552
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,320
you can really focus on the business of

553
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,639
running

554
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:02,240
the business rather than having to deal

555
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,240
with what do i do next

556
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,240
we also enable that xero trust to be

557
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,959
able to do

558
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,960
new segmentation so if a traditional

559
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,080
network is struggling to keep up

560
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,160
with uh rich and involving applications

561
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,240
and hopefully everyone on the call has

562
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,760
heard of devops or devsecops or some

563
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,559
variation of that

564
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,640
we have rapid development happening at a

565
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,559
lot of our companies uh i was working

566
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,200
with a cecillar retail company not too

567
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,280
long ago

568
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,160
and they put out two or more new

569
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:35,200
applications every single day

570
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,200
and in the past that was a huge

571
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,360
approval process that it had to go to it

572
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,919
could take days weeks or months

573
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,799
now we have to have constant application

574
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,440
innovation

575
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:47,120
we have to have proprietary or or we

576
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,919
have to work with data structures that

577
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,080
might be proprietary with the company

578
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,960
we have an evolution of the protocols

579
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,199
that are being used

580
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,799
used and we also have to make sure that

581
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,120
we have that encryption

582
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,000
of that data going on as well so we

583
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,678
extend

584
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,559
xero trust for sas to those new

585
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,360
environments

586
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,720
so it creates better security and better

587
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,360
user experience

588
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,960
because we're able to verify access and

589
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,678
differentiate those different kinds of

590
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,000
connections

591
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,919
and then also be able to push that out

592
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,320
across the organization

593
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,520
so we have different identities based on

594
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,879
what you're doing

595
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,360
if i'm going to log in as an

596
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,799
administrator i have a strongly managed

597
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,240
identity i might be told

598
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,480
you're going to go off a privileged

599
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,640
device not one that's

600
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,240
your own i have then managed identities

601
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,440
and then of course we have the consumer

602
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,960
identities

603
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,400
and then everything is based on that

604
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,120
policy engine that's sitting in the

605
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,640
middle

606
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,879
how do i meet policy am i in my

607
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,559
and it's constantly maturing so that as

608
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,200
the system gets smarter and starts

609
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,840
learning

610
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,039
roles and learning capabilities uh it'll

611
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,240
identify that ho

612
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:55,919
so sean works out of this office he he's

613
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,159
there 90 percent of the time

614
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,159
if the system senses an anomaly it might

615
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,640
shoot me an additional challenge

616
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,280
but for the most part we've now created

617
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,360
this

618
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,360
segmentation different way of looking at

619
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,240
things data protection security

620
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:13,678
management of the applications

621
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,039
uh native controls uh many in industry

622
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,000
are still operating within a threat

623
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,039
model that was

624
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,559
built gosh decades ago and

625
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,120
they're applying those controls that

626
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:26,559
really don't make sense if you look at

627
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,639
native m365 controls and

628
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,480
if you've been unless you've been hiding

629
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,200
under a rock i've been in microsoft four

630
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,760
years

631
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,039
i had to hit some i believe button as

632
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,679
well when i

633
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:39,600
came on board i wasn't sure whether

634
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,480
microsoft had a good security story what

635
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,719
did we mature

636
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,480
how were we doing it one of the things

637
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,080
that i found is with the

638
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,600
billion dollars a year we're spending on

639
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,639
security r d

640
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,199
and this new approach to xero trust we

641
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,760
now

642
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,120
have been able to lower the curve on the

643
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,120
overhead of your network

644
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,399
and we've been able to bring that down

645
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,120
so that

646
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,240
you have split tunneling in place which

647
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,639
allows you to have

648
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,400
the vpn used for corporate based access

649
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,919
and corporate-based services

650
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,000
people can go and do internet or

651
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,039
internet based things

652
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,120
traffic from the users with through m365

653
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:18,400
is fast lane without additional

654
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,158
wickets it goes into its own tenant

655
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,679
and we have a lot of different security

656
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,360
controls that we've put into place as

657
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:27,200
well

658
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,879
so how do we get there uh well so

659
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,120
part of the challenge that that i t

660
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,840
departments have from what i've seen is

661
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,959
they are coming from different

662
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,520
backgrounds

663
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,440
and when you talk about how they align

664
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,918
you might have a network team that

665
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,039
is focused on the physical network of

666
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,960
the environment

667
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,480
you might have a services team or an

668
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,320
endpoint team that really is

669
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,600
i'm not caring about the network i worry

670
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,360
about the endpoints

671
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,039
and we're going to lock those down and

672
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,520
then you have that application

673
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,600
development group right the real rogues

674
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,639
that they've got a job to do to keep the

675
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,399
business going

676
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,000
so they have their own program all

677
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,480
together well

678
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,360
we need to first align the teams let's

679
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,640
let's get a cloud group or a cloud team

680
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,360
that's going to get in there to talk

681
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,880
about identity across the whole platform

682
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,199
how are we going to talk about it

683
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,320
spanning the network what does identity

684
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,520
mean for our organization and

685
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,360
we want to be able to think zero trust

686
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,200
and how we're going to work together to

687
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,719
understand the business and where the

688
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,200
business wants to go

689
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,960
so we want to build out that modern

690
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,600
perimeter

691
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,400
we have the users who we need to go

692
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,158
passwordless

693
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,679
so let's implement something like hello

694
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,679
or biometrics

695
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,960
we want to do mfa so let's implement

696
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,799
multi-factor

697
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,080
let's make sure that our devices are

698
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,080
running the most recent

699
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,080
operating systems and that we have a

700
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,279
strategy to get off legacy apps or

701
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,559
legacy

702
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:55,200
software let's continue to work that

703
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:58,320
strategy so that we can segment it out

704
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,000
so that applications can modernize apps

705
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,760
they can make sure that they have app

706
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,559
compatibility with the new operating

707
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,960
systems

708
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,799
but they can also work within that app

709
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,760
proxy that we have that will allow you

710
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,320
to go

711
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,080
into the cloud and reach back into your

712
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,840
on-prem environment as well

713
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,360
and that works across data and then

714
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,600
you're able to do

715
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,320
new systems work with your data to

716
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,158
identify and track it and get it

717
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,799
get it put into the right buckets and

718
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,480
then also with your legacy stuff as well

719
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,240
and then we continue to refine that

720
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,320
segmentation

721
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,840
we look at how do i get from one big

722
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,120
clues of a network where everybody has

723
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,600
access to everything

724
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,520
to then micro segmentation and then

725
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,279
being able to build that out to bring in

726
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,799
the legacy apps whether they need to be

727
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:43,520
recoded redeveloped

728
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,520
where do we go from here and this allows

729
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,279
you to have a transformation plan

730
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,559
getting everybody on board coming up

731
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,640
with your requirements and then a

732
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:53,360
roadmap to get you there

733
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,480
some of the challenges we've seen uh

734
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,600
consistent

735
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,600
with uh so i talked to a lot of csos

736
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,959
and the number one thing they're trying

737
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,199
to do is they report to

738
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,080
either cio or cfo or in some cases the

739
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,120
ceo

740
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,039
uh hey hey sue you're the cso can you

741
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,600
help us control costs

742
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:13,200
uh we wanna we we're really really uh

743
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,399
hurting here with the cost that this is

744
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,320
all going to take

745
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,760
and then you have to go back to wait a

746
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,678
second they told me to reduce

747
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:24,720
risk i need to also look at cost savings

748
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,520
i we can do both and a lot of what's

749
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,320
happened in the

750
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,400
in our world is we've tried to embed and

751
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,399
build security into our tools

752
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,760
and if it used to be where you'd buy

753
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,360
windows

754
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,200
and then you as a company would go out

755
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,639
and buy three four five pieces of

756
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,880
software to secure it

757
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,320
we now have microsoft defender we've

758
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,480
installed uh

759
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,480
code into the environment into windows

760
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,120
and onto the devices around credential

761
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,799
guard

762
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,719
application guard device guard

763
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,559
protection mechanisms that are there

764
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,039
and those challenges there's i need to

765
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,720
reduce risk let's look at a company or a

766
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,279
company and their partners that can help

767
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,760
us

768
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,919
to build this environment with the least

769
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,200
risk to the organization

770
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,720
let's figure out how to do lease

771
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,320
privilege access start with your

772
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,080
administrators

773
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,200
how do i do rapid detection and

774
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,600
remediation i need good telemetry i need

775
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,360
to

776
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,840
see what's going on across the

777
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,520
environment when you go to cloud

778
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,439
you should be able to go to the portal

779
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,039
and see what everyone's touching

780
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,640
and and what devices are in your

781
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,960
environment with the click of

782
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,120
with a few clicks of the mouse uh you

783
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,279
look at technology

784
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,600
the waterfall that i mentioned or devops

785
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,440
releases are moving faster and faster

786
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,080
you have to you have to learn to be very

787
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,080
dynamic adapt to the architecture that's

788
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,039
continuously involving

789
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,279
you have to be able to increase

790
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,840
automation we encourage as i stated

791
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,480
before

792
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,959
look into those sore capabilities see if

793
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,279
those are

794
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,520
things that your organization can

795
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,679
support how you're going to do

796
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,279
tier one let the system do that

797
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,679
orchestration and remediation and then

798
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,559
have an

799
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,520
analyst verify or validate what took

800
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,760
place

801
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,279
and then finally you gotta really have

802
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,360
this this is tough for some of us in

803
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,880
security right you have to have empathy

804
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,240
you have to understand that there's a

805
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,760
learning curve that there's training

806
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,679
that has to take place

807
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,000
you have to be able to engage and come

808
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,600
out of your office and talk to people

809
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,440
understand what their true business

810
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,719
requirements are

811
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:21,039
we pushed out windows hello it was

812
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,039
not a requirement initially but because

813
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,799
it was so user friendly

814
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,399
it helped security but it helped the end

815
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,000
user they could access looking at their

816
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:31,439
screen or with a pin number

817
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,440
we had huge success and it was absorbed

818
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,399
into the organization at a much faster

819
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,080
rate

820
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:38,000
than in the past when we just pushed and

821
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,639
said you must do this by such and such a

822
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,200
date

823
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,120
uh so you you don't have to be able to

824
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,360
force it down their throat

825
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,199
make security in intuitive and in the

826
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,360
environment as they use it

827
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,559
and then finally get those diverse

828
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,240
perspectives how are you going to

829
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,918
recruit and retain

830
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,039
and understand what you're trying to do

831
00:27:53,919 --> 00:28:00,000
across your organization

832
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:02,080
we talk about some key takeaways here

833
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,039
when we talk about xero trust

834
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,199
you want to enable users to connect

835
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,440
directly to their cloud resources

836
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,760
i want to be able to allow them to get a

837
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,640
device off the shelf or buy it through

838
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,039
the online service get it at the house

839
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,559
log

840
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:19,039
in authenticate get access to the back

841
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,799
end

842
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,720
somebody in the process above them

843
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,879
approves and their device can be

844
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,039
configured and installed and set up

845
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,880
without ever having to go to a help desk

846
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,879
it allows for better productivity it

847
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,840
allows for them to much have a much

848
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,440
much much better user experience and

849
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,480
then we want to be able to

850
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,880
i look at i look at security this way

851
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,320
i'm going to look at the tools i'm going

852
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,399
to push out the tools

853
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,240
i'm going to implement policy and i'm

854
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,879
going to monitor the ever-level heck out

855
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,120
of it

856
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,640
and we want to be able to do that in the

857
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,799
quickest way possible

858
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,679
so i want to make sure that that you

859
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,279
have that

860
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,960
ability to enforce security through

861
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,399
policy number two

862
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,000
make sure that you're engaging and

863
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,918
training your i.t and security train

864
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,399
uh security teams around zero trust what

865
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:07,200
does it mean uh you might have heard it

866
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,000
called conditional access zero trust is

867
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,720
something that

868
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,760
needs to be thought through needs to be

869
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,159
implemented

870
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,919
along with your identity protection is

871
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,399
your information protection

872
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,120
and zero trust is where you really have

873
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:22,158
the best

874
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,279
level of being able to protect your

875
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,159
organization from

876
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:28,080
from adversaries taking over if they

877
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,440
can't get access to your credentials

878
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,199
chances are they can't get access to

879
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,159
your data and therefore you're going to

880
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,520
be the hero

881
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,360
and you're going to have a lot better

882
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,279
user or a lot better

883
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,879
professional experience in your position

884
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:41,360
as a security engineer or

885
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,159
higher in the organization and then

886
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,760
follow our

887
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,200
our modernization plan that we've given

888
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,840
you

889
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,399
how does this look for us i promise this

890
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,918
isn't a

891
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,760
sales pitch by any means but i do want

892
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,799
to show you some things that we've

893
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,240
learned from

894
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,000
so i'm giving you some additional

895
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,080
resources some recommended

896
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
actions that microsoft and our in our

897
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,799
industry has worked very hard to bring

898
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,840
together

899
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,039
uh to help you the end users understand

900
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,720
where you need to go and what you're

901
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:10,799
looking to do

902
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:13,279
uh i'm we have a phases of zero trust

903
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,879
so pre-zero trust you might be in this

904
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,080
environment now where you don't have any

905
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,399
device management

906
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,840
you're using single factor uh you have

907
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,799
the capability to enforce

908
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,918
uh strong identity doesn't even exist

909
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,399
all the way to

910
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,440
uh you start verifying identities then

911
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,520
devices

912
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,559
then their access and then finally their

913
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,120
services

914
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,840
and it goes back to that maturity model

915
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,158
that some

916
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,480
might have used decades ago but we

917
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,240
really have phases of zero trust

918
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,919
because if i can trust the identity of

919
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,320
the user device

920
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,760
and then grant access then i'm going to

921
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,918
limit the false

922
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,080
access to things that they might not be

923
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:54,080
allowed to do

924
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,678
if i have to be able to go and tell you

925
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,639
how do i support a mobile and remote

926
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,360
workforce

927
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,760
microsoft had to learn from this we

928
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,320
wanted to make sure that

929
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,760
as you implement this how questions you

930
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,399
could ask yourself

931
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,840
how do i how do i allow external behind

932
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,479
that corporate environment

933
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,000
can i allow how am i going to build this

934
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,679
out who owns

935
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,320
the customer experience well it should

936
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:20,159
be i.t and you should be able to use

937
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,320
this as a checklist to help you

938
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,080
and then finally we have a what we call

939
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,559
zero trust framework

940
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,480
uh where you're looking at not just

941
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,360
everybody thinks eurotrust identity is a

942
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,440
person

943
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,120
it can be a device an application it

944
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,240
could be a data entity

945
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,000
it could be the infrastructure a lot of

946
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,000
bots that are out there were written by

947
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,760
somebody in code but it's not a person

948
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,320
trying to break into your system it's an

949
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,919
app

950
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,879
and we need to be able to do that zero

951
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:49,919
trust across that environment as well

952
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,679
and on time i i will give the rest of

953
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,200
the slides but are there any questions

954
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,159
comments happy to answer those in the

955
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,760
time we have left

956
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,880
thank you very much hey thank you sean

957
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,799
so much

958
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,480
uh we do have some question already in q

959
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:04,480
a if anyone has some other questions

960
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,320
please uh submit them now

961
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,480
um the first question we have for you

962
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,639
sean is from chris

963
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,360
how does the push for federal logins or

964
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,960
identities interact with segmentation

965
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,120
it appears to be the ultimate form of

966
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,559
password reuse whereas single

967
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,879
admittedly hopefully harder to

968
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,960
compromise authorization

969
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,880
now gives access to multiple resource

970
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,000
across different otherwise isolated

971
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,840
segments

972
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,840
different passwords kind of

973
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:36,480
so i'm going to actually pull up a

974
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,200
drawing that i didn't pull up before

975
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,720
when we look at uh that multi-factor

976
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,480
authentication is critical

977
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,480
if you're going to have zero trust you

978
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:48,640
have to have that mfa in place

979
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,440
uh when i uh if okay i have my corporate

980
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,519
device

981
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,440
and i had to get access to it on my

982
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:56,080
phone i had to enroll my phone

983
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,279
i had to go to a trusted device first i

984
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,960
authenticate

985
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,240
to the device i don't authenticate to

986
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,840
the network so i'm not going through an

987
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,440
exchange server somewhere saying sean

988
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,158
anderson's trying to log into the back

989
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,640
end

990
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,360
i've got to do an encrypted setup

991
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,559
session with

992
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,240
ad on my device and then they say okay

993
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,600
that's a trusted device sean's now

994
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,600
trusted to the device

995
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,719
let's let him have access i had to then

996
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,039
go to a url

997
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,600
an edge device so to speak a web page

998
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:24,640
and i had to enter my cell phone number

999
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,279
then i get a phone call on my phone and

1000
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,440
my

1001
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:29,440
answer and it says hey so and so is

1002
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,320
trying to set this device up enter a pin

1003
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,320
number

1004
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,918
so there's a lot of different ways that

1005
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,559
things have to be verified

1006
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,120
and at no point did i use a password i'm

1007
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,559
using

1008
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,199
the accesses and the different

1009
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,639
methodologies to get access and then the

1010
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,200
system is verifying

1011
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,360
so now i enter my pin number it now

1012
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,120
recognizes yes this is sean's phone

1013
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,879
my phone can now be enrolled and then

1014
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,678
i'm off and running on a new approved

1015
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,159
device

1016
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,120
i and and so i've implemented hello on

1017
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,120
my computer

1018
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,320
i have multi-factor authentication set

1019
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,120
up in the environment

1020
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,279
i've set up cloud app security as well

1021
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,600
to be able to go to those applications

1022
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:07,360
and then i have defender or i have the

1023
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,960
security of credential guard device

1024
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,440
guard on my computer

1025
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:15,199
and i have that holistic environment to

1026
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:18,480
create that zero trust experience

1027

1029
