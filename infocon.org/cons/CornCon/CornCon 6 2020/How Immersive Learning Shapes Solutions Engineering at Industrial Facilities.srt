1
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,080
good morning track two

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,439
uh welcome back for those that left uh

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:26,320
here we have uh about to start up mr

4
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:29,279
george simmons

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,080
uh he's gonna give an awesome talk about

6
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,079
the new cyber

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,839
engineer how immersive learning shapes

8
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,440
solution engineering and industrial

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,000
facilities

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,920
um and again please remember to purchase

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,520
some merch and join us at discord

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,280
without further ado george i'll hand it

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,920
over to you

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,440
awesome well good morning everybody here

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,680
i'm going to

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,160
share my screen with you guys so that

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,719
you can see the presentation

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,519
i kind of feel like uh mr rogers a

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,640
little bit

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:03,199
uh being able to sit in a chair and uh

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,760
and also do a a presentation at the same

22
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,320
time

23
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,960
so anyway it's good to be here this

24
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,439
morning as a second time being able to

25
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,080
join you at corncon i love these

26
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,759
conferences

27
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,759
they have to be the most creative i've

28
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,680
ever attended i

29
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,000
wanted to talk a little bit today about

30
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,400
what i call the new cyber engineer

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,439
and what that really means are engineers

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,320
that are

33
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,919
working and performing job functions at

34
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,279
industrial facilities

35
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,280
and really how we use immersive learning

36
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,960
to kind of shape the way they engineer

37
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,560
solutions in these really

38
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,640
kind of difficult or challenging

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,920
environments

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,439
so a little bit about isis it's a 501c6

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,600
it's a non-profit

42
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,000
and what we specialize in is workforce

43
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,520
development and really research as well

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,759
in cyber security

45
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,640
and critical infrastructure and that's a

46
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,560
lot i know

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,680
to put in one sentence or what have you

48
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,960
but the truth is

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,360
we really need a way in order to

50
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,399
do this cross-disciplinary approach

51
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,040
between cyber and the engineering

52
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:08,399
disciplines

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,800
in terms of how we carry out uh

54
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,480
you know cyber based programs in these

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,720
these types of facilities

56
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,799
and to give you an example over on the

57
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,160
right that's a

58
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,200
a picture of a really a small modular

59
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,400
reactor a small

60
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,720
nuclear reactor that's a part of our lab

61
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,080
and and what you see in there is you

62
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,920
might be able to tell

63
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,920
there's some wiring and what not going

64
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,839
on but there's a lot of digital

65
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,079
components inside of this uh

66
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,599
particular lab that's a little bit

67
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,800
different from what you'll see in a

68
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,760
traditional i.t

69
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,840
environment and also it gets a bit

70
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,120
confusing because unlike walking into a

71
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,800
traditional

72
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,519
data center you're walking into a power

73
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,800
plant

74
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,840
or a large industrial space so how this

75
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,400
stuff works and

76
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,239
how you come together as a team to make

77
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,959
sure it's protected from cyber based

78
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,360
threats

79
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,040
it's just very different so how do we

80
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,040
get to a place where

81
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,359
individuals who are trained or otherwise

82
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,239
interested in a cyber career

83
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,440
learn how to you know apply their skills

84
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,440
in a place like this

85
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,159
so a lot of ways i think about you know

86
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,040
cyber security as a whole and as a

87
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,280
discipline

88
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,239
i would think you know if i were sick or

89
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,480
ill

90
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,599
where would i want to go in order to

91
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,079
seek treatment

92
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,040
and what if i went back in time to like

93
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,159
the 19th

94
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,959
century and if i had a choice between

95
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,280
getting health care in the 19th century

96
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,920
to getting health care in today's modern

97
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,480
age

98
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,000
which would i choose and some of these

99
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,480
pictures here are kind of

100
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,840
a graphic to to kind of give you an idea

101
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,159
of what it was like

102
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,319
back in the 19th century and some

103
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:56,319
describe it as somewhat barbaric

104
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:58,720
but really as as a as a as

105
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,280
a society and as a culture we really

106
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,680
didn't have a whole lot of innovation

107
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,879
or we were still in the learning process

108
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,280
about how to

109
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,120
implement these disciplines in ways that

110
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,720
promoted good health care

111
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,480
or the patient safety or what have you

112
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,840
i'll give you an idea there so think

113
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,599
about this

114
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:23,120
the first hospital was actually

115
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,800
established in the united states in 1751

116
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,360
this was in philadelphia it was called

117
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,040
the

118
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,759
the philadelphia hospital so that's 1751

119
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,919
that's almost a little over

120
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:36,320
250 years ago or what have you but when

121
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,120
we get into a hundred years ahead of

122
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,159
that

123
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,240
in the mid-19th century or so they said

124
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,120
according to the washington post

125
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,560
the chances of post-surgery survival

126
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,120
were so low

127
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,639
that hospitals often force patients to

128
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,479
pay up front

129
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,720
so imagine that imagine if you're going

130
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,320
in for a routine procedure or you have

131
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,080
some sort of emergency

132
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,000
and the doctors are saying i need you to

133
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,440
pay up front because there's no way i

134
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,840
can guarantee you're going to come out

135
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,280
of this

136
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,440
and in good shape and also at the time

137
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,559
even more interestingly they weren't

138
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,840
really sure

139
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,360
how to do something as simple as blood

140
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,679
transfusions

141
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,639
they actually believed at that time that

142
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,720
you could use

143
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:23,759
milk as a way to um

144
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,800
transfuse or to or to

145
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:30,400
to transfuse blood uh in order to save

146
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,080
sick sick patients so there was a brief

147
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,840
in what they call bizarre time

148
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,919
in the late 19th century when they were

149
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,039
convinced that milk was the perfect

150
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,599
substitute

151
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,719
for lost blood and that's pretty

152
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,400
interesting

153
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:47,199
in many ways so if you think about that

154
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,080
from a cyber discipline we're not that

155
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,960
far off

156
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,080
in terms of it's relatively a new

157
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,280
discipline

158
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,359
and when you think about where

159
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,080
technology has come over the past

160
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,919
20 or 30 years we're still at a place

161
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,840
where we're trying to figure out

162
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:05,680
how exactly do we go about implementing

163
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,318
protective measures and defensive

164
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,560
strategies in ways that really work

165
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,560
so in a lot of ways we're experimenting

166
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,759
and we're trying to figure out

167
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,199
what would work best so let's take a

168
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,080
look at that

169
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,840
so you may be familiar with nist the

170
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,960
national institute of standards and

171
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,520
technology

172
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,440
and they have what's called the 800

173
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,758
series publications

174
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,800
and many of you may already be aware of

175
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,680
that but

176
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,919
back in 2005 they published this thing

177
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,199
called the 853

178
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:42,159
and what that was is a is a catalog

179
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,360
of security controls and a methodology

180
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,520
to implement them

181
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,120
that essentially said here's how here's

182
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,758
all the things you should do or think

183
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,240
about

184
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,000
to protect an asset or to protect a

185
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,319
digital device

186
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,520
around the same time and there was

187
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,840
another publication called the 882

188
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,840
which was essentially a way of taking

189
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,000
853 all these security controls

190
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,520
and applying them in an industrial

191
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,960
environment

192
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,960
so the 882 the idea that we could

193
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,080
actually protect industrial control

194
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,599
systems while not

195
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,000
new it and putting a formal guideline in

196
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,039
place

197
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,319
started around the same time as all this

198
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:27,759
emphasis on federal i.t systems

199
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:31,440
and dod systems so

200
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:35,039
in the end the draft of the 882

201
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:37,440
starting sometime in 2005 and 2006

202
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,159
it would be almost a half dozen years

203
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,120
later

204
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,599
before the first iteration comes out

205
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,120
that's

206
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:48,080
you know six or so years after

207
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,199
the 853 came out it took a while to

208
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,000
figure out

209
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,120
what is the best way to take these best

210
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,039
practices

211
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,160
and implement them in an industrial

212
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,960
facility

213
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,039
and skipping ahead the last revision of

214
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:05,120
that was in 2015

215
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:08,080
whereas the 853 for federal systems

216
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,080
was just revised here recently in 2020

217
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,318
and the 882 for industrial

218
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,840
focus is also in process it's always in

219
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,240
a process of being updated

220
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,560
but it kind of gives you an idea of what

221
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,800
i would call the cyber lag

222
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,039
and really what that has to do with is

223
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,840
that when we start talking

224
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,440
about applying cyber security in these

225
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,080
industrial environments

226
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,680
it's actually a little bit harder and

227
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,039
there's a reason for that which we're

228
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,360
going to talk about

229
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,240
but the idea that we that we are trying

230
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,240
as an industry to improve and mature

231
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,599
we're kind of in this interesting time

232
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,080
when we get to

233
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,800
witness it and be a part of it just like

234
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,360
back in the

235
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:51,279
18 the 19th century whenever doctors and

236
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,800
practitioners were trying to hone their

237
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,360
skills and improve

238
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,680
patient care we're at a place where we

239
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,920
have an opportunity to do the same thing

240
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,359
we're not healing people but we're

241
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,959
certainly protecting

242
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,640
and playing an important role in

243
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,839
protecting the nation's critical

244
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,040
infrastructure

245
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:13,279
especially understanding how digitized

246
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,279
that infrastructure really is

247
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,519
so i'll give you an example here so we

248
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,920
call it

249
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,560
a soft gui center with a hard outer

250
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,360
shell

251
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,599
i mean everyone growing up has probably

252
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,200
had experience with a gobstopper

253
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,120
i mean this is something you give to a

254
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,360
kid and they essentially are

255
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,120
you know busy for at least a half an

256
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,360
hour or more

257
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,680
well a gobstopper is very similar to

258
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,839
what we would call the purdue model

259
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:45,279
for industrial automation

260
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:48,320
and what that means is over time

261
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,800
over the past 30 to 40 years or so

262
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,640
we've seen more and more automation and

263
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,760
industrial environments

264
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:59,040
but keep in mind the types of automation

265
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:02,240
the types of digital digitization

266
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,160
have not necessarily kept in pace from a

267
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,279
security perspective

268
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,480
and so if you break a plant or

269
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,560
manufacturing facility or what not down

270
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,680
there's really about five different

271
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,640
levels

272
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,760
to the architecture as a whole at the

273
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,000
highest level

274
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,000
you have the enterprise networks when

275
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,920
this is where your business systems are

276
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,600
and your email systems and the things

277
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,560
that you're kind of accustomed to for

278
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,440
day-to-day

279
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,599
work activities but as you drill down

280
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,160
all the way down to level zero

281
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,120
you have these industrial automation

282
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,680
components

283
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,040
industrial control systems scada

284
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,040
architectures

285
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,480
things that are very different from

286
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,040
traditional i.t

287
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,040
that are running critical processes in a

288
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,439
plant these are things that can be

289
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,279
making decisions that have a massive

290
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,160
impact on the plant's ability to

291
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,800
function

292
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,760
and in some cases in the worst case

293
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,079
scenario

294
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,839
you're talking about pieces of equipment

295
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,160
that are making decisions that could

296
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,360
have

297
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:06,399
impacts on everything from human life

298
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,959
to environmental concerns

299
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,600
when we have massive pipes that are

300
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,399
pumping

301
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,279
you know thousands of gallons of water

302
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,399
at a time

303
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,600
superheated infrastructure caustic

304
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,440
materials

305
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,600
all these things that are happening at

306
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,279
once you really want to make sure that

307
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,640
that technology is doing what it's

308
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,439
supposed to be doing

309
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,000
and the main emphasis as a result is

310
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,360
that it

311
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,120
it basically be designed and implemented

312
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,079
with the highest levels of

313
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,160
functional integrity and so all these

314
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,399
other features and functions in this

315
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,040
technology that would otherwise equate

316
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,200
to

317
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,319
you know things that you you know a user

318
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,600
might like more

319
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,079
or even security were kept out because

320
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,519
they didn't want to introduce complexity

321
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,040
into the architecture

322
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,279
because that means that we would we're

323
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,319
more we would be would be more likely to

324
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,800
have a failure mode or a failure state

325
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,920
that would be unpredictable and so as

326
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,880
you drill down

327
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,800
into that process layer we have a lot of

328
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,920
simple

329
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,000
what we call non-native components

330
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,160
meaning they don't have any native

331
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,760
capability to actually protect

332
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,160
themselves

333
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,480
and when we talk about the timelines

334
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,880
here about when nist was publishing

335
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,160
and putting out these guidelines i'll

336
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,160
give you an example

337
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:31,680
so back in 2001 after 9 11

338
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,519
we had a series of regulations

339
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,359
and requirements that got pushed out to

340
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:40,720
the nuclear power industry

341
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:42,480
and between 2001 and 2006

342
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,760
really that was what we would call risk

343
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,600
based meaning

344
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,200
someone got to make a decision as to

345
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,560
whether the rick would risk was

346
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,200
significant enough

347
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,000
to actually take action and what they

348
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,399
what the regulator found in 2006

349
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,399
is that there everyone just basically

350
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,120
considered there to be very little

351
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,000
to no risk which wasn't actually the

352
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,440
case

353
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,639
and so in 2009 they actually came out

354
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,160
and said well we're going to

355
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,399
we're actually going to formalize a

356
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,920
regulation and make it a requirement so

357
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,720
there isn't a choice we're going to take

358
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,639
risk out of the equation and make sure

359
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,760
that everyone's doing these things

360
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,839
but it took from 2009 to today to really

361
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,560
begin maturing and what that means is

362
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,800
that

363
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,319
even though we knew there was a problem

364
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,880
at the turn of the century

365
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,639
it's taken almost 20 years to get an

366
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,600
industry at the place where they're

367
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,720
formally adopting these you know these

368
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,920
more

369
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,760
uh capable cyber um um

370
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,079
solutions and what have you pushing what

371
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,880
we call situational awareness

372
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,079
for cyber security deeper and deeper

373
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,240
into the plan

374
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,239
where these industrial control

375
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,120
components are operating

376
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,880
so so why is that why did it take so

377
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,000
long

378
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,760
well that's where we come to the

379
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,560
multiple multi multi-disciplinary expert

380
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,639
really the issue that we face is that

381
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,279
when you get into the plant and you

382
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,560
have to start introducing cyber

383
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,560
technologies

384
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,079
what you find is a certain level of

385
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,479
disruption

386
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,120
most of the equipment in a plant is what

387
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,240
we call

388
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,199
run to failure it means you imp you

389
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,680
install it or you

390
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,760
implement it and then you you only touch

391
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,920
it maybe in two to three year cycles

392
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,240
during when a plant shut down

393
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,279
or it doesn't undergo regular patch

394
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,600
management

395
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,040
and in some cases this equipment is

396
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,199
really old

397
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,040
i wish i could show you guys pictures of

398
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,479
some of the stuff that we've seen when

399
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,680
we're out there doing

400
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,959
um evaluations of these plants we're

401
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,519
talking about

402
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,518
technologies that are you know for which

403
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,000
the vendors have gone out of business

404
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,720
you know a decade ago we're talking

405
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,160
about

406
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,760
in one case i had the pleasure of seeing

407
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,160
probably something that should belong in

408
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:01,680
a museum but it was a

409
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:05,600
hard drive that was about the size of a

410
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:07,680
a bureau or a sofa that had these large

411
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,560
platters that were probably

412
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,239
you know as big as my fireplace but this

413
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,279
stuff has just been there for a long

414
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,120
long time

415
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,199
but it's one of those if it doesn't if

416
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,040
it works and it's not broken

417
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,319
then you don't touch it and you keep

418
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,959
moving forward

419
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,680
they'll pull people out of retirement to

420
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,719
come in

421
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,959
and actually maintain these systems

422
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,839
if you want to get access to some of the

423
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,000
systems

424
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,279
you actually have to get permission from

425
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,160
about four different

426
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,519
layers of engineering approval just to

427
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,680
open a cabinet

428
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,639
and if you open the cabinet you can't

429
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,479
break the plane

430
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,079
which means you can't actually reach

431
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,720
your hand into the cabinet

432
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:49,519
or shine a flashlight into it because

433
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,000
the equipment can be so sensitive

434
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,519
so that's why it takes so long because

435
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,680
the amount of

436
00:15:53,519 --> 00:16:00,079
of planning and um

437
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,160
and strategic planning really to get in

438
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,439
there and actually do this type of work

439
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,880
or put cyber

440
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,399
into these spaces really just takes time

441
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,240
and that's because over to the left

442
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,240
you'll see there's so many different

443
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,040
types of disciplines that have to be in

444
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,839
play

445
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,680
in order to achieve that end result you

446
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,959
have to have a cyber engineer

447
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,959
you got to have a someone who

448
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,959
understands physical security

449
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,800
and kind of like you know maybe travis

450
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,239
who was presenting earlier would be the

451
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,399
best candidate for right

452
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,279
these are physical security you know

453
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,000
individuals who

454
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,759
understand you know not traditional

455
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,920
physical security but

456
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,040
a lot of them are former military they

457
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,599
carry with them

458
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,160
high value are high-powered weapons

459
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,880
they're

460
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,920
you know trained in military tactics and

461
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,959
they actually

462
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,279
undergo force on force type exercises

463
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,119
to test and and verify that these

464
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:54,639
physical protections are in place

465
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,079
it is its own specialized field

466
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,720
then you have things like plant

467
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:01,040
operations these are individuals who sit

468
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,959
in a control room and are monitoring

469
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,599
all the processes that are happening in

470
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:08,958
the plant and that takes years

471
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:10,000
to train for and then on top of that you

472
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,600
have all the different

473
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,839
engineering disciplines that are

474
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,678
involved from electrical engineering

475
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,678
mechanical engineering

476
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,120
and all the digital instrumentation and

477
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,600
control folks

478
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,678
these are the individuals who are

479
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:26,079
responsible for the design

480
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,839
configuration and what have you of all

481
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,440
the digital components that are a part

482
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,360
of these processes

483
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,640
and think about the level of integrity

484
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,879
that goes behind that

485
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,160
in terms of the way they're configured

486
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,679
because they're making

487
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,280
again they're sensing or making

488
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,760
decisions about or helping an

489
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,399
operator make decisions about how we

490
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,440
move

491
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:48,640
you know large inventories of coolant or

492
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,559
you know how we redirect um

493
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,480
certain things within the plant in order

494
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,000
to to make make sure it's it's

495
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,919
functioning smoothly and it's

496
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,760
the plant and these processes are

497
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,360
constantly being tuned

498
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,600
and so someone's out there making sure

499
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,760
that the digital components are actually

500
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,080
from a functional perspective doing

501
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,679
their jobs and giving the operators the

502
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,120
right decisions to make

503
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,880
and then you have the maintenance folks

504
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,399
who are going out there and modifying

505
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,240
and configuring and

506
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,840
and troubleshooting and tuning those

507
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,440
components as well

508
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:22,000
well all of that today is cyber

509
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,600
because you can't implement cyber

510
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
security without having

511
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,678
all of at least some knowledge of all of

512
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,320
these aspects

513
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,200
and be able to work with them in order

514
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,399
to implement

515
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,240
cyber effectively at a plant if

516
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,840
eighty percent of all the digital

517
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,200
components in a plant

518
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:44,480
are air-gapped or otherwise isolated

519
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,120
they can't they can't be connected to or

520
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,440
they can't be

521
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,639
touched they can't be patched in some

522
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,799
cases

523
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,799
you can't even get in physical proximity

524
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,840
to them imagine if they're in a part of

525
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,080
the plant where

526
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,520
it's a it's a high level of human risk

527
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,520
to even access it

528
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,120
like in a high radiation environment at

529
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,840
a nuclear power plant

530
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,760
that means you've got as a cyber analyst

531
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,240
or an engineer you've got to understand

532
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,280
how

533
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,480
physical security mitigates

534
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,639
and completely mitigates the risk

535
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,919
that a cyber threat would otherwise pose

536
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,320
to that component

537
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,080
and that's tricky but now you've got to

538
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,720
understand that discipline

539
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,000
but in order to to really quantify risks

540
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,480
you've got to understand what that

541
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,280
component is you got to understand what

542
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,280
process

543
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,280
it's supporting you got to understand

544
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,280
the importance of that process to the

545
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,320
overall plant operation

546
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,639
and you have to be able to

547
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,960
to implement mitigation strategies that

548
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,240
don't disrupt that operation

549
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:47,360
in some cases we have components that

550
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,400
if they were to fail through compromise

551
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,719
or what have you

552
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,160
it could shut the plant down which would

553
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,480
cost the plant money

554
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,679
it could disrupt a function which could

555
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,000
shut the plant down

556
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,919
and cost money and worse can that case

557
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,200
scenario it could hurt someone

558
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:05,360
and otherwise um lead to

559
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,799
uh what we might call a catastrophic

560
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,120
risk

561
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:11,520
so what does this what does it what does

562
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,639
a cyber expert really look like then in

563
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,760
the future

564
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,840
if we if we're not necessarily so i t

565
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,080
focused but we got to take all of these

566
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:24,000
other things into consideration

567
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,000
where do we build this expert

568
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,600
and that's where these partnerships come

569
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,039
into play because

570
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,280
in reality no one organization can do it

571
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,158
so you have universities involved

572
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,879
because we're

573
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,320
producing the leaders of tomorrow

574
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,840
through the university system the

575
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,000
workforce of tomorrow

576
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,320
but we also need private industry

577
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,840
involved this is everyone from the

578
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,480
owners and operators

579
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,240
of these facilities to the large

580
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,200
organizations that support them like a

581
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,240
raytheon

582
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,360
but we also need the vendors to be

583
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,480
involved as well

584
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:01,360
the tenables the pfps these types of

585
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,760
companies that specialize in cyber

586
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,520
in these tough environments and when we

587
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,158
bring them all together we got to say

588
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,120
look

589
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,960
how do we overcome this problem because

590
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,559
we have a significant

591
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:17,520
need out in industry for

592
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,639
for building this workforce and so

593
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,600
ultimately

594
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,280
how do we build them how do we make

595
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,879
someone today who's sitting in a

596
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,200
sophomore class

597
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,600
at harvard university who wants to

598
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,600
specialize in cyber security

599
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,439
understand what they're getting into

600
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,240
especially if their future employer is

601
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,080
going to be like an

602
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:40,240
exelon or a dominion power

603
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,360
well we we believe is you need to give

604
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,440
them access

605
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,399
to what we call an immersion-based

606
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,400
environment

607
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,600
you've got to give them you got to put

608
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,320
them in a place

609
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,280
where they can experience real time what

610
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,080
it's like to be

611
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,080
out there in these facilities and you

612
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,480
see a picture there of the facility we

613
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,600
have in forest virginia like i said

614
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,559
that's a full-scale

615
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,559
modular power plant all the industrial

616
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,600
control systems and scada systems are

617
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,678
embedded in

618
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,158
but the nice thing about it is we can

619
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,640
break it meaning if you go in there and

620
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:15,679
you do something that's invasive

621
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,919
and it breaks or it creates an issue you

622
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,559
can easily set back to zero

623
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,840
and there's no impact to the operation

624
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,960
of the plant

625
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,559
so we can be a little more creative

626
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,080
and we can make mistakes in an

627
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,960
environment like this

628
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,879
even though the environment is emulating

629
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,080
what's happening out there in the rest

630
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,840
of critical infrastructure that's not to

631
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,199
say that we are eliminating all the

632
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,959
safety issues

633
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,880
because we still have risks these are

634
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,880
still operating components

635
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,440
these are still things that require us

636
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,679
to have a high level of due diligence

637
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,600
the same way we would have in a plant

638
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,000
but at the same time

639
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,320
it's it it makes sure that the students

640
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,240
understand it so for example

641
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,439
we would teach students how to give

642
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,240
safety briefs

643
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,159
before even entering the facility so

644
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,679
they know how to communicate with one

645
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,520
another and their teams

646
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,760
for things to look out for when they're

647
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,600
in the plant like loose clothing

648
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,919
having the right personal protective

649
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,559
equipment and things like that

650
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,720
getting to the technology is one thing

651
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,158
but being able to be in these

652
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,480
these organizations and these

653
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:25,280
environments in a safe way

654
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,960
is also equally important because the

655
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,440
the risks are a bit higher

656
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,799
in that regard you might you know have

657
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,480
the risk of tripping

658
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,158
or otherwise you know running into

659
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,080
something in a data center

660
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,679
but in this facility you could touch

661
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,039
something that could burn you

662
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,000
you could uh hit your head on overhead

663
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,600
piping

664
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,440
there's a lot of things that you got to

665
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,199
look out for that otherwise you wouldn't

666
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,720
have to think about

667
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,200
and this picture gives you somewhat of

668
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,840
an example of that so in the top left

669
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,360
corner

670
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,959
that's what we call the component

671
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,279
cooling water system

672
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,039
and what that does is you have four

673
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,960
large industrial pumps

674
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:03,279
which are pulling into in water

675
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,080
inventory out of a big tank

676
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:08,000
and we pump that water through out the

677
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,480
lab or throughout the range

678
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
and so in this small modular reactor we

679
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,080
pull the water out so if the

680
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,520
reactor were operating and we were

681
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,799
producing steam

682
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,760
or superheated water we would need to

683
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,639
pull the heat

684
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,158
off of those systems and so just like a

685
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,799
radiator in a car

686
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:29,200
you gotta basically push coolant all the

687
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,760
way through the system to pull that heat

688
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,400
off

689
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,760
and that recycles through as the hot

690
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,159
water comes out

691
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,879
it cools off and then gets pushed back

692
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,240
in

693
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:43,200
well that's a massive industrial control

694
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,039
system in and of itself and so a lot of

695
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,960
training courses this is where students

696
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:49,520
can sit and find out

697
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,840
you know what's working how is the

698
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,158
digital aspect of it the architecture of

699
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,879
it

700
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,240
what can i see what is it telling me and

701
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,120
how would a threat actor

702
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,919
impact that because if it were to break

703
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,760
then my whole plant shuts down

704
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,679
at the bottom left you see the core

705
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,960
that's where we superheat the water

706
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,120
and you'll see different types of

707
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,760
instrumentation in there what does that

708
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,678
look like

709
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,879
how do you get to it how does it

710
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,120
communicate

711
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,559
what are the specialized protocols that

712
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,039
that

713
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,039
that come into play and how do we make

714
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:23,520
sure that while we're accessing it

715
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,480
how is it disrupting the operators what

716
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,879
are they seeing

717
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,320
do we have you know the right people in

718
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,600
the room with us

719
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,840
so do we need to build you know

720
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,678
expertise from the engineering group in

721
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,799
other words do we train engineers to be

722
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,799
cyber people

723
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,480
or do we train cyber people to go into

724
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:43,360
engineering environments

725
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,520
whichever approach we take you just see

726
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,080
that there's a bit of a different type

727
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,799
of approach overall that needs to be

728
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,120
taken

729
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,720
so that when we get into the environment

730
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,039
we can do what we need to do

731
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,840
without posing risk to the plant or to

732
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,840
other people

733
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,400
so what if we can't get into the plant

734
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,120
itself for whatever reason

735
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,240
let's say it's operating it's 140

736
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,918
degrees in there

737
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,480
you don't want to be in there or we're

738
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:13,840
doing other types of

739
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,480
of experimentation in that space

740
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,439
that's where the ai-based virtual ranges

741
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,159
come in

742
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,720
how can we through a virtual environment

743
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:26,000
expose a student to the same

744
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,279
types of of conditions as they would see

745
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,320
in real life

746
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:33,520
but through in a simulated way and so

747
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:36,000
what we use is these ai based

748
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,679
training grounds where they students are

749
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,159
immersed into missions

750
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,279
and they have something on the other end

751
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,240
that's measuring

752
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,279
the level of skill uh knowledge and

753
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,880
abilities

754
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:52,240
and then using that to

755
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,240
change the the game play so that

756
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,600
they're progressively moving up in their

757
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,240
skill sets

758
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,480
so the key thing is making sure that

759
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,799
it's as real life as possible

760
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,039
so scenario building inside of these

761
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:07,360
environments is another key piece

762
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:09,919
but what's nice is that you can actually

763
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,240
access it from anywhere in the world

764
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,120
so you don't have to necessarily put on

765
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,919
a hard hat

766
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,719
protective glasses you know hearing

767
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,120
protection

768
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,000
and you know composite toe boots you can

769
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,080
sit in the comfort

770
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,120
of your own room dressed any way you

771
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,279
want to be dressed

772
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,799
and start learning and understanding how

773
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,799
to work in these environments

774
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:33,760
so what that comes down to is regardless

775
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,120
of whether you have a physical space or

776
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,080
a physical lab

777
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,520
or if you have a virtual range the goal

778
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,360
is to get students

779
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,679
immersed into these types of

780
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,279
environments and one example was what we

781
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,799
were looking at in

782
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:50,799
south carolina so what that was is

783
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,399
central carolina technical college for

784
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,080
example and there are other examples

785
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:57,600
throughout the united states

786
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:59,600
they have a focus on manufacturing

787
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,719
and so they have a manufacturing

788
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,039
laboratory

789
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,320
where they teach and train students in a

790
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,640
two-year program

791
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,200
how to get jobs into work in technical

792
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,200
positions in the manufacturing industry

793
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,279
at the same time we have morris college

794
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,279
which is located right there as well

795
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,799
that is building a four-year program in

796
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,640
cyber security

797
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,039
so working with someone like raytheon

798
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,039
one of the nation's largest employers

799
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:25,039
we started asking the questions how do

800
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:27,440
we pull these two together

801
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,120
so that those who are learning cyber can

802
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,000
be in the same environment as the

803
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,678
technicians and

804
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,760
operators who are going to be going out

805
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,840
into the manufacturing field

806
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,799
and can we pull these disciplines

807
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,720
together

808
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,559
so that everyone is kind of learning in

809
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,480
the same environment

810
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,760
whether you're an engineer who wants to

811
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,159
understand cyber

812
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,600
or cyber who wants to understand the

813
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,240
engineering discipline

814
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,520
you're doing now that in an academic

815
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,080
setting

816
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:55,039
and the reason for that is because if we

817
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,559
think about it

818
00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:01,760
right now there's about jobs

819
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:03,760
that are going unfilled work worldwide

820
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,120
and when you think about the things that

821
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,279
that uh

822
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,559
these employers are looking for what

823
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:12,000
they believe is about

824
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:14,559
36 of all the the cyber

825
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,080
skill out there lack the skills and

826
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,720
experience needed to be

827
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,320
you know effective in their field think

828
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,039
about that that's like one in

829
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,200
three but when we were talking earlier

830
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,000
about the risks that are inherent to

831
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,159
working in these

832
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,320
environments you really don't want the

833
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,120
third one in every three people on your

834
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,960
team

835
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,959
going out into the plant because that

836
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,360
introduces a manifold

837
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,640
risk right both to their safety the

838
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,840
safety of others

839
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:44,799
and the in the operation of the plant

840
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,959
um so what we want to get past is what

841
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:49,600
we believe today is really what we call

842
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,240
novice to journeyman level experience in

843
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,080
cyber

844
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,640
especially when it comes to working in

845
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,799
industrial security

846
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,039
but what's interesting is that about 40

847
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:02,080
percent of those in the cyber field

848
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,720
have a master's degree so think about

849
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,639
that

850
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,960
getting through a formal program of

851
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,799
study these students aren't coming out

852
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,799
necessarily being able to

853
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,879
walk into these environments and be

854
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:15,039
effective but we think with this

855
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,919
immersive level emphasis

856
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:19,279
the opposite would be true so if someone

857
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,799
goes through our training

858
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,679
or someone goes through one of these

859
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:25,600
programs with a participating university

860
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,760
when they go out to interview at a plant

861
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,678
or they go out to work at a plant

862
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,600
they're already doing the things that

863
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,720
would be expected of them

864
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,240
if they were an or a regular engineer so

865
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,440
they're going to show up with the right

866
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,760
type of clothing

867
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,279
they're going to stop and read the signs

868
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,879
in the plant so that they don't push the

869
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,559
door that they shouldn't push or touch

870
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,679
something they shouldn't touch

871
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,440
they're going to have all their

872
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,360
protective equipment with them they're

873
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,640
going to be ready to give safety briefs

874
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,479
and when they walk through these

875
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,200
environments they're going to understand

876
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,360
how to interpret what's going on and

877
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,360
translate what's happening in the field

878
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,399
to what's happening in the digital

879
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,519
architecture

880
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:06,000
as well so

881
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,000
with that i'll i'll close it out but

882
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,640
really the main things to keep in mind

883
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,799
here

884
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,559
is that i think as an industry and

885
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,879
especially for those who are looking to

886
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,039
or

887
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,559
either in this industry or those who are

888
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,919
looking to get into it

889
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:20,720
we really need to focus on a more

890
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:22,000
interdisciplinary approach

891
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,760
especially when we're looking at

892
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,080
critical infrastructure

893
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,440
and we kind of pull industry in to help

894
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,120
everyone figure that out

895
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,519
we can't let you know institutions of

896
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,918
higher learning be on their own plane

897
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,840
and industry on a different plane and

898
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,799
cyber training organizations on a

899
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,559
different plane

900
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,320
we all have to come together to figure

901
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,720
out what does the workforce

902
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,240
really have to have and what do the

903
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,120
employers really need

904
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,919
and then build both education and

905
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,600
training

906
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:56,480
to meet those needs um and really

907
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,600
what that equates to for industrial

908
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,000
applications

909
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,080
is it's got to be immersive whether it's

910
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,440
in person or a live lab

911
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,559
where they're actually touching the

912
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,840
equipment to the virtual ranges that are

913
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,480
now available

914
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,559
use both of them to amplify what a

915
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,360
student is experiencing in a classroom

916
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,519
environment

917
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,399
and then using that to make them a

918
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,159
better product

919
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:22,239
in terms of a future employee

920
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,919
especially given what they're going to

921
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,519
face in the world

922
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:27,039
and so with that i'll open it up to

923
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,240
questions or comments

924
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:32,960
and uh and hopefully that'll um

925
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,960
