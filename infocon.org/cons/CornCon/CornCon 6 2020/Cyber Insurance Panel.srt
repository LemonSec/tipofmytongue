manage risk and they're going to talk

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,640
come by and watch us talk a little bit

36
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,479
about

37
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:48,000
what is going on in cyber insurance

38
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,920
not surprisingly um

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,520
this is a hot topic right now because of

40
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,960
all the ransomware that's been going

41
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,000
around and how

42
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,479
how prolific it's been so

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,520
but i have here with me today tim from

44
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,560
abfleck as

45
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,798
john pointed out and michael um

46
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,759
tim's a fellow cesa but michael brings a

47
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,920
different perspective

48
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,399
as a as a chief of claims for a couple

49
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,959
of big insurance companies before this

50
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,319
so i wanted to kind of round it out and

51
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,440
give

52
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,879
you all an insight to how cyber

53
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,640
insurance works or

54
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:26,079
doesn't work as the case may be uh today

55
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,920
anyway um i think we

56
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,840
we should probably kick it off with uh

57
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,280
talking about

58
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,319
you know um i'm from the 80s right

59
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,360
originally

60
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,440
and so talk about um uh

61
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,319
frankie goes to hollywood you know uh

62
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,959
what what is it good for

63
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,480
summer insurance what is it good for

64
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,000
what do you think tim

65
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,799
yeah i you know uh my we

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,280
i i've kind of come along a journey on

67
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,640
the whole concept of cyber insurance

68
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,040
you know very early in my cso career uh

69
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,839
you know i i kind of was of the opinion

70
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,760
that

71
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,319
um you know if i had the amount of money

72
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,840
that the premiums cost towards my

73
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,920
security program

74
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,200
i was kind of of the philosophy that i

75
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,640
could probably prevent

76
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,159
the the need for cyber insurance but as

77
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,359
i kind of progressed and

78
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,599
grew and and broadened my horizons a bit

79
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,720
i think it really is about financial

80
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,280
risk management

81
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,879
more than anything and and you know

82
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,920
public companies now

83
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,440
it's expected uh especially you know

84
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,280
members of the board

85
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,440
uh you know believe it's their fiduciary

86
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,640
responsibility to make sure that there's

87
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,519
coverage

88
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,319
and i you know and i so i've changed my

89
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,080
perspective

90
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,399
uh quite a bit about that so what's it

91
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,159
good for i think it's

92
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,159
you know it gives you a bit of a hedge

93
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,519
against the financial impact

94
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:56,319
i think i think there's an aspect of it

95
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,599
where it you know every year we go

96
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,679
through a review of our program with our

97
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:04,399
carriers and uh you know

98
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,720
uh not that you know within the

99
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,680
regulated industries insurance banking

100
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,599
etc

101
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,439
you need a whole lot of outside views

102
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,200
because you have a lot of outside view

103
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,439
anyway from the regulators

104
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,320
but it does give you a little bit of a a

105
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,440
perspective

106
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,238
on uh making sure that your program is

107
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,639
reasonable

108
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,440
and and because if it's not reasonable

109
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,240
uh then

110
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,880
your your premiums are going to reflect

111
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,880
that

112
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,120
so i i think in a broad view that's kind

113
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,360
of my my thoughts on it

114
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:38,320
okay we're good yeah michael i i

115
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,120
want to jump in um and i want to thank

116
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,120
john and tim

117
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,199
and mike i want to thank all of you for

118
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,680
letting an insurance lawyer in the room

119
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,360
and uh all of you on the on the zoom you

120
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,880
know your boos only make me

121
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,960
stronger so uh you know i i'm really

122
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,159
pleased and and and proud to get to chat

123
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,479
with all of you because

124
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,160
cyber insurance has been on a journey

125
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,719
not just through the ransomware epidemic

126
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,240
which i

127
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,000
you know i think we should we should

128
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,479
talk about in in detail

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,280
but over the last 15 or 20 years it's

130
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,520
since it was

131
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,198
created as a standalone and and

132
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,080
different type of insurance from other

133
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,199
types of commercial

134
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,240
insurance i think we are getting our sea

135
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,639
legs under us

136
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,240
right now so if you if you start with

137
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,280
the late 90s when the first cyber

138
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,400
policies were

139
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,000
so branded and were offering insurance

140
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,320
the risk transfer they were offering was

141
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,160
for uh potential liability for

142
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,000
technical people like yourself if you

143
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,520
made a mistake uh and also for

144
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,360
professionals who

145
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,280
carry confidential information and so

146
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,960
the origin the original policies

147
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,799
were just designed to offer defense

148
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,960
coverage aka pay for

149
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,960
even more lawyers to help resolve the

150
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,198
kinds of disputes that happen when you

151
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,239
manage information systems or lose

152
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,039
information

153
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,400
but over the last 15 years we've been

154
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,479
trying to make it a more

155
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,840
expansive product and it has been quite

156
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,039
successful and popular and

157
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,880
grown quite quickly in the cyber

158
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:00,000
insurance in the insurance market

159
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,680
uh what that means is uh paradoxically

160
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,199
is that the standards of underwriting

161
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,759
which i'd love to talk about with all of

162
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,360
you

163
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,960
have gone down we're all competing with

164
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,240
each other so we want to make it easy to

165
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,400
buy cyber insurance

166
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,840
so we don't ask uh tough questions and

167
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,679
uh the sales folks who

168
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,080
who try to make those deals come true

169
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,840
are not always uh cyber security experts

170
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,359
or looping in their cso

171
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,758
and so now that we get to this this

172
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,280
moment where ransomware truly is

173
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,120
more threatening the companies like the

174
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,520
ones you all secure uh

175
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,199
and more threatening to the god forbid

176
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,680
the insurance companies bottom lines as

177
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,360
well

178
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,520
we're reaching this interesting moment

179
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,000
where we have to be more responsive to

180
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,840
customer

181
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,199
needs as an insurance company and we

182
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,960
have to be smarter about it

183
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,560
from a security perspective uh you know

184
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,680
and so i'm really excited to talk about

185
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,199
that with you um as an as yeah that

186
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,319
villain uh insurance lawyer

187
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:51,680
too speaking of uh the perspective of

188
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,360
uh insurance being the villain um yeah

189
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,800
my original perspective on cyber

190
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,199
insurance was

191
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,560
was probably typical and that is that

192
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,680
there were

193
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,479
you know just a jillion loopholes in it

194
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,120
found a way for me to not get paid for a

195
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,680
thing

196
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,240
you know uh whatever that thing might

197
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,280
have been

198
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,880
and and i think um

199
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,559
you know i've since coming to rsa i've

200
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,599
learned that that's not entirely the

201
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,639
case

202
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:21,599
but but i also think that um

203
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,960
well most of us csos and security people

204
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,039
just don't know

205
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,000
that there's like this huge transition

206
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,479
in the insurance

207
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,080
industry especially regarding cyber

208
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,080
insurance where

209
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,318
that had been on a company's property

210
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,440
policy in the past

211
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:40,400
and and it just been covered there

212
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,960
um like in a silent way because it was

213
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,440
it was a loss that was just incurred

214
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,520
and people were covering it to some

215
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,719
degree

216
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,840
by for want of of mentioning right

217
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,440
and so um this insurance industry has a

218
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,840
term for this that i learned

219
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,680
it's called silent cyber and it's

220
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,280
basically cyber that's covered in the

221
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,879
property policy

222
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,960
um but you know really what they're

223
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,160
forcing the industry is forcing is the

224
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,599
separate right

225
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:14,160
of a separate cyber policy

226
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,440
all right now so the whole if you're

227
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,120
experiencing

228
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,560
that if you think you had insurance

229
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,479
before

230
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,560
and uh you know it was under you know

231
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,479
your cfo was letting the

232
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,800
property policy you could end up losing

233
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,359
it so it's definitely something to check

234
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,360
on

235
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,919
because that which was there before may

236
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,320
not be there for you later

237
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,000
tim i know when we talked before about

238
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,519
this you had some thoughts on

239
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,719
on exclusions and and retention and a

240
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,000
bunch of other different things so i'd

241
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,240
like to hear your thoughts

242
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,120
yeah the the one thing that i did find

243
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,040
interesting

244
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:52,080
uh is you know kind of reading through

245
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:55,839
uh the policy the coverage

246
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:58,000
um and i'm not a lawyer like michael

247
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,000
so i'm sure i'm going to butcher all

248
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,080
kinds of legal terms and

249
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,040
he'll cringe and we'll we'll get through

250
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,920
it but

251
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,519
but uh but at any rate my my concern was

252
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,240
always

253
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,240
you know what happens if we we need to

254
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,480
file a claim and find out oh my goodness

255
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,600
this is excluded or what happens

256
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,240
if you know they deem this a an act of

257
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,279
war

258
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,720
or a terrorist event or you know some of

259
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,640
those kinds of things

260
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,720
and then you know here here when we need

261
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,399
it most is not available to us

262
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,279
so uh i've gotten a lot more involved in

263
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,279
reading

264
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,560
you know reading that and reading

265
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,800
exclusions and

266
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,680
and really pressing our broker uh

267
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,040
especially

268
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,079
on um you know what's covered what's not

269
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,480
covered

270
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,800
what would surprise us you know i i did

271
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,519
find out that

272
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,120
you know without uh an additional

273
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,720
business interruption

274
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,200
uh clause writer

275
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,720
again whatever the right term is uh

276
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,959
without that

277
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,560
you know we could have an event that

278
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:06,399
would be a

279
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:09,439
cyber attack a destructive attack event

280
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,600
and we may not be covered uh you know

281
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,519
because we didn't have the right the

282
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,200
right kind of language in there

283
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:19,279
and uh and again i i think all

284
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,880
insurance companies you know there's

285
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,279
probably a common

286
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,200
uh what i i've learned at least for the

287
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,560
type of products we offer

288
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,040
you know when you kind of go through the

289
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,079
regulatory uh structure to

290
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,560
to offer a uh a product

291
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,599
uh that there is some commonality in

292
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,800
language there

293
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,240
driven by that but i i did find that you

294
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,719
know different companies have

295
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,600
different types of language around

296
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,839
exclusion

297
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,959
and around uh you know what what's

298
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,560
covered under

299
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,399
you know you know their core cyber

300
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,680
policy versus like i said business

301
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,720
interruption or

302
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,319
or other kinds of policy mike you you

303
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,800
pointed out earlier the

304
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,200
the property damage or the physical uh

305
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,240
policy and we did find out that you know

306
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:07,279
if if our data center went away

307
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,920
and under one scenario it might be

308
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,240
covered

309
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,560
if it went away because someone erased

310
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,240
all the files

311
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,599
that was a different coverage you know

312
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,320
so uh you know

313
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,320
trying to navigate that and i do think

314
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,640
if you're going to make it a part of

315
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,240
your risk management program and proffer

316
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,920
this you really have to

317
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,800
to know that and think through it and

318
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,680
really examine it i've since learned

319
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:34,240
coming here

320
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:36,880
that base policies look different

321
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,839
at different companies and sometimes you

322
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,760
need a

323
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,440
writer as you called it they they call

324
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,720
it an endorsement i'm learning

325
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,160
a language but but yeah

326
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,839
you really do have to read it right

327
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,079
because some company's

328
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,320
paper is just entirely different yeah

329
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,519
and those scenarios are for real of

330
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,200
course the ultimate

331
00:11:53,519 --> 00:12:00,240
exclusion is what they call

332
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,480
retention right yeah yeah um

333
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,480
we we would call it a deductible if we

334
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,560
were insuring a car

335
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,440
but that's kind of what it is right it's

336
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:12,479
it's the it's the

337
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,920
minimum level right that they they'll

338
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,760
begin to get involved at

339
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,160
right like so your your attention could

340
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,120
be a million dollar incident or

341
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,760
or what have you um even if it is

342
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,639
covered

343
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,519
right so that that is very important to

344
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,839
know because

345
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,200
uh you know if you if you look at the

346
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,200
data

347
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,279
uh from like the verizon data incident

348
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,600
report all the different costs of reach

349
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,600
report that ibm and polymon

350
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,360
uh partner together every year when you

351
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,399
start looking at those

352
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,720
the average cost of a a breach

353
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,560
would probably come under most companies

354
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,360
retention or at least the companies i've

355
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,040
been in

356
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,320
you know so that's a consideration what

357
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,120
the company's doing is kind of

358
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,040
self-insuring that part

359
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,880
and you know that's reasonable you know

360
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,439
you know obviously

361
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,720
you know the the lower the retention the

362
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,519
more expensive

363
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,839
the the product is right yeah just like

364
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,440
when you share your car

365
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,480
yeah absolutely true michael you were

366
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,800
going to say something

367
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,839
yeah i know well this conversation

368
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,599
brings out a couple of things i'd

369
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,519
highlight one is that

370
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,279
tim and mike you're exactly the kinds of

371
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,839
experts that need to be

372
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,680
more incorporated into the uh insurance

373
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,000
buying process and i'd love to

374
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,000
you know talk about that uh to the

375
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,600
extent that's an area of interest

376
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,519
you know having the opportunity to sit

377
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,959
down with your more traditional

378
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,079
insurance buying colleague whether

379
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,959
that's a risk manager

380
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,920
or a cfo and say hey i'd really like to

381
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,560
understand

382
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,120
um where we're headed in the cyber risk

383
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,040
space

384
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,880
because i that can help me align my

385
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,079
security investment priorities

386
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,519
one of the great disjunctions i think in

387
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,000
cyber insurance market in the cyber

388
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,000
security

389
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,519
market is that they are on this

390
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,120
different buy cycles with fairly

391
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,800
entrenched processes

392
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,519
um when really cyber risk is one

393
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,760
very complex constantly changing risk it

394
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,079
is one risk and it should be united into

395
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,920
uh

396
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,439
at least one analysis if not one

397
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,719
transaction um

398
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,440
so you know uh tim talked about and like

399
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,680
both

400
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,600
the complexity and policy wordings and

401
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,519
unlike other policy forms and other

402
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,760
lines of insurance that have had

403
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,800
decades if not hundreds of years and in

404
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,839
certain

405
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,040
instances to resolve uh around a

406
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,560
standard form

407
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,240
you're right you're you're both exactly

408
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,040
right the wordings are uh

409
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,000
can be different from company to company

410
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,480
perhaps

411
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,600
for no good reason than to make it sound

412
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,760
uh different from a

413
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,560
brand point of view you know and that's

414
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,600
that's something you're going to want to

415
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,920
wrestle with with

416
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,959
a broker to help you translate that and

417
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,240
then that that

418
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,160
the retention conversation really

419
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,839
interests me again because you as

420
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,120
security professionals

421
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:51,760
are in the best position

422
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,560
to quantify so much of the potential

423
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,560
risk

424
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,000
uh along with other colleagues of course

425
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,319
for maybe things like elite

426
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,440
legal liability but for the what what an

427
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,279
insurance person would call

428
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,880
first party risk the costs to

429
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,000
investigate your computer systems if

430
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,079
something happens

431
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,279
the costs to restore from your backups

432
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,959
or uh recover corrupted data

433
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,279
the cost of a business interruption or a

434
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,959
hardware failure and replacement

435
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,880
you know those are all things that i

436
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,359
would say someone like a tim

437
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,560
or a mike knows better than anybody else

438
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,560
in their organization

439
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,199
and so for underwriters of cyber

440
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,359
insurance risk

441
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,240
it was it was cyber was so successful

442
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,160
for so long

443
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,600
that it was easy for everyone to be

444
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,639
happy everyone to walk home happy

445
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,040
without having

446
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,920
quantified so much of this or answer the

447
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,519
question of

448
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,199
what do we want to self-insure what do

449
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,880
we want to have under our retention as

450
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,279
tim is described or our deductible

451
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,720
and what do we really want to shift over

452
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,759
so there are companies that say we're

453
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,360
not as mature

454
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,440
and we want that retention as low as

455
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,360
possible because we're really excited

456
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,199
about the proactive services that

457
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,959
companies insurance companies can bring

458
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,599
to bear and that's something we try to

459
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,800
do well

460
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,480
and we don't always do well and one

461
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,920
thing that mike's helping us uh do

462
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,000
better at our company

463
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,759
um but that's that's a bar that you know

464
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,880
and a knob that you can change as you

465
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,680
think through your insurance

466
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,639
relationship

467
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,839
and really historically the insurance

468
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,680
industry hasn't done a great job of

469
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,839
having these conversations with security

470
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,920
professionals like yourself

471
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,680
that's what's super interesting to me

472
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,800
especially coming here i learned

473
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,560
a bunch of things about insurance cyber

474
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,040
insurance i never knew

475
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,000
and that the you might have heard in the

476
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,000
news that some

477
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,920
companies are actually getting out of

478
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,959
doing cyber insurance

479
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,479
mainly because they're getting hammered

480
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,479
with claims right now and they're

481
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,360
stacking up the losses

482
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,240
from policies they wrote like a year ago

483
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,279
or longer and just simply renewed

484
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,320
and the the problem that that really

485
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:51,600
is uh besetting them right now

486
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:54,720
is um they've got this huge backlog of

487
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:58,000
really what amounts to somewhat

488
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,800
unexamined risk right they they were

489
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,240
like michael

490
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:06,559
like you said was they they they were so

491
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,880
convived to compete with one another

492
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,639
they just went into it with a blindfold

493
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,520
and a dart in hand and threw it at the

494
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,079
wall

495
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,639
in some some cases maybe that's unfair

496
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,159
but

497
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:21,120
but still it really wasn't a very good

498
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,400
look right they didn't i and i i don't

499
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,839
know about you tim but

500
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,079
i've experienced this before where um

501
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,280
you know larger companies end up with a

502
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,240
primary insurer

503
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,678
and then they form a stack of insurance

504
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,919
like other insurance

505
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,960
companies pile on so that you can get

506
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,080
your total

507
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,559
limit like larger for for your company

508
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,199
the car

509
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,399
coverage is bigger but i've been in

510
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,080
these meetings where

511
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,880
they don't ask me about things that

512
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,600
really are the primary risks to the

513
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,720
business

514
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,240
so i'm at a sas company we're doing

515
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,240
devops

516
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,280
right we're trying to secure this whole

517
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,919
arrangement

518
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,520
um we're on cloud you know in the

519
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,320
process of doing it we're using

520
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,840
um you know kubernetes containers we're

521
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,840
doing all this stuff

522
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,678
and they they don't even ask me what

523
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,959
programming languages we use

524
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:15,360
right and so they have no idea

525
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,559
you know none really what the primary

526
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,320
risks are

527
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:22,639
um and and it really stunned me

528
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,600
and and so you know we're trying to

529
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,880
bring it

530
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,280
back to a place where it's examined and

531
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,360
and i and i think the other issue that

532
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,320
comes in here is

533
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,639
when a company insures for fire fire's

534
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,399
been

535
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:41,440
fire since time and memoriam right

536
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,679
fire is just fire it's not alive

537
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,200
and so um the thing that we have in

538
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,200
information security that

539
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,720
it doesn't have to cope with and fire

540
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,559
doesn't have to cope with

541
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,240
is people right like um adversaries

542
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,840
actually inventing new wares

543
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:00,320
and coming at you um and so

544
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,600
it can't depe it can't be like old in

545
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,879
the old insurance model

546
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:07,840
just pure pure i have found that

547
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,360
mike i have found you know having set

548
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,520
annually with

549
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,678
both our primary carrier and then our

550
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:18,639
underwriters that form this

551
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,640
this tower i have noticed

552
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,799
a increasing maturity and awareness

553
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,799
with some of the you know the

554
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,360
questioners you know so over time like

555
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,520
anything

556
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,520
you know in the beginning it was do you

557
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,039
have a firewall

558
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:37,760
well yeah okay check you know

559
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,799
now now it's really a lot more examining

560
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,919
the the program

561
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,799
and the structure and what frameworks do

562
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,120
you

563
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,400
you know do you use and and i'm seeing a

564
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,360
lot more

565
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,000
uh questions programmatic questions so

566
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,080
no then

567
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,160
they may not be asking but you know

568
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,320
about what what programming

569
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,480
language i use but they're asking the

570
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,280
kind of questions that regardless of the

571
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,080
programming

572
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,240
language do you have a training program

573
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,039
for your software developers

574
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,640
for your sys admins different than the

575
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,760
ones for your users

576
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,520
you know so are you are you taking into

577
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,640
account the roles

578
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:19,039
that the people in your organization are

579
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,200
and are you training them to those roles

580
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,879
which is you know a really good good

581
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,799
question because

582
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,440
you know if you know i can remember a

583
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,320
time where everybody had user awareness

584
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,200
training

585
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,840
and again it was a it was a check box

586
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,520
you know

587
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,000
regulators say you have to do it you do

588
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,240
it but the the people that were at the

589
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,640
higher risk of the scale the developers

590
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,640
and programmers and sys admins

591
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,559
you know they didn't have anything

592
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,880
special now they do right and

593
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,600
and so i'm seeing i am seeing a little

594
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,000
bit

595
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,760
i say a little bit probably a dramatic

596
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,960
shift at least in the people that i've

597
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,879
dealt with

598
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,799
which i think is encouraging you know

599
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,400
but i think that's good because we need

600
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,760
cyber insurance we don't need everybody

601
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,679
to go out of business

602
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,240
right off of cyber insurance right i

603
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:07,440
mean it is something that we can ensure

604
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,280
our residual risk with right

605
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,880
insuring against the unknown like are

606
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,678
the unknowable

607
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,080
right threats that are just now starting

608
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,400
to

609
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,000
show their heads or not yet but will

610
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,520
during the course of the term of an

611
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,280
insurance policy

612
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,879
and that that's an important and big

613
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,158
deal right but we

614
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,400
we've also in affleck we created a

615
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,760
and we actually have a separate company

616
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,120
uh

617
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:36,400
infosec services that we offer

618
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:39,678
uh a mssp type model

619
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:42,640
to our independent insurance agents

620
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,440
uh and and we'll probably at some time

621
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,080
expand

622
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,120
this to uh to people that are already

623
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,439
our customers

624
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,360
most of our the vast majority of our

625
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,679
customers are small businesses

626
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,080
and what we found out you know relative

627
00:21:53,679 --> 00:22:00,159
to this conversation was

628
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:03,039
you know for a small business uh

629
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,240
most cyber insurance is not affordable

630
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,120
uh

631
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,600
it's just not so we have partnered with

632
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,719
some

633
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,158
that's created a product geared towards

634
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,159
small business

635
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,320
and you know our research and our

636
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,640
statistics showed that

637
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,439
four small businesses that had a cyber

638
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,080
attack

639
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,799
60 of those small businesses just went

640
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,120
away

641
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,559
they disappeared they couldn't absorb it

642
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,840
and so we

643
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:31,600
yeah so we're not the underwriter or the

644
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,039
provider we're partnering i mean we're

645
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,000
not a pnc

646
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:38,879
company anyway right uh but so we're

647
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
partnering with a an actual provider to

648
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,280
provide this

649
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,080
lower scale of affordable

650
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,559
you know eight dollars a month covers

651
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,879
you know

652
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,320
typically a hundred thousand dollar uh

653
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,559
package of insurance

654
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,080
which i i really think the small

655
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:57,120
business was the underserved

656
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,639
is the underserved uh because

657
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,719
you know most of them are forced to

658
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,120
self-insure because they couldn't afford

659
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,280
it

660
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,559
and again if they have a claim there and

661
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,639
they're you know

662
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:08,158
especially if they're a

663
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,919
technology-dependent small business uh

664
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,480
they're in a lot of trouble

665
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,000
you know um those are both so there's

666
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,080
two things i'd like to touch on really

667
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,320
quickly one is the underwriting process

668
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,280
for the large companies and then the

669
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,080
second is

670
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,600
what you've i agree with you 100 is the

671
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,559
need for cyber insurance for smaller

672
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,199
companies

673
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,799
and so i i with respect to larger risks

674
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,559
and the underwriting process there

675
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:33,120
you know tim and mike have both been you

676
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:35,600
know csos at extraordinary companies

677
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,039
you know underwriters at insurance

678
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,080
companies like the ones i've worked for

679
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,679
or advised

680
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,600
they say well we don't want to be the

681
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,360
most invasive person on in the line you

682
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,120
know they're very concerned about

683
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,559
asking too many questions so you know

684
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,840
i'd love to hear about your experience

685
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,799
there and then just

686
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,918
um maybe maybe underwriters are under a

687
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,080
false impression that

688
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,600
if they did bring more rigor to it that

689
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,080
that wouldn't be a commercial detriment

690
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,439
to them

691
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,199
uh and then on the small side of the

692
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,720
market you know i think that's a

693
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,120
fascinating problem and another one

694
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,120
where

695
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,879
security professionals can make such a

696
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,320
difference because there there aren't

697
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,320
enough human underwriters

698
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,080
who are expert to go around to even

699
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,480
assess small companies meaningfully

700
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,439
it becomes much more about the risk

701
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,440
analysis

702
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,559
and the cyber security expertise and

703
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,440
then trying to scale that through

704
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,678
technology

705
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,120
to find that right fit on price and of

706
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,200
course on on on

707
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,080
risk capital on the other side so i mean

708
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,880
i think these are both really

709
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,080
interesting things

710
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,000
love to hear what you have to think

711
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,279
about and the big

712
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,279
end i i agree with tim i'm they're

713
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,919
starting to ask the right questions both

714
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,039
on the

715
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:39,600
application for insurance form and also

716
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,640
and and this is true of large companies

717
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,279
there's always

718
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,480
an interview with a bunch of technical

719
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,760
experts

720
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,080
um or more or less experts

721
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,200
from the from the companies in the stack

722
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,000
right so

723
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,279
i've been on calls with 16 people firing

724
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,080
questions at me

725
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,960
for a few hours right so it's it's it's

726
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,199
an interesting

727
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,240
it's an interesting arrangement but like

728
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,240
asking questions

729
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,720
is not the best way to do it because

730
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,200
depending on how you phrase the question

731
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,440
like whether intentional or not you know

732
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,840
as a cso you're going to answer

733
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,480
at to the level of your understanding of

734
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,240
the question

735
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,840
and the level of the precision of the

736
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,520
question right

737
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,760
because it's like being on a wooden

738
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:25,039
stand so you're not gonna

739
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,720
you're not gonna offer extra things like

740
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,640
it's exactly like being on the witness

741
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,919
stand same thing with the questions on

742
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,960
the forum

743
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,840
so usually it's better to

744
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,520
sense either externally or to be

745
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,879
permitted to

746
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:44,400
basically get a connector to say

747
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:47,679
office 365 or or whatever it is

748
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,520
that you use azure just just to get

749
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,960
an idea of what the settings are and

750
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,639
then you have to have a technical team

751
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,760
that would analyze that right and

752
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:59,039
see how how well it's run

753
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:02,480
because in the end information security

754
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:05,120
is another it enterprise another i.t

755
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,880
vertical a lot of different ways and

756
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:11,199
just like the old itil

757
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:13,919
arrangement of the evaluating

758
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,400
it system goes essentially in some it's

759
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,520
people

760
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,919
process and technology

761
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,679
you know those things matter and having

762
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,480
those things in equal measure

763
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,200
and balancing those things out really is

764
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,279
should be

765
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,279
a primary subject of underwriting

766
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:31,760
technical underwriting activity

767
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,360
right so to see whether or not you've

768
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,679
you you can stack and

769
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,360
you notice him yeah i have i have

770
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,799
firewalls they're in a closet over there

771
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,279
because i don't have any people to run

772
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,039
them

773
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,200
and i don't have a process to run them

774
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,039
and buy i mean that was tj maxx right

775
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,720
they literally didn't have them

776
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,799
they did have them but they were not

777
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,159
deployed and so

778
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,080
and then all these credit cards got

779
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,080
taken right so

780
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,520
so that's part of it but again going

781
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,080
back to

782
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,240
it's not just about the team the people

783
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,918
part it's it's not just about the team

784
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,360
that you have on your information

785
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,400
security

786
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,320
be you know at your company or

787
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,559
even the attitude about you know of your

788
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,600
company about information security or

789
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,559
your c-suites

790
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:17,279
willingness to fund it it's also there's

791
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:19,520
another group of people that get a vote

792
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,039
in this particular it enterprise and

793
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,720
that's the advocacy

794
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:26,640
right the threat and so um

795
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,559
it needs to be taken into account so in

796
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,880
my view that's what underwriting i've

797
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,000
encompassed right it should evaluate

798
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,880
those things

799
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,320
um directly and it it should reduce it

800
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,039
should be done in a way that reduces the

801
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,840
burden

802
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:41,440
on companies right um we're going to

803
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,799
scan you from outside

804
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,039
we're going to you know have a

805
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:48,080
connection kind of like

806
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:49,679
um i forget what company it was

807
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,399
insurance company was it would give you

808
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:55,679
a little dongle uh to plug in your

809
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:58,639
in your car right the odb2 connector

810
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,279
and uh it was your your safe driving and

811
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,600
you know

812
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,039
incentive basically if you behaved while

813
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,320
you drop drove

814
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:09,840
and it could measure uh from that then

815
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:12,320
you'd get a better read right yeah

816
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,879
i i do think there's indicators though

817
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,879
you know if

818
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,200
and and i i kind of go back to my

819
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,559
military career and one of my

820
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,080
assignments

821
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:25,600
uh i i happen to do a lot of uh

822
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,760
you know i was at a headquarters so i

823
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,760
would augment the ig inspections i would

824
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,320
do staff assistance visits

825
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,879
and i could generally go into a unit and

826
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,200
based just on the primary indicators

827
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,440
i could kind of figure out after a while

828
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,000
what the units were going to

829
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,880
and i do think the insurance industry

830
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,360
can really help out in this space

831
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:50,159
you know about starting to create some

832
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,639
reasonable benchmarks of what they see

833
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,480
and i think you know and our our major

834
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,120
broker in this has been a very good

835
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,039
partner

836
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:01,120
in doing that because um

837
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,480
you know if i go into if i go into a

838
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,320
company and and

839
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:09,520
i see a highly technical

840
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:11,918
security program but i don't see

841
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,760
kind of the risk management discipline

842
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,159
overlaying that

843
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,360
uh it makes me very uncomfortable you

844
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,120
know it's almost like oh

845
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,199
i've got some really smart techies but

846
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,678
they're not really understanding the

847
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,240
threat

848
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,200
the the and and the mitigation and the

849
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,200
controls and

850
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,240
those kind of those structural kinds of

851
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,360
things

852
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:34,320
and and i think you know when when i

853
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,799
i know when you know again talking to

854
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,879
you know

855
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:39,440
the the different carriers that that we

856
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,080
deal with

857
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,320
you can tell the difference between how

858
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,120
they ask the question and what they

859
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,720
typically see and i do agree with it's

860
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:52,239
about like a deposition

861
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,880
this much easier but you know i mean

862
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,120
they're not exactly adversarial like

863
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,360
plaintiff's attorney but anyway

864
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,199
but but it is i mean it's a it's a long

865
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,158
question but you can start getting a

866
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,159
sense of

867
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,520
this guy's been at it a while he knows

868
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,919
what to ask he knows what's

869
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,600
looking for he's he's kind of got this

870
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,799
kind of picture in his mind what you

871
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,399
expect to see

872
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,320
and then if you don't exceed what you

873
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,959
expect to see you know to dig deeper

874
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,720
right

875
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,559
if you kind of see what you expect to

876
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,120
see then you you kind of go

877
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,000
and and i do think uh you know that's

878
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,959
very helpful

879
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,240
i would love to see the industry start

880
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,960
creating

881
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,320
benchmarks you know for instance based

882
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,919
on the size of the company

883
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:36,000
and and what they do right

884
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,600
uh you should expect to see about the

885
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,720
same size team

886
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,360
with about the same size skills or the

887
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,720
same

888
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,719
skills and about the same spin

889
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,320
right and you could start creating kind

890
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,679
of a tier that says

891
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:54,720
very quickly you know this company's

892
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:57,279
really good at it or

893
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,159
they're not that measure of

894
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:01,440
reasonableness

895
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:04,159
but there are index you know maturity

896
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,080
evaluation indexes they touch on all the

897
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,960
things that you just mentioned

898
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,120
um i don't i don't know why um that

899
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,279
really hasn't come to the fore

900
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,959
um i think automation helps like a

901
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,799
reduce the load like i said but

902
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,240
you're right you can smell it when

903
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,639
you're going it's like

904
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,159
being a ciso after you've been asleep so

905
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,279
a bunch of times and coming to a new

906
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,880
company

907
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,399
i mean you could you can tell when you

908
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,559
hit the ground

909
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:32,559
maybe 48 hours after the view right yeah

910
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:35,200
what's going on and then yeah you're

911
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:37,678
right um pulling on those threads

912
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,679
um of things that aren't quite right is

913
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,799
is something that that we

914
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,559
we definitely have seen

915
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,480
before but you can also tell whether or

916
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,519
not the company itself that's ensuring

917
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,440
use

918
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,559
what their level of sophistication is

919
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,519
too

920
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:54,639
yeah um and you can tell when it's not

921
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:58,399
and what it is

922
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:01,120
for sure um and uh you know in my

923
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,600
experience it's it's when it comes like

924
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,120
i

925
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:07,120
said earlier when a cyber insurance

926
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,479
technical rep is asking you a bunch of

927
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,518
questions

928
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,679
and you find that you know they're not

929
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,440
even asking you about the crown jewels

930
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,519
of your company

931
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,799
if you're at twitter it's an advertising

932
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,399
company if they're not

933
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:23,600
asking you about the developers that

934
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:26,559
touch the advertising engine

935
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,600
they probably don't understand like

936
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:30,639
where they

937
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,240
where the big loss could come from um or

938
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,000
anything about what they're insuring

939
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,440
right yeah the technical price and

940
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,840
enterprise they're ensuring what do you

941
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,320
think of that

942
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,080
yeah i think michael you know if we if

943
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,080
we have time i think it'd be interesting

944
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,120
to get your perspective on claims that

945
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,960
you're seeing

946
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,120
that's something every year that's very

947
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,240
helpful to to me to kind of

948
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,360
you know augment our risk so yeah please

949
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,720
uh so um

950
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,678
thank you and i realized that you gave

951
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,760
me an opening to to push back against

952
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,159
fears that cyber insurance doesn't cover

953
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,158
anything

954
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,919
well so there have been a number of high

955
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,720
high

956
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,679
high profile not petya attacks that have

957
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,919
triggered insurance

958
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,600
disputes but what i'm pleased to say as

959
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,399
a cyber insurance lawyer is that the

960
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,639
products

961
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,840
that we refer to as cyber insurance they

962
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,440
paid those claims so

963
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,720
not yet wannacry um all of the advanced

964
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,039
persistent threat

965
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,640
vectors that you could name today the

966
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,600
cyber insurance market historically has

967
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,600
paid the claims

968
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,678
whereas as mike was describing those

969
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,760
silent cyber

970
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,039
insurance lines they didn't really quite

971
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,600
realize they were doing that that's

972
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,760
where those disputes came in

973
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,799
but i do think that being sensitive to

974
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,399
the the war

975
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,320
war exclusion language and the cyber

976
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:46,559
terrorism language is a very thoughtful

977
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,678
thing for cyber security professionals

978
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,158
like yourselves as leaders of

979
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:52,320
organizations to be tracking

980
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,600
brokers do a great job you know some of

981
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,918
the major brokers have done a great job

982
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,600
of

983
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,919
essentially imposing their will on

984
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,959
behalf of uh their clients as to how it

985
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,000
should be structured

986
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:05,200
um so i don't think that is a

987
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,399
today thing to fear in fact but as we

988
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,520
look at the the

989
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:11,839
geopolitics of the world and the rising

990
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,359
the rising sophistication of cyber crime

991
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:16,560
some of these are going to

992
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:19,040
abut what is a increasingly

993
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,359
underdeveloped legal understanding of

994
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,800
what is cyber warfare versus cyber crime

995
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,839
versus cyber terrorism so i do think

996
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,520
that's very thoughtful

997
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,199
although uh you know if you gave me one

998
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,639
of those i i think you wouldn't have a

999
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:30,719
problem is my hint

1000
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,240
uh although you know all caveats as a

1001
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,520
lawyer you know so

1002
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,439
what what are we seeing from an

1003
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,800
insurance perspective uh there are

1004
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,520
really two major

1005
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,359
claims trends that cyber insurers are

1006
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,918
routinely paying the claims on the first

1007
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,399
is

1008
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,759
is the ransomware epidemic um so most

1009
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,839
cyber insurance

1010
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,159
policies now have what is called

1011
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:52,000
dedicated cyber extortion coverage

1012
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,760
so that may be an endorsement and maybe

1013
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,879
an insuring agreement in the main

1014
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,280
form but it's there and it covers all

1015
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,000
laws associated with investigating and

1016
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,160
resolving

1017
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,359
an extortion threat and so the insurance

1018
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,279
market refers to

1019
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,640
ransomware as an extortion threat

1020
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,240
although a lot of the damage has already

1021
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,598
been done the moment uh the encryption

1022
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,959
has happened of course

1023
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,320
um when i first started advising

1024
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,040
insurance companies

1025
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,760
uh when we wrote that that form we were

1026
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,320
thinking about

1027
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,280
threatened ddos attacks you know uh

1028
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,560
american

1029
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,400
uh vandals and and uh you know maybe

1030
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,720
occasionally a sophisticated cyber

1031
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,880
criminal writing a letter to a bank in

1032
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,480
in uh magazine cut out letters saying

1033
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,839
you know i'm going to ddos your your

1034
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,920
website if you don't

1035
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,599
you know leave a briefcase full of money

1036
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,640
anonymous right with the

1037
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,520
orbit ion cannon exactly you're exactly

1038
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,000
right and then

1039
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,800
there then it started to productize you

1040
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,680
know

1041
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,960
sophisticated software engineers who are

1042
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,560
criminals by night

1043
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,320
developing ransomware and that became

1044
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,599
the easiest way to part an innocent

1045
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,880
victim from their money

1046
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:58,800
the demands have gone stratospheric over

1047
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,240
the last uh two years and in particular

1048
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,920
the last few months actually

1049
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,680
so when i first started handling those

1050
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,200
claims and paying those claims

1051
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:08,960
uh the the scale of the encryption was

1052
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,399
small and the demands were small it was

1053
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,599
very easy just to pay

1054
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,359
500 a thousand dollars now so

1055
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:16,960
the unfortunately the curve is

1056
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:19,359
uninterrupted so i won't

1057
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,359
belabor it now it is not uncommon to see

1058
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:24,640
seven and eight figure ransom demands

1059
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:25,119
with uh your backups also encrypted them

1060
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,839
knowing

1061
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:29,119
that they have you dead to rights and

1062
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,759
they also threaten

1063
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,040
to uh publish the information or leak

1064
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,079
the information or send it to your

1065
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,160
competitors

1066
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,119
um and so that makes it a much more

1067
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,839
devastating

1068
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,240
uh trend that i flagged for everyone uh

1069
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,920
and i

1070
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,680
i'll put a pin in this for you guys to

1071
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,280
speak about but the main

1072
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,359
threat vectors through which this

1073
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,560
happens how does a ransomware happen and

1074
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,400
how does it get prevented

1075
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,839
um i could give you my view as a claims

1076
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,240
lawyer but i'd rather defer

1077
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:55,359
and then the second problem is business

1078
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,520
email compromises

1079
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,720
uh and of course most of that comes from

1080
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,960
user error and

1081
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,160
phishing and and uh and the like and

1082
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,240
unfortunately

1083
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,839
folks like you are also dealing with an

1084
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,560
increasingly complex legal

1085
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:09,599
overlay over all of this so how much

1086
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,560
data privacy

1087
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,680
uh investigation do you need to do how

1088
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,680
often do you need to

1089
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,440
uh you know resort to lawyering to

1090
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,359
figure out do i need to write letters to

1091
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,000
attorneys general or to impacted

1092
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:23,040
customers

1093
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,440
or clients or employees and so those two

1094
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,560
those two trends really drive uh drive

1095
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,720
my day-to-day

1096
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,799
although of course there's the gdpr and

1097
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,799
other legal problems and then there's

1098
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,880
you know system failure is now an area

1099
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,520
where uh cyber insurance market wants to

1100
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,079
address it

1101
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,680
so no security event at all just our

1102
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,359
comp we rely on computer systems to

1103
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,759
operate and they do not function

1104
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:45,359
now we can't uh you know make a dollar

1105
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,079
you know we also want to address that

1106
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,119
problem

1107
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:51,200
and that's fairly new to the market um

1108
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,880
last few years so the claims experience

1109
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,720
in that area is not as deep but i'm

1110
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,640
happy to talk about that too

1111
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,000
yeah well let's talk about one thing

1112
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,799
like

1113
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,440
just yesterday or maybe the day before

1114
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,520
um

1115
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,720
where the u.s came out with some

1116
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,320
admonitions about

1117
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:10,000
paying ransoms um and saying you know

1118
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,079
certain ones are excluded

1119
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,560
certainly if they're a prohibited person

1120
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,720
like banned person you can't do it

1121
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,000
which which presents certain problems

1122
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,000
because they're

1123
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,920
you know there's some eastern european

1124
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,280
you know entities that are banned

1125
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,839
um separating the criminal from a

1126
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,520
government

1127
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:32,480
as as iffy in certain places

1128
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:34,000
and uh so if they're banned people or

1129
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,720
organizations

1130
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,520
uh we just gotta fire you know shot over

1131
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,279
the bow from

1132
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,200
the us government telling us you can't

1133
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,560
pay them so what's your what's your

1134
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,520
thoughts on that mike i mean

1135
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,359
it's uh i mean you too tim like what do

1136
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:51,599
you think

1137
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:52,640
well from a from a pragmatic standpoint

1138
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,720
i can kind of

1139
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,720
talk through the experience i've had you

1140
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,439
know our one of our

1141
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,560
probably our major insurance arm is in

1142
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,240
japan

1143
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,480
and they have some very specific

1144
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,720
legislation in japan

1145
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,920
and again i may not be using the right

1146
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,319
term but anyway

1147
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,680
their regulatory environment their their

1148
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,920
legal environment

1149
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,960
is very prohibitive or has been for a

1150
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,760
long time

1151
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,320
of ever paying money to a criminal so

1152
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,599
whether it's

1153
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:23,680
extortion or whatever so you know

1154
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,880
in our corporate program in a corporate

1155
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,839
policy on this

1156
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,000
you know we had to be very sensitive to

1157
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:30,240
that

1158
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,920
and and then you know like most

1159
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,040
companies you know our policy is we're

1160
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,079
not going to pay

1161
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,119
right we you know we've crafted some

1162
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:39,200
exits

1163
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,280
you know that would say you know it

1164
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:44,160
gives a you know our board

1165
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,359
reasonable flexibility but at the same

1166
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,118
time you know it's the

1167
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,480
it's what you just pointed out mike you

1168
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,440
know there's elements that you're just

1169
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,560
not going to pay

1170
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,880
right and and

1171
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,560
you know it's it's interesting that you

1172
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,359
know what what michael was saying

1173
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,000
earlier

1174
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,720
about paying a lot more ransom claims uh

1175
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,040
most of the

1176
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:08,078
ransom the ransom amounts that i've seen

1177
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,960
by and large uh have been well under our

1178
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,119
retention

1179
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,400
we would never file a claim against our

1180
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,680
carrier because it was

1181
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:18,880
well within our retention but you know

1182
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:21,680
we have gotten some ransom notes uh

1183
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,920
that alluding to the fact of you know

1184
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,680
and

1185
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,160
and you know these are almost comical to

1186
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,480
read

1187
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,759
and i'm sure y'all have read them but

1188
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,760
alluding to the fact

1189
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,920
it wouldn't hurt you anyway because your

1190
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:38,400
insurance will cover it kind of thing

1191
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:41,920
hey insurance is fueling this problem

1192
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,599
right because they're paying yeah super

1193
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:46,400
i mean it's super interesting and of

1194
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:48,960
course they're paying cryptocurrency

1195
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,760
some cryptocurrency exchanges are

1196
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,160
actually

1197
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,760
you know registered and responsive to

1198
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,000
law enforcement

1199
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,280
um but some are out of the reach and of

1200
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,480
course those are the ones that

1201
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:02,480
um criminals and extra judicial you know

1202
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,720
extra jurisdictional

1203
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,720
criminals are are using right the ones

1204
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:09,680
out of each of those

1205
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,279
um i mean my retort to the uh the

1206
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,879
government's uh edict

1207
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,560
yesterday about thou shall not babies

1208
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,680
prohibited people is

1209
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,000
they're making their demands for you for

1210
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,598
us

1211
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,920
to pay to prohibited exchanges basically

1212
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,400
the

1213
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,599
extra jurisdictional um and

1214
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,280
non-responsive

1215
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:33,680
exchanges bring to bear the power

1216
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,400
of the department of treasury um the fcc

1217
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,200
um

1218
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,599
and a bunch of others to force telecoms

1219
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,439
to

1220
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:42,560
shunt the you know make it impossible to

1221
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,920
reach

1222
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,279
those entities right so i i i oh

1223
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,200
you're off on a whole different

1224
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,359
discussion i'd love to have but

1225
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,319
i i like to have about the carriers but

1226
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:57,040
anyway

1227
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:57,040
yeah yeah um yeah we could go on

1228
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,880
well so i there's just a couple of quick

1229
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,680
things that i'll highlight and

1230
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:06,480
happy to take direction after that uh

1231
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,560
one is that cyber insurance today

1232
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,160
is studiously neutral on the decision

1233
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,319
itself

1234
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,078
as to whether to pay the ransom so the

1235
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:15,520
coverage does not say you will pay the

1236
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:16,480
ransom when the insurance company tells

1237
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,200
you to

1238
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,880
it does you are making a claim on it to

1239
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,879
reimburse you for that decision

1240
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,160
and then if you are on the road to

1241
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,000
making that decision

1242
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,160
there is a claims process around that

1243
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,760
and there are experts that we prefer

1244
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,920
who are capable of helping you through

1245
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,440
that process but you know it is a

1246
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,440
the question of whether it should be

1247
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,560
legal to pay or not the question of when

1248
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,839
to pay or not to pay

1249
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,160
you know i was very heartened to hear

1250
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:42,319
tim's companies you know thought through

1251
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,520
uh you know how they might contemplate

1252
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,480
that decision if there was something

1253
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,560
catastrophic

1254
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,599
you know that's so important and then i

1255
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,240
do think there are these really

1256
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,880
interesting

1257
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,479
uh anecdotes from around the world uh

1258
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,960
tim raised the japanese example

1259
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,800
in my prior firm i was uh you know i had

1260
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,480
global claims responsibilities and

1261
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,839
you know our japanese cyber underwriters

1262
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,040
would say well i don't even have to sell

1263
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,960
this because

1264
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,359
there is no ransomware in japan and of

1265
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,800
course that sounds beautiful right

1266
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:08,480
but you know we had a we had under you

1267
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,760
know we had a team in italy who have

1268
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,160
who had a similar legal regime and

1269
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,880
didn't have that problem so uh in the

1270
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,319
corner of does a legal prohibition work

1271
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,000
i would highlight those things

1272
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,680
in the in the contrary you know and

1273
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,359
again just to sort of drive discussion

1274
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,359
as we all think about these things

1275
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,799
so there's the legacy of kidnapping

1276
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:27,680
ransom insurance

1277
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,040
so you know that is another area of uh

1278
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,839
successful insurance

1279
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,319
um that also has helped to bend the

1280
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:35,920
curve

1281
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:38,640
of what was a ra rampant

1282
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,920
uh ransom kidnapped four ransom industry

1283
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,359
there's a number of uh interesting

1284
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,920
academic articles in the last couple of

1285
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:43,839
years

1286
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,960
trying to describe that underwriters

1287
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:46,880
with expertise in

1288
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,720
what are the likelihoods of something

1289
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,520
happening as well as security

1290
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,078
professionals

1291
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:54,480
who know how to remedy such a problem in

1292
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,800
that context the human uh ransom

1293
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,720
context uh have been able to reduce the

1294
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,200
frequency reduce the severity

1295
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,919
and also protect victims who do fall to

1296
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,759
it you know so

1297
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,119
that way when you're in the moment there

1298
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,880
is insurance there for you

1299
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:08,319
so the question comes here you know or

1300
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:12,240
where i'm teeing it up for everyone

1301
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:13,520
is um can cyber insurance with

1302
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,279
appropriate levels of underwriting

1303
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,640
expertise and security expertise

1304
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,839
get to a place where yes if it is a

1305
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,640
last resort that you you know have

1306
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:24,000
thoughtfully evaluated

1307
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,680
you must do it there is insurance

1308
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,440
available for it but

1309
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,960
we have we are going to bring to bear

1310
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,240
this expertise to prevent it from

1311
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,319
happening in the first place

1312
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,000
and then to improve the ecosystem

1313
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:35,279
because both of you are correct

1314
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,880
i uh you know i've been talking with

1315
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,640
some of our reinsurance partners and

1316
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,760
it's over a billion dollars well over a

1317
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,078
billion dollars

1318
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,960
in insurance money has gone through this

1319
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,440
ecosystem

1320
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,760
right right to the these dark web

1321
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,319
startups that are software companies

1322
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,200
um and and so changing that dynamic how

1323
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:54,000
can you do that

1324
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,759
but also protect victims of this crime

1325
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,520
you know is a really fascinating uh

1326
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,359
and thorny wicket to me and we have a

1327
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,920
question here too from one of the

1328
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:02,560
one one of our viewers saying you know

1329
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,720
hey

1330
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,599
there are proposed regulations out there

1331
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,319
that are

1332
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:10,079
talking about uh facilitate making it

1333
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:11,040
illegal to facilitate a ransomware

1334
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,680
payment

1335
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,359
um and of course the question is where

1336
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,799
does it put insurance companies and i

1337
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:18,319
think the answer to that is we have to

1338
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,119
figure that out yet

1339
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:22,160
right or if you know it maybe it may be

1340
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,800
impossible to

1341
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,359
to do that anymore i i don't know if

1342
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,000
that's

1343
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:28,480
if that's actually approved right yeah

1344
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,119
so

1345
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,599
yeah so i see r i see uh mr anderson's

1346
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,440
question

1347
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,280
and i uh you know which is isn't the

1348
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,800
decision to rants on ransom based on

1349
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,480
whether the cost of repair

1350
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,000
is vastly greater than the ransom cost

1351
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,119
and you're exactly right rational

1352
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,359
economics would say

1353
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,200
well hell if i could fix this for less i

1354
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:48,240
would and in my experience

1355
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:50,799
uh of the claims that i've uh handled

1356
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,479
um first of all four out of five ransom

1357
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,400
claims that's sort of my rule of thumb

1358
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,720
end up getting negotiated in the ransom

1359
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,800
paid but that's because

1360
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,078
four out of five or in a situation well

1361
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,280
slightly greater than four out of five

1362
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,440
are in a situation

1363
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,400
where they don't have another avenue of

1364
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,319
recovery

1365
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,920
right so what becomes really interesting

1366
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:08,720
and complex are those avenues of

1367
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,480
recovery

1368
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,319
and pricing that against the ransom

1369
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,920
sometimes the bad guys have it

1370
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:16,000
pretty dead on so there's been a number

1371
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,760
of big ransom uh events i've been on

1372
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,720
with large organizations

1373
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:23,520
where i worked with csos and some of our

1374
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:25,919
uh expert partners to price out

1375
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,839
data recovery we're gonna we're gonna

1376
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,839
recover your data here we're going to

1377
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:31,440
back restore backups here we're going to

1378
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:34,240
replace systems here

1379
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,960
and when we tallied that bill uh the

1380
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,520
delta

1381
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,640
was meaningless to the insurance company

1382
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,720
and then it became a time

1383
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,640
question how fast would it take to

1384
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,520
decrypt all of your systems

1385
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,759
if we negotiated this first could you

1386
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,560
stand the business loss of that period

1387
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,560
of time

1388
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,640
yeah right can you can you can you

1389
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:55,119
support it right like can you bear it

1390
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,040
and and the answer and that's a cost

1391
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:58,880
right business interruption cost

1392
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,240
essentially that has to be dealt with

1393
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:03,839
too so

1394
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:06,959
anyway i think we're a bit over time um

1395
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:08,160
but we're at the end okay

1396
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,640
this has been a great a great

1397
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:13,040
conversation i think the audience has uh

1398
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,000
has stuck around we've got a uh you know

1399
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,720
40 people

1400
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,640
on the line paying attention here and

1401
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:21,200
enthralled by this conversation

1402
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:22,319
so um i i want to thank you all for

1403
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,640
coming on today

1404
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:26,720
it's uh it's it's cyber insurance is

1405
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,879
something that really is a uh

1406
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,078
an important factor you know we we need

1407
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,480
this to do our jobs

1408
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:34,079
but we have to understand how to use it

1409
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,599
uh to our advantage right

1410
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,440
it's it's not something that we can just

1411
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:40,640
rely on to be a silver bullet

1412
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,800
so uh thank thanks again for coming on

1413
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,000
um i'm gonna get our next speaker going

1414

and uh

1415
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,200
