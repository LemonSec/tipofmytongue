00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,320
to join today

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,000
uh and i think it's so amazing that

28
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,720
you're able to bring these this group

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,720
of folks together

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
so i'm here

31
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,600
to talk about our mission as cyber

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
security professionals

33
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,158
and the culture of the environments that

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,560
we find ourselves in

35
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,840
in my roles over the past several years

36
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,600
i've had the pleasure of hosting

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,840
roundtable discussions with cyber

38
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,439
security leaders around the globe

39
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,439
and the most common challenge that i

40
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:57,520
hear about has to do with hiring

41
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,520
and re and retaining great talent

42
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,000
so a couple of years ago i found myself

43
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:06,560
in a very unusual situation

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,520
my boss jacob hansen asked me if i would

45
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,560
like to lead

46
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,480
the people function at cobalt

47
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,000
so the thing is i've worked as a cyber

48
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,879
security practitioner

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,680
for 15 years i'm very passionate about

50
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,440
people

51
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,879
that's why i created the humans of

52
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,040
infosec podcast

53
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,200
but i've never actually worked in human

54
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,200
resources before

55
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,480
so jacob said to me look we're really

56
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,799
onto something here

57
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,879
the company has found product market fit

58
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,160
and our impact on the industry continues

59
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,239
to grow

60
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,359
now the most important thing for us to

61
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,280
do is to focus on our people

62
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,879
in the next few years we will elevate

63
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,120
cobalt's people function to be a

64
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,280
world-class organization

65
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,239
and to do this we must build an

66
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,400
environment

67
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,080
that cultivates personal and

68
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,120
professional performance

69
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,080
growth and happiness in order for cobalt

70
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,920
to be successful

71
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,519
in the near and long term we must

72
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,238
attract acquire

73
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,680
and retain great talent so today i have

74
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,760
the unusual job

75
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,120
where i lead both people and security at

76
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,560
cobalt

77
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,560
when i joined the company three years

78
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,360
ago four years ago now

79
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,200
i was the eighth employee today we're

80
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,440
about 120

81
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,799
members strong and we hope to grow the

82
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,280
team to 150

83
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,080
by the end of this year it has been

84
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,720
super fun

85
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,360
and i'm very excited to see where this

86
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,080
journey takes us next

87
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,440
so that's a little bit about why people

88
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,640
matter at cobalt

89
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,920
today i'm going to talk about why do

90
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,559
people matter

91
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,079
for cyber security i want to share with

92
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,799
you some musings that i have

93
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,000
on what humans can do to solve cyber

94
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,319
cybersecurity problems

95
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,599
and what machines can do to help us out

96
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,518
with that

97
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,959
i want to talk about an outcome of the

98
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,959
skills shortage

99
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,560
and frankly everything we've been

100
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,280
experiencing this year

101
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,280
and burnout and the impact that has on

102
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,400
us as professionals and the work that we

103
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,840
do

104
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,000
i want to share a couple examples of

105
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,519
cognitive behavioral therapy that i

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,879
found personally

107
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,280
to be very helpful and i do have some

108
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,399
action oriented takeaways both for

109
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,758
hiring managers

110
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:24,880
as well as for everyone

111
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,440
so let's go ahead and dive in i want to

112
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,159
start

113
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,840
with why does cyber security matter in

114
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,320
the first place

115
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,280
and it's because the internet was never

116
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,400
intended

117
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,440
to do what it does today

118
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:43,359
in 1969 four university computers

119
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:45,360
at ucla stanford usb ucsb

120
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,120
and the university of utah were

121
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,960
connected via arpanet

122
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,280
a project started by the defense

123
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,799
department's advanced research

124
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,719
projects agency in 1985

125
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,400
the national science foundation

126
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,280
established nsfnet

127
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,880
a network of scientific computers that

128
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,679
serve scientists researchers and

129
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,360
engineers

130
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,280
who worked for the national center for

131
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,360
atmospheric research

132
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,198
these people studied the atmosphere and

133
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,639
its interactions with the oceans

134
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,840
land and sun a decade later the internet

135
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,880
was being used to support

136
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,159
electronic commerce during a 1998 u.s

137
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,840
senate testimonial

138
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,000
a group of security researchers

139
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,960
explained that the internet was

140
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,680
not quote unquote designed for it they

141
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,239
described

142
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,000
the academic and scientific objectives

143
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,600
of getting computers to talk to each

144
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,960
other

145
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,039
from that testimonial quote it grew up

146
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,080
it flourished it struck everybody by

147
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,400
surprise

148
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,919
and now big business is saying well

149
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,198
let's jump on board and make some money

150
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,880
off of this

151
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,639
well this is kind of like if you've

152
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,880
driven in boston

153
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,400
the streets aren't tremendously designed

154
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,240
in a wonderful fashion

155
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,479
because they followed the cows around

156
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,039
and they laid the pavement down

157
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,360
i mean you can get it to work but it can

158
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,880
be really painful

159
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,400
in 2003 the first version of the owasp

160
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,120
top 10 was published

161
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,599
and in 2011 mark hendrickson wrote

162
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,800
software is eating the world

163
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,919
so here we are cyber security is a

164
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,000
problem

165
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,919
because we use the internet for things

166
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,199
that it was never designed to

167
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,080
accommodate

168
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,280
and so many things depend on software

169
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,199
when value shifts

170
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,318
from the physical world to the digital

171
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,160
world

172
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:34,560
protecting that value has to shift too

173
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,000
today we have tremendous demand for

174
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,680
cyber security talent

175
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,680
and simply not enough supply the latest

176
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,400
isc squared cyber security workforce

177
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,240
study

178
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,440
states that the workforce gap has

179
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,639
increased

180
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,800
again primarily due to the global surge

181
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,360
in hiring demand

182
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,120
using the global workforce estimate of

183
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,759
2.8 million

184
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,919
based on the 11 economies for which isc

185
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,240
squared provided a workforce estimate

186
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,560
and the global gap estimate of four of

187
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,400
over four million

188
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,000
they estimate that the global workforce

189
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:13,039
needs to grow by 145 percent

190
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,880
in this particular 2019 study

191
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:19,680
65 percent of organizations represented

192
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,960
have a shortage of staff dedicated to

193
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,840
cyber security

194
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,359
and the lack of skilled and experienced

195
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,119
cyber security personnel

196
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,400
is a top concern among survey

197
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,160
respondents

198
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,679
so it's really no surprise to me that

199
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,199
that when i get together

200
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,960
with folks who are cyber security

201
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,039
leaders and hiring managers

202
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,318
that the number one problem that folks

203
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,759
tell me about

204
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:44,080
is hiring so

205
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,680
the thing is that just like any other

206
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,520
business initiative

207
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,440
a successful cyber security program

208
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,799
needs the right balance

209
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,240
of people process and technology tools

210
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,280
can be useful

211
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,960
but no tool is a silver bullet any type

212
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,919
of cybersecurity technology

213
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,799
still requires people and the right

214
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,479
workflows

215
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:09,039
to be effective i want to talk for just

216
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,120
a moment about why unfortunately

217
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:14,639
all of our cyber security problems can't

218
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:18,000
simply be solved by using technology

219
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,720
the thing is that computers are really

220
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,879
good

221
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,919
at doing exactly what you tell them to

222
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,840
do

223
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,080
they are not so good at thinking

224
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,878
creatively or applying business

225
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,318
logic even the most sophisticated

226
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,479
machine learning techniques

227
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,159
are still vulnerable to what's called

228
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,440
concept drift

229
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,279
the idea that machine learning

230
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,320
predictions are made by using old

231
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,439
pattern matching are made by using

232
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,640
pattern matching on

233
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,040
old data the old data

234
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,959
never exactly matches the new data so

235
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,399
the predictions can never be exactly

236
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,880
right

237
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,000
to me this is sort of obvious if someone

238
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,480
built a machine that could

239
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,839
accurately predict the future that would

240
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,240
be awesome

241
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,640
to my knowledge unfortunately this does

242
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,880
not exist yet

243
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,399
i want to share an analogy that has to

244
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,439
doing that has to do with using a

245
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,680
machine

246
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,440
to correct spelling errors let's talk

247
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,160
about a spell checker

248
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,399
spell checker is extremely useful but

249
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,399
it's not perfect

250
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,680
look over there at the drawing on the

251
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,399
whiteboard

252
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,920
their ideas are articulated nicely

253
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,200
they're going to take a picture

254
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,199
and share with the rest of the team

255
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,399
a computer program sees nothing wrong

256
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,440
with the spelling of these words

257
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,880
but a human does similarly

258
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,200
when it comes to something like finding

259
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,240
security vulnerabilities in software

260
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,279
computers can't find everything only

261
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,080
humans

262
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,279
can find business logic flaws and these

263
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,320
are often some of the most

264
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,200
interesting and most severe security

265
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,360
vulnerabilities

266
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,920
that there are in his 2011 owasp

267
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,360
presentation called how to protect how

268
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,839
to prevent rather

269
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,959
business flaws vulnerabilities in web

270
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,000
applications

271
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,959
marco morana highlights password reset

272
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,640
flaws

273
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,560
username recovery flaws and the

274
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,199
following e-commerce

275
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,518
business logic attacks altering the

276
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,320
price of an item before checkout

277
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,480
and bypassing payment validation before

278
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,560
shipping an item

279
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,079
it would be super convenient if you

280
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,719
could just buy a piece of technology

281
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,000
that would do

282
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,839
everything for you unfortunately cyber

283
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,760
security scanners and firewalls

284
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,240
can't solve everything their

285
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,040
effectiveness is directly related to the

286
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,279
skills and

287
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,160
manual effort of the people who must

288
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,640
tune them

289
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,600
to a specific environment monitor them

290
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,439
regularly

291
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,440
and filter the signal from the noise

292
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,360
i have been so fascinated by this idea

293
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,120
of human versus machine that my

294
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,519
colleague vanessa sotter and i

295
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,440
decided to look further into it we

296
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,600
recently developed and published

297
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,440
a report called the state of pen testing

298
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,720
2020.

299
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,079
vanessa and i worked together at

300
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,920
cobalt.io and during the last four years

301
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,000
our pen test as a service company has

302
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,279
conducted more than 2500

303
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,360
pen tests through our ptas platform

304
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,720
the report features insights from

305
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,360
aggregated data

306
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,920
derived from nearly 1200 pen tests

307
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,959
conducted in 2019

308
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,040
we also analyzed survey responses

309
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,000
from more than 100 practitioners and

310
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,800
security

311
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,640
development operations and product roles

312
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,719
regarding their application security

313
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,959
programs

314
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,720
finally the report includes insights

315
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,359
from members of our closed

316
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,000
cobalt core pen tester community in

317
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,720
partnership

318
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
with independent researchers engineers

319
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,839
and some other security practitioners

320
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,920
i think that one of the most exciting

321
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,320
topics that this report assesses

322
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,920
is which web application security

323
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,200
vulnerabilities can be found using

324
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,079
machines

325
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,320
and which require human expertise to

326
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,719
manually identify

327
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,639
the scope of this particular exploration

328
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,760
is black box pen testing

329
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:13,040
humans against dynamic scanning

330
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,040
and out-of-band testing machines for web

331
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,519
applications

332
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,760
we investigate these questions and here

333
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,560
are some of the key findings

334
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,160
humans win at finding the following

335
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,199
vulnerability types

336
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,600
business logic bypasses race conditions

337
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,720
and chained exploits and although

338
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,920
machines broadly

339
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,680
win at finding most vulnerability types

340
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,599
when applied correctly

341
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,719
scanning results should be used as

342
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,079
guideposts

343
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,560
and analyzed contextually

344
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,519
there are also vulnerabilities that

345
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,560
neither humans

346
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,720
nor machines can independently find

347
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,000
rather they must work together to

348
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,160
identify these types

349
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,600
of issues some of the types in this

350
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,360
category include things like

351
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,200
authorization flaws

352
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,079
out-of-band xml external entity saml xxz

353
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,839
injection

354
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:08,160
dom-based cross-site scripting insecure

355
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,240
remote code exploitation session

356
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,279
management file upload bugs and sub

357
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,279
domain takeovers

358
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,320
i invite everyone to check out the

359
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,240
report it's totally free to download

360
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,240
it's it's an extensive report it's like

361
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,200
it's like more than 25 pages long

362
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,200
okay so back to our initial subject

363
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,880
which is cyber security talent

364
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,880
mission and culture so the internet was

365
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,360
not built with security in mind

366
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:40,160
the world has a massive talent shortage

367
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,440
and we can't rely on automation to solve

368
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,519
everything

369
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,040
what is happening to the people in this

370
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,040
scenario

371
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,079
if you're on a cyber security team i'm

372
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,199
willing to bet

373
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:53,359
that you have more to do than time and

374
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:55,040
resources to do it

375
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,880
maybe one of your colleagues left for a

376
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,719
new job last month and there are two

377
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,920
additional unfilled positions on your

378
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,519
team you could

379
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,199
actually be in a position where you're

380
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:07,040
trying to do the jobs

381
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:09,120
of four people an issa study found that

382
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,079
70 percent of cyber security

383
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,240
professionals feel

384
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,199
impacted by the talent shortage

385
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,839
resulting in an

386
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,719
increased workload and a situation where

387
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,680
teams spend

388
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,519
more of their time fighting fires than

389
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,040
focusing on training

390
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,160
planning and strategy it is also the

391
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,599
perfect setup

392
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,279
for burnout burnout is described as a

393
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,199
state of chronic stress

394
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,399
that leads to physical and emotional

395
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:38,959
exhaustion cynicism and detachment

396
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,880
and feelings of ineffectiveness and lack

397
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,199
of accomplishment

398
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,360
severe burnout means you can no longer

399
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,800
function effectively on a personal or

400
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,639
professional level

401
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,880
the tricky thing is that burnout doesn't

402
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,839
happen overnight it sort of creeps in

403
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,720
gradually

404
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,880
in this sneaky way that fools us into

405
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,440
thinking that living in a state

406
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,439
of constant stress is normal and

407
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,600
acceptable

408
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,120
living in a state of constant stress

409
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,320
should not be normal

410
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,560
and it is not acceptable today it is

411
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,560
october 2nd in the year 2020

412
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,760
and it has been a particularly weird

413
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,839
year

414
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,560
in february i booked a flight schedule

415
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,000
to depart in july to berlin

416
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,079
in january we had gotten our whole

417
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,040
company together for our

418
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,560
q1 q2 kickoff in san francisco and i was

419
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,319
so looking forward to doing the same

420
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,560
this summer

421
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,040
in march we decided to require all

422
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,040
cobalt employees to work from home

423
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,040
i have two young kids my husband and i

424
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,120
are used to being in school

425
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,680
and since that time we've been adjusting

426
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,079
to being around each other 24x7

427
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,120
this gorgeous background behind me which

428
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,079
you can tell because

429
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,720
actually the skin tone of my shoulder is

430
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,040
a little bit

431
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,560
too close to the skin tone of the floor

432
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,079
in this virtual background

433
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,599
what i'm hiding is my super messy actual

434
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,000
bedroom

435
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,360
in the other corner of which has my

436
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,560
kindergarten daughter's

437
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,759
remote learning setup so we're just

438
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,119
we're all adjusting on june 8th we

439
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,320
announced we're going remote first at

440
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,839
cobalt

441
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,279
and of course sadly i had to cancel my

442
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,839
summer trip to berlin

443
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,519
uh in july we ended up doing our q3 q4

444
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,720
company kickoff virtually

445
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,079
using zoom and breakout rooms i really

446
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,480
miss seeing our team in person

447
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,239
and i am disappointed that we were not

448
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,360
able to share meals and hugs

449
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,959
like we normally would over the past few

450
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,639
months when i've talked with fellow

451
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,279
cyber security practitioners around the

452
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,800
globe

453
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,040
i've learned that many of their

454
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,199
strategies priorities and workflows have

455
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,439
been turned upside down

456
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,639
we are facing unforeseen challenges that

457
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,920
come with facing

458
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:50,639
the unprecedented times that we're in

459
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,599
luckily security professionals are more

460
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,240
adept

461
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,000
in combating the unpredictable than most

462
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,920
the thing is that we've always had to

463
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,199
figure out how to overcome adversity and

464
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,680
adapt to change

465
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:04,159
no one not even the most data-driven

466
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,399
experienced professionals among us can

467
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,640
accurately predict the future

468
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,480
no one has the ability to put together a

469
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,880
perfect plan

470
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,480
what we can do and what i'm thrilled

471
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,760
that we're doing is we can come together

472
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,439
and collaborate

473
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,879
we can share our lessons learned our

474
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,280
success stories

475
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,319
and real examples of how each of us have

476
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,559
pivoted

477
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:27,280
to overcome various obstacles and solve

478
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,280
different problems

479
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:34,879
yesterday i was talking with marcin

480
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:38,000
the ceo at malwarebytes during a

481
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,160
malwarenotes fireside chat um

482
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,320
and we were talking and marcin says to

483
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,720
me caroline

484
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:48,159
what from your perspective has been the

485
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:51,280
impact of covid on cyber security

486
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,160
and i said well we're all super stressed

487
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,000
out

488
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,000
we're all trying to do a lot of things

489
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,039
at once and what that means

490
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
is that we and all the employees at the

491
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,640
companies that we work

492
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,480
for when we're stressed out and anxious

493
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,720
we're a little more likely

494
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:10,080
to fall for social engineering we're a

495
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,160
little more likely to make human errors

496
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,280
this picture is not marcin this picture

497
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,799
is my good friend

498
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:19,600
richard richard has

499
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,879
a great talk that he did at def con a

500
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,039
few years ago

501
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,320
during which he talks about our

502
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:29,039
industry's burnout problem

503
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,760
because of the massive talent shortage

504
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,200
because

505
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,280
of all the other things that are going

506
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,440
on in the world right now it is so

507
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,280
absolutely critical that the

508
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,240
professionals in our industry

509
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,879
take care of themselves because the

510
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,000
world

511
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,880
needs us what we're capable of bringing

512
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,960
to the table

513
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,080
as healthy happy functioning

514
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,919
professionals

515
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:54,480
is simply too valuable to lose

516
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,720
i want to talk with you about some of

517
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,520
the challenges that i've faced

518
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,720
and maybe some piece of it will resonate

519
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,799
with you

520
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,160
and if that's the case maybe we can each

521
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,760
feel a little more

522
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,440
connected and a little less alone

523
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,640
i want to talk to you about a concept

524
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,559
called cognitive behavioral therapy

525
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,440
the basic idea is that our thoughts

526
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,600
emotions and behaviors are all connected

527
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,640
and that you have the power to change or

528
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,080
at least influence

529
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,000
one by changing the other so to do

530
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,159
it you identify a negative thought

531
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,400
process and then you try to change it

532
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,320
into a positive one

533
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,720
this can be easier said than done

534
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,360
because our negative thought processes

535
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,240
are often

536
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:41,199
so deep seated in our brains that we

537
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:44,640
don't even realize that they're there

538
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,640
i'm going to talk through an example

539
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,720
my parents are immigrants and they

540
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,600
raised me to be able to take care of

541
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,919
myself

542
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,439
and to have as many choices in life as

543
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,080
possible

544
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,840
when i was a kid growing up doing well

545
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,559
in school was a really big deal

546
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,399
in my household as a child and a

547
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,440
teenager i did well in school

548
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,200
and that felt good but when i started

549
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,760
the electrical engineering and computer

550
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,320
science program at uc berkeley

551
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,919
all of a sudden that part of my identity

552
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,240
changed

553
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,280
it took me decades to develop the core

554
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,400
belief that i am

555
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:23,440
smart and that i work hard

556
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,960
unfortunately over time i also began to

557
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,280
develop a few

558
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,159
associated core beliefs that are quite

559
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:32,480
negative and self-defeating

560
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,960
number one my worth comes from my

561
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,120
success in school and work

562
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,720
number two if i am not constantly

563
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,000
exceeding expectations

564
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,640
then i am a failure number three

565
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,520
i need to work harder and unless i am

566
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,520
succeeding

567
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:52,080
i don't deserve to be treated well

568
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,960
over the past decade or so i've worked

569
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,360
hard

570
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,159
to try and replace these negative belief

571
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,240
processes

572
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,240
in my brain with positive ones

573
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:08,240
oops i accept myself

574
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,840
as i am right now i know and i approve

575
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,520
of myself

576
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:17,120
i embrace balance i encourage myself

577
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,360
to play and enjoy life

578
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,039
at this point in the talk we've got

579
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,959
about 20 minutes left

580
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:26,000
it's time to shift gears and talk about

581
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,520
key takeaways for hiring managers

582
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,159
i'm going to share some of the

583
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,720
strategies that we use at cobalt

584
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,559
to attract retain and grow awesome

585
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,280
talent

586
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,559
first you want to attract great people

587
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,799
and i'll tell you what

588
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,399
when it comes to cyber security pretty

589
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,960
much everyone with strong skills and

590
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,280
experience

591
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,039
already has a job they're not super

592
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,678
likely to go to your company's job

593
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,840
posting site and submit their resume

594
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,600
that's not to say that inbound

595
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,240
candidates aren't valuable

596
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,158
but you cannot rely on them alone to

597
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,760
fill your positions

598
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,840
as a hiring manager you've got to be

599
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,120
proactive and opportunistic when it

600
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,799
comes to recruiting

601
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,639
you need to go and find the people that

602
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,559
you want to hire

603
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,200
know that you will need to do a lot of

604
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,280
outreach if you have a great recruiter

605
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,360
this person can help but i think the

606
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,720
best person to do outreach is the hiring

607
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,879
manager

608
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,679
i know this takes time and time is a

609
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,799
precious and a finite resource

610
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,880
it is simply a matter of prioritization

611
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,720
if you want to attract great people to

612
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,080
your team you must make hiring a

613
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,000
priority

614
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,760
if you find someone amazing and they

615
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,679
don't happen to exactly match your

616
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,080
original job description

617
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,640
consider updating the jd or changing

618
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,120
your hiring strategy

619
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,720
once you've made an offer to a candidate

620
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,719
and they've accepted

621
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,679
your next priority should be to keep

622
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,760
them assuming they perform

623
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,679
some employee retention programs have

624
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,000
perks like free snacks and

625
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,679
pay gym membership but i've come to

626
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,960
realize that what really matters to

627
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:04,640
people is something different

628
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:06,720
in 2012 google conducted a study

629
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,159
to try and figure out how to build the

630
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,919
perfect team

631
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,000
they examined everything from how

632
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,919
frequently people eat together

633
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,280
to common traits between the best

634
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,480
managers

635
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:20,559
they analyzed 180 teams

636
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,799
throughout the company and they also

637
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:25,360
reviewed half a century's work

638
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,879
worth of academic studies on how teams

639
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,600
work

640
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,320
surprisingly the data didn't seem to

641
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,439
show

642
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,678
that a mix of specific personality types

643
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,000
skills or backgrounds made any

644
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,400
significant difference

645
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,960
it turns out that what does matter is

646
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,720
something called psychological safety

647
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,440
a sense of confidence that the team will

648
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,400
not embarrass reject or punish someone

649
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,919
for speaking up teams are always going

650
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,679
to have their issues

651
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,360
regardless of whether people talk about

652
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,960
them or not

653
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,039
team members that trust each other are

654
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,960
more likely to share information

655
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,158
so that issues can come to the surface

656
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,679
and be managed

657
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:07,120
efficiently and proactively

658
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,120
another thing that i think it's

659
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,439
absolutely critical for hiring managers

660
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,520
to do is to grow their people

661
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,919
i think this matters even more when it

662
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,600
comes to the cyber security field

663
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,159
it's important for every business

664
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,320
function to have well-defined levels

665
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,159
so that team members understand what is

666
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,439
expected of them to get to the next

667
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,880
level

668
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,799
performance reviews don't need to be

669
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,799
onerous but they should be structured

670
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,720
so that team members can have productive

671
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,639
conversations with their managers

672
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,880
about where they are today and where

673
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,880
they're heading tomorrow

674
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,919
high performing individuals should be

675
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,320
acknowledged and promoted

676
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,080
when i began my new role as head of

677
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,840
people at cobalt

678
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,760
i asked our people operations manager

679
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,199
for a book recommendation

680
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,840
she told me about this book called

681
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,679
sapiens one of the concepts that this

682
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,840
book talks about is how humans can

683
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,000
create and maintain culture

684
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,678
through one-on-one relationships and

685
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,520
this works until a group reaches about

686
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,240
100 people

687
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,039
at that point something more is needed

688
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,480
to support

689
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:12,640
and enforce cultural values

690
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,120
when cobalt was growing from 8 to 50

691
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,559
people it was easy enough to involve

692
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,719
pretty much everyone in the hiring

693
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,799
process and in this way we made sure

694
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,880
that new hires brought onto the team

695
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,879
were adding to the culture in a positive

696
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,320
way that was aligned with our core

697
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,120
values

698
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,559
as we prepared for growth from 50 to 100

699
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,879
to 120 and now we're headed toward

700
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:35,600
150 we knew it was time to write down

701
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,720
our values

702
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:41,678
in order to scale the people decisions

703
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,320
on who to hire who to promote and who to

704
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,600
transition

705
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,678
out of the company our ceo

706
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,439
conducted an exercise where he asked us

707
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,840
all to stand in a circle

708
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,000
and one by one he would ask individuals

709
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,799
to come into the middle of the circle

710
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,679
and he would talk about the observable

711
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,480
values

712
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,480
that these people represented so for

713
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,000
example he asked robert coogler to come

714
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,120
into the middle of this of the circle

715
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,120
and he said you know

716
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,719
i love working with robert he's got

717
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,520
amazing enthusiasm

718
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,960
he's always optimistic he is not afraid

719
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,960
to get his hands dirty

720
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,880
he's collaborative and he's always

721
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,840
thinking about how to make things faster

722
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,799
and better

723
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,279
and how to use automation and then he

724
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,200
asked

725
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,640
you know my colleague marion to come and

726
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,240
join him in the circle he said you know

727
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,360
marion is structured

728
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,679
she's systematic she's humble and she's

729
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:34,000
always looking to learn and get better

730
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,000
she's hard-working she's motivated and

731
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,200
she gets done

732
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,279
so what we did was jacob called

733
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,480
one by one about a dozen of our team

734
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,559
members into

735
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,960
the middle of the circle and he talked

736
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:49,760
about the way in which each of these

737
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,799
individuals exemplifies the values that

738
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,240
we want to have

739
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:55,200
on our team we put it all in a

740
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,760
spreadsheet

741
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,240
we invited everyone in the company to

742
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,559
you know

743
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,760
jointly collaborate and tell us what

744
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,520
they thought

745
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,200
and we came up with the following and

746
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,000
i'll read kind of the short version

747
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,320
because i would like

748
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,880
actually to have some time at the end if

749
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:13,200
there are any questions

750
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,720
so we have four values now one of them

751
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,840
is humble learning so at cobalt we're

752
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,279
humble learners

753
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,879
what we did yesterday may not work

754
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,200
tomorrow we approach

755
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,399
problem solving with a creative growth

756
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,240
mindset

757
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,080
we know that sometimes failure is part

758
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,840
of a natural learning process

759
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,320
we humbly seek to learn from subject

760
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:33,678
matter experts we believe everyone has

761
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,960
something to contribute the next is lead

762
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,720
with grit

763
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,399
we know that achievement comes from a

764
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,440
strong work ethic and relentless

765
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:43,120
execution

766
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:46,559
we do not quit when the going gets tough

767
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,559
we produce quality at speed

768
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,520
this is an interesting one right because

769
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,120
some folks

770
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,399
i think have a belief that you can

771
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,360
either have quality or you can have

772
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,678
speed

773
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,959
we actually believe that you can do both

774
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,640
and the way to do that is via

775
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,279
prioritization

776
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,880
we say no to what is not important we

777
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,399
focus on the things that are important

778
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,840
and we get those done

779
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:10,959
with quality at speed and finally we are

780
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,559
one cobalt

781
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,880
we believe that when we collaborate we

782
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:17,039
can make two plus two equal ten

783
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,720
we respect our colleagues and we value

784
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,720
each person's unique contribution

785
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,159
so those are some of my takeaways for

786
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:30,158
hiring managers

787
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:32,399
i also have takeaways for all of us

788
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,320
so i want to tell you something that i

789
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:36,320
realized a couple of years ago

790
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,240
and that is for those of us that have

791
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,039
and are developing our skills in cyber

792
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,720
security

793
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,320
there is a really beautiful silver

794
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,440
lining to the talent gap

795
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,799
which is that we have choices four years

796
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,039
ago in 2016

797
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:51,120
my daughter was one year old and it

798
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:53,279
became apparent to me that my lifestyle

799
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,158
as a traveling management consultant

800
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,200
needed to change i began to search for a

801
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,559
local job

802
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,320
and i spoke with 15 different

803
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,918
organizations about various cyber

804
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,918
security roles

805
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,399
that was an extremely fortunate position

806
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:09,520
to be in

807
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:11,678
during my job search in 2016 the number

808
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,720
one criteria i looked for

809
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:18,799
was people that i like and respect

810
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,559
who like and respect me it turns out

811
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:23,679
that being surrounded by people that i

812
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:25,600
trust makes my life a lot better

813
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,440
my number two criteria was the ability

814
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,199
to have a big impact

815
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,919
and that's why for the first time in my

816
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:35,440
career i joined a startup

817
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:39,600
and it has been awesome so

818
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:42,559
my advice for everyone because right now

819
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,799
you know those of us with kids first of

820
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,200
all

821
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,000
we're extraordinarily fortunate to be in

822
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,080
an industry

823
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,600
where we can do our jobs working

824
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,639
remotely

825
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,719
and some of us have kids at home

826
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,480
and some of us haven't been able to hug

827
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:00,159
our friends in six months

828
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,840
and you know i'm i'm used to getting on

829
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,360
a plane every month and going and

830
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,158
traveling and seeing friends and

831
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,678
colleagues and

832
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:10,960
and there's a lot about normal life

833
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:13,279
that i really miss and it's it's just

834
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:17,279
really busy

835
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:20,399
the advice that i try to follow

836
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:22,000
myself and that i share with others is

837
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:25,840
that it's important to get to know

838
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,200
yourself uh just as much as we cyber

839
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,959
security practitioners

840
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,679
obsess over the latest breach and how it

841
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,480
happened

842
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:37,039
uh the latest zero day exploit and how

843
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,919
it worked i actually think it's equally

844
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,158
as important

845
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,159
maybe more important to pay attention

846
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,399
how each of us feel

847
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,159
and for us to manage our energy

848
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:49,840
accordingly

849
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:53,120
so there is a wealth of knowledge

850
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:56,959
about how to manage one's time

851
00:30:53,120 --> 00:31:00,080
so much content about time management

852
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:03,440
what i like to advocate for is actually

853
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,559
energy management there's only 24 hours

854
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,880
in a day

855
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,840
but depending on my energy level i can

856
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,399
either feel

857
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,840
totally depleted and like i have nothing

858
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:14,719
left to give

859
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,600
or i can feel inspired like my tank is

860
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,799
full

861
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:21,760
and like i can't accomplish anything

862
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,320
my recommendation to you is to find out

863
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,200
what

864
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,799
activities give you energy and what

865
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:32,080
takes it away from you

866
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:34,080
and choose your activities accordingly

867
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,559
depending on how much time i have to

868
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,399
give this talk um i like to go through a

869
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,200
few things that i do to take care of

870
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,799
myself

871
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:46,000
to try and create energy in my life um

872
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:48,158
yes john you have no concerns about

873
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,279
time you just go you're the last speaker

874
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,440
okay cool cool

875
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,640

876
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,519
want to kick you off

877
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,360

878
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,559
much john i appreciate it

879
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,678
and you know this next part it's kind of

880
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,360
like

881
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,080
choose your own adventure so at this

882
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,639
point if folks have questions

883
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,158
i would love to respond to questions if

884
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,600
folks want to know what kinds of things

885
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,799
i do to take care of myself

886
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:17,039
i would love to share about that

887
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:20,080
and then finally if folks are interested

888
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:23,279
i also have a prepared guided meditation

889
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,720
uh that i can lead folks through so uh

890
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,799
perhaps if i was a little bit more

891
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,480
proactive about planning this session i

892
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,279
could have done some sort of fancy poll

893
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,200
thing

894
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,720
um but that being said i don't know

895
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,399
actually if when i'm presenting i can

896
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,880
see if there's any q a

897
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,559
um if there is q a i would i would love

898
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,360
to chat with people about what questions

899
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,240
they have

900
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,678
uh if not i'm happy to go into the other

901
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,080
two pieces of content that i have

902
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,080
prepared

903
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,679
we don't have anything in q a right now

904
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,678
anybody have any questions please

905
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,799
please uh add them to q a we'd like to

906
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,480
have a discussion here make this

907
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:06,240
interactive

908
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:11,039
cool in the meantime caroline yeah

909
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,480
yeah in the meantime um there is some

910
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,080
there are some ideas that i'd love to

911
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,720
share with folks about

912
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:19,360
you know i had an opportunity to give

913
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,799
this talk at b-sides

914
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:26,320
and someone said to me

915
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:28,480
you know when i think about my identity

916
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,678
so much of what i do is wrapped up in my

917
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,440
work

918
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,000
and so it kind of feels like all i'm

919
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,159
doing all day is cyber security

920
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,200
and sometimes i love it and sometimes

921
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,960
it's not great

922
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,760
you know but how do you kind of carve

923
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,440
out time for stuff and i said you know

924
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,799
there are all these ways in which we can

925
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,360
define ourselves

926
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,399
you know when i choose which shirt to

927
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,639
wear

928
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,439
and which color to wear and which shoes

929
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,279
to wear

930
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,120
you know what i choose to do in five

931
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,240
minutes between meetings whether it's

932
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,239
doodling

933
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,600
um there there are these ways so a

934
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,399
couple ways that i

935
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,760
so there's these three categories that i

936
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:06,799
want to talk about

937
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,320
mind body and spirit

938
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,079
and here are simply a few things that

939
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,839
have worked for me

940
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:17,040
so when it comes to the mind

941
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:19,040
over the past several years i've tried

942
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,639
experimenting with meditation

943
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,960
sometimes i'll get into a place

944
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,240
admittedly where i press play

945
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,399
on my meditation app and then i promptly

946
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,078
you know sort of decide to ignore it

947
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:32,319
while i go do something else

948
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,520
that's not that's not the way that works

949
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,520
the best for me

950
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,079
um but today one of the nice things

951
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,159
about things like meditation apps is

952
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,119
there's actually meditations as short as

953
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,679
one minute or

954
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,159
three minutes long and so that kind of

955
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,040
thing

956
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:49,839
you know i think we can all find one or

957
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,480
three minutes in a day

958
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:54,320
journaling is one of those things that

959
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,520
for me

960
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,760
it's easier said than done it falls into

961
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:02,000
this category of

962
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,040
when would i possibly find time in a day

963
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,960
to write

964
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,480
for no particular productive reason

965
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,280
there's all sorts of writing that i need

966
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,400
to do

967
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,880
for you know important

968
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,599
work reasons why would i why would i

969
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,040
just write

970
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,160
to myself about myself um and actually

971
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,720
that

972
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,240
that ties a bit into the next category

973
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,560
which is therapy

974
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,240
um after this session actually uh in

975
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,680
about 50 minutes i'll be speaking with

976
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,078
my therapist

977
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,560
an incredible person that i've gotten to

978
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:36,400
know over the past eight or so years

979
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:38,960
um to me there's something magical about

980
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,920
talking with someone for 50 minutes a

981
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,200
week

982
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,880
just about you it's someone who

983
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,319
doesn't even really know you you know

984
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,920
they don't play an active role in your

985
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,320
life they're not your spouse

986
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,440
you know they're not your friend uh they

987
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,800
have no agenda

988
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,160
really um and that for me has has helped

989
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:00,079
a lot

990
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:02,240
um i'm also not ashamed to say that

991
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,440
when i need it i'll take advantage of

992
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,118
medication

993
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,560
this morning i took 40 milligrams of

994
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:12,079
prozac and for me that helps

995
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:15,119
i also especially as a relatively new

996
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,960
mom uh for me and then i also

997
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,640
spent the last you know more than three

998
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,400
decades of my life in california which

999
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,640
is on fire

1000
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,079
there's a lot to be said for insurance

1001
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,799
and the peace of mind that that brings

1002
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,359
for me

1003
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,760
um for me as a mom with kids life

1004
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:32,160
insurance is super important

1005
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,720
i think it's extraordinarily important

1006
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:37,040
for us to take vacation

1007
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,399
it's so easy for us as cyber security

1008
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,920
professionals to just work

1009
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:44,560
and work and work um and i think that

1010
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,079
when we take vacation when we step away

1011
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,839
from our computers

1012
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,920
when we get to take a break we can

1013
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:52,480
actually bring so much

1014
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,599
back with us when we return you know to

1015
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,359
the office

1016
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,960
um and i also think there's something to

1017
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,799
be said about art

1018
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,119
my daughter's five years old now i do a

1019
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,440
lot of art and craft projects with her

1020
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,320
um and it's actually fun i have found

1021
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,200
that it

1022
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,680
it can be fun for no reason other than

1023
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,919
for fun

1024
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,520
when it comes so another thing is that

1025
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,640
you know we as humans

1026
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:19,359
uh we're our destiny is constrained by

1027
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:21,680
our biology

1028
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,480
there are ways to take care of our

1029
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,879
bodies

1030
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,640
and to enhance you know what they're

1031
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,079
capable of doing

1032
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:33,279
um i find that when i get enough sleep

1033
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,240
i feel better i have more energy i find

1034
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,119
that when

1035
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,520
i eat certain foods i feel better and

1036
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:42,960
when i eat certain foods i feel worse

1037
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:45,440
um as a person who

1038
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,560
spent pretty much all of my 20s living

1039
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,359
in san francisco

1040
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,160
and living off of you know eating out

1041
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:53,359
with friends

1042
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,118
and ordering takeout from restaurants um

1043
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:56,960
it's been a pleasure for me to discover

1044
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,160
that cooking actually gives me a great

1045
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,200
deal of joy

1046
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:04,720
um exercise is important

1047
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:07,118
if and when you can make it happen

1048
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,078
and i have this sort of generic word

1049
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,520
here which says

1050
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:12,079
care and it's really silly but what i

1051
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,839
mean

1052
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:18,960
by it is actually in my case so

1053
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:23,279
maybe this is tmi maybe it's not

1054
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:25,440
but um i have dust and pollen allergies

1055
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,680
and it took me years to figure out if i

1056
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,400
just take my daily medication

1057
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,240
for dust and pollen allergies i actually

1058
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,640
feel way better um

1059
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,759
so things like that things like i have

1060
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,440
flat feet

1061
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,720
and while they may not be the most

1062
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:43,680
attractive if i wear my orthopedic shoes

1063
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,879
it actually feels better so i just wear

1064
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,839
the expensive

1065
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,839
orthopedic shoes

1066
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:55,759
i do think that there's something

1067
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,160
about taking care of what i hear use a

1068
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,640
term

1069
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,640
spirit

1070
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:07,119
i've worked in organizations where

1071
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:10,240
i don't feel

1072
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:12,160
safe i don't feel comfortable um

1073
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,319
and when i work in an organization where

1074
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:17,440
i'm surrounded by people that i respect

1075
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:22,240
and like that i feel respect and like me

1076
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,240
that makes my spirit feel good

1077
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,759
there are all sorts of jobs in cyber

1078
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,240
security

1079
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,119
you know and and some of us you know we

1080
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,240
can choose to

1081
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:36,000
have different levels of impact

1082
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:38,479
and i used to work for a video game

1083
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,480
company

1084
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:45,200
and for me to have my life's work

1085
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,640
to have what i do for eight plus hours

1086
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,759
every weekday

1087
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:52,160
be securing farmville

1088
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,560
you know that to me at the end of the

1089
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,118
day was just like not enough

1090
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,119
you know um but i think that in cyber

1091
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,119
security we actually have

1092
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,480
tremendous opportunities to do very

1093
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,680
impactful work

1094
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,480
and that can be really good for our

1095
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:08,319
spirit i think it's super important for

1096
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,160
us to spend time with our family with

1097
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:11,759
our friends with our pets

1098
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,680
and not just be with our co-workers all

1099
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,880
the time even if our co-workers are

1100
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,839
super awesome um sometimes our

1101
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,960
colleagues

1102
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:22,319
they are part of our tribes you know we

1103
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,760
as humans

1104
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:26,560
you know for thousands of years depended

1105
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,440
on each other

1106
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,480
for survival and we we have that in us

1107
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,599
you know we have that

1108
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:37,200
in the ways that our brains work

1109
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:38,800
um so being with people that treat you

1110
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:42,078
well

1111
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:44,240
that's a good thing i also am

1112
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,200
a very anxious person and i've been

1113
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,919
working on that

1114
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,439
and in these days there it feels like

1115
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,960
there's a lot to be anxious about i

1116
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,240
think there's always a lot to be anxious

1117
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,640
about

1118
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,680
one of the tips that my therapist shared

1119
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:59,279
with me that i

1120
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:00,078
that i try to use sometimes is this idea

1121
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,200
that

1122
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:04,319
maybe despite how good we think we are

1123
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,240
at multitasking

1124
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:07,920
maybe our minds can actually only focus

1125
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,919
on one thing at a time

1126
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,760
and if i choose to think about something

1127
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,760
i'm grateful for

1128
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,880
maybe there actually is less room for me

1129
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,200
to think about

1130
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:20,720
what i'm scared of or to think about

1131
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:23,118
what i'm anxious and worried about

1132
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,919
and things like rituals you know i think

1133
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,319
that

1134
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:31,680
a year like this one is one that

1135
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:34,160
has helped me to really question why i

1136
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,680
do the things that i do and it's given

1137
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:39,520
me a chance on some space

1138
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:41,680
to decide what i want to do um

1139
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,280
until this year i was never actually

1140
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,200
able to do things like

1141
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,119
put my phone down an hour before i went

1142
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,759
and tried to sleep

1143
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:50,960
and now i do and i light a candle and i

1144
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,280
have some

1145
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,640
uh i have some nice essential oils that

1146
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,880
i like to smell

1147
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,680
um so these are these are some things

1148
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,960
you know i

1149
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:03,919
actually uh a decade or so ago

1150
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,880
had a pretty severe burnout problem i

1151
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,119
had

1152
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,720
somewhat of a mental breakdown and so

1153
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,520
these are just a few ideas that i've

1154
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,879
cultivated

1155
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:16,240
really over the last decade of my life

1156
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:19,040
um and with that

1157
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,479
maybe for folks that are still with us

1158
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:23,040
um

1159
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,560
if you want to close your eyes and

1160
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:27,839
indulge me

1161
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:31,759
uh we can do a short guided meditation

1162
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:35,040
to end the session so

1163
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:37,040
i'll invite you if you want to to close

1164
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,279
your eyes

1165
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,960
relax into a position that's comfortable

1166
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,079
for you

1167
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,640
and to begin focusing your attention on

1168
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,640
your breath

1169
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,319
imagine that every time you breathe out

1170
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,520
you settle

1171
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:56,400
deeper into your position and everything

1172
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,400
slows down

1173
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,680
i'm sorry i'm trying to join you join

1174
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:11,200
you here cool cool very good yeah

1175
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:15,279
see if you can breathe in just a little

1176
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,279
longer breathe out just a little longer

1177
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:20,640
this is a practice of being

1178
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,319
of sitting with yourself in the present

1179
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,560
moment

1180
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:26,720
there's nothing in this moment that you

1181
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,040
need to do

1182
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,200
there's nothing to seek out there's

1183
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:33,040
nothing to try

1184
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,078
you can just kind of chill in this

1185
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,079
moment and just breathe

1186
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,200
maybe your mind is trying to

1187
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,400
problem-solve we are always trying to

1188
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,000
problem-self

1189
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,599
maybe you're trying to make the

1190
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,800
meditation work

1191
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:52,800
maybe you long to feel connected and if

1192
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:55,760
you notice these types of thoughts

1193
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,960
these types of emotions coming up just

1194
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,000
notice them

1195
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,160
and let them go like clouds moving

1196
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,319
across the sky

1197
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,879
bring yourself back to your breath

1198
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:09,839
breathe in

1199
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,839
and breathe out

1200
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:20,560
i believe that within each of us

1201
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:23,680
within a matter of minutes it is

1202
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:26,720
possible for us to stop

1203
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:30,000
and take a breath and engage

1204
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:33,759
and connect with the infinity

1205
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,920
that is in each of us there is a space

1206
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,920
that exists within each of us where we

1207
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,720
can release our thoughts and emotions

1208
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,920
and just

1209
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:45,759
be and just listen

1210
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:48,240
for a moment and sometimes

1211
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,599
when i'm able to do this if there's

1212
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,279
guidance i'm looking for

1213
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:53,599
if there are decisions that i'm thinking

1214
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:55,359
about if there are emotions that i'm

1215
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:58,800
managing

1216
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:04,160
i like to imagine releasing those things

1217
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:08,000
every time i breathe out

1218
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:11,839
and just allowing myself to be here

1219
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:15,440
right now with no agenda

1220
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:18,319
with no expectations with no attachment

1221
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:22,560
with no desires

1222
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:22,560
just a moment of presence

1223
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:34,000
there's this idea that i

1224
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:34,880
like and that i want us to consider in

1225
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,359
this moment that

1226
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,240
everything you could possibly want might

1227
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:42,160
already be

1228
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:45,919
here might already be in you

1229
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:48,240
and all you might have to do is just

1230
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,240
listen

1231
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,440
