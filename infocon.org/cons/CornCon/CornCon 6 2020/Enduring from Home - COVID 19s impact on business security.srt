00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:36,159
awesome thanks so much john

80
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,159
hello everybody can you hear me okay

81
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,680
sounds good awesome all right well we're

82
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,720
going to be talking about a report that

83
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,480
malwarebytes

84
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,560
uh completed uh really recently

85
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,159
and the report is about the enduring

86
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,840
from home basically

87
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,280
what happened to businesses when they

88
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,319
suddenly had to switch

89
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,879
from a in-person office type model

90
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,159
of working to almost entirely remote so

91
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,439
we're going to talk about that a little

92
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,879
bit

93
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,480
and the results that we got from a

94
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,798
survey asking a lot of these folks how

95
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,798
they did

96
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,720
so as mentioned my name is adam kujawa

97
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,560
and i am uh

98
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,519
one of the directors in maura bytes labs

99
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,358
at maura bytes

100
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,320
so let's just go ahead and jump into it

101
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,918
we got a lot of information to cover

102
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,840
so in march for companies across the

103
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,320
united states business as usual became

104
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,479
business

105
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,159
uncharted as the novel coronavirus

106
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,520
spreads throughout the nation at an

107
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,040
unchecked pace

108
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,320
faced with shelter-in-place orders in

109
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,000
their home countries and states

110
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,719
countless companies transitioned to

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,880
entirely remote workforces predictably

112
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,240
these near immediate transitions carried

113
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,759
with them some setbacks

114
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,280
a remote workforce can become a

115
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,360
workforce stretch thin

116
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,638
communication must adapt to online

117
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,880
models of email

118
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,040
chat messaging and video conferencing

119
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,240
collaboration must move to cloud-based

120
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,160
storage platforms

121
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,400
and keeping businesses afloat must take

122
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,199
into account the unique cyber security

123
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,719
needs

124
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,720
for now remote workers who are

125
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,520
connecting to potentially unsecured home

126
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,440
networks

127
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,599
while accessing accessing company

128
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,080
resources from personal devices

129
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,520
all without the direct support found

130
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,359
from within the office

131
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,919
so admirabis who wanted to dig deeper

132
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,199
into today's new work from home normal

133
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,198
measuring not just the immediate

134
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,880
reaction to the pandemic but also

135
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,880
businesses planned cyber security

136
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,479
strategy for the future

137
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,240
the results from our study exposed a

138
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,800
concerning theme and that is security

139
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,440
hubris

140
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,440
and we'll talk about that a little later

141
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,638
real quick i need to fix something there

142
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,639
we go

143
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,000
all right so let's talk about the

144
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,120
methodology here why why did we do this

145
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,919
how do we do this more specifically

146
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,800
so we surveyed more than 200 managers

147
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,440
directors

148
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,400
and c-suite executives in it and cyber

149
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,120
security roles

150
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,000
companies across the us these roles

151
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,360
included i t

152
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,960
manager i t director and i t executives

153
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,039
our respondents covered the gamut of

154
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,799
company sizes with some working as small

155
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,240
and medium-sized businesses

156
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,560
and others at large enterprise

157
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,400
organizations

158
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,720
we grouped participants into the company

159
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,479
size as you see on the right side there

160
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,400
and our survey of roughly one dozen

161
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,400
questions tracked respondents concerns

162
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,799
about transitioning to work from home

163
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,638
the impact suffered due to the pandemic

164
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,160
and their plans to implement long-term

165
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,160
security changes moving ahead

166
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,919
so enough about that let's get to the

167
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,919
takeaways what do people say

168
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,280
so our survey found that a majority of

169
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,880
respondents scored their organizations

170
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,638
rather high when evaluating their

171
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,280
readiness to transition

172
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,680
to work from home this may be an example

173
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,520
of an

174
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,600
often difficult to measure phenomenon

175
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,520
that we like to call security hubris

176
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,360
which is also the overconfidence in

177
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,359
limited security measures deployed

178
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,000
a good example of this would be that 73

179
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,560
percent of respondents scored their

180
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,319
organizations a 7 out of 10 or higher

181
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,080
when determining their readiness for

182
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,960
transitioning to work from home

183
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,800
and at the same time 44 of respondents

184
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,758
organizations did not provide cyber

185
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,840
security training

186
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,960
that focused on potential threats of

187
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,039
working from home

188
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,120
like ensuring that home networks had

189
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,599
strong passwords or devices were not

190
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,800
left

191
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:21,360
in the reach of non-authorized users and

192
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,319
uh in addition to that 45 of respondents

193
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,880
organizations

194
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,880
did not perform security and online

195
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,159
privacy analysis of software tools

196
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,759
deemed necessary

197
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,680
in transition to work from home so a lot

198
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,720
of these folks just started using

199
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,680
software because they thought they

200
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,800
should

201
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,639
uh and 61 of respondents organizations

202
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,560
provided work issued devices to

203
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,240
employees as needed which is great

204
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,960
however 65 percent

205
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,520
uh did not deploy new anti-virus

206
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,440
solutions for those same devices so

207
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,440
uh here's a here's a work laptop we

208
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,000
didn't put anything on it good luck

209
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,080
um finally 61 of respondents

210
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,240
organizations did not urge employees to

211
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,599
use antivirus on their personal devices

212
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,840
and we'll talk more about personal

213
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,840
device use uh that we did kind of delve

214
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,359
into in the survey in a little bit

215
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,840
so while some of these numbers may

216
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,759
present uh the picture of an insecure

217
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,119
vulnerable workforce there's actually a

218
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,639
flip side to the data

219
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,479
for example while nearly half of our

220
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,800
respondents may not have provided cyber

221
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,120
security training to their employees

222
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,800
the other half did the same is true for

223
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,080
the 55 percent of respondents that

224
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,840
perform security

225
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,840
and online privacy analysis of software

226
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
tools

227
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,440
so to understand the volume of work it

228
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,959
teams would need to tackle in the

229
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,880
transition of work from home

230
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,399
we asked survey participants to tell us

231
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,159
the percentage of employees that were

232
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,320
moved to a work from home model

233
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,080
about one-third of respondents about

234
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,959
33.2 percent

235
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,480
moved 81 to 100 percent if not all of

236
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,040
their employees home

237
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,480
and 142 respondents or a little more

238
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,120
than 70 percent

239
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,560
move 61 or more of the workforce to a

240
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,160
work from home model

241
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,959
so a majority of companies with less

242
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,760
than 700 employees which is about 84.1

243
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,439
percent

244
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,439
moved more than half of their workforce

245
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,040
but not all uh

246
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,040
to work from home and on the other hand

247
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,800
companies with at least 700 employees

248
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,959
opted to moving almost their entire

249
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,839
workforce home

250
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,839
it's a lot of numbers

251
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,680
so the shift from working in the office

252
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,279
to working from home to not erase

253
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,199
cyber security problems that were

254
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,040
already there pre-covered

255
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,360
if anything organizations were presented

256
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,640
with new compounding challenges that had

257
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,640
to be addressed without delay

258
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,199
companies that were able to successfully

259
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,360
transition to work from home ran

260
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,200
in the problems more than half of it

261
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,880
leaders surveyed reported facing at

262
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,320
least three different challenges listed

263
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,399
on a questionnaire

264
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,600
so the challenges that were cited by

265
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,600
most respondents

266
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,279
was training employees on how to be

267
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,360
security compliant at home

268
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,519
and over 55 percent of people said they

269
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,279
don't they're worried about that

270
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,560
followed by setting up work or personal

271
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:02,000
devices with necessary

272
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,719
software 51 percent of participants felt

273
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,560
shifting

274
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,920
to a new remote model of communication

275
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,760
was a challenge as well

276
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,000
and the challenge selected by the fewest

277
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,640
respondents was ensuring work-life

278
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,839
balance

279
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,519
at only 36 percent and i think after

280
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,880
seven and nine months of us all working

281
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,959
from home i'm

282
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,640
i kind of wish we all had a little more

283
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,640
attention on our work-life balance right

284
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,920
so when asked about the their biggest

285
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,320
cyber security concerns

286
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,199
now that all or a portion of their

287
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,440
employees

288
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,240
are working remotely it's clear that

289
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,320
managers

290
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,600
directors and executives are most

291
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,839
concerned about

292
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,839
other individuals in the home who have

293
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,920
access to an employee's device and might

294
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,680
inadvertently compromise it

295
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,760
other concerns that stand out are

296
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,239
difficulties associated with managing

297
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,399
devices using remote work resources

298
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,240
the possibility of it not being able to

299
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,000
support employees efficiently

300
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,079
the general lack of adequate cyber

301
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,320
security measures over resources

302
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:04,160
including cloud collaboration tools and

303
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,160
the use of personal networks and devices

304
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,120
so to measure participants confidence in

305
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,120
their work from home readiness we asked

306
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,399
managers directors and executives across

307
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,200
all the business sizes

308
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,440
us regions and industries to rate how

309
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,079
prepared their organization was

310
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,640
to go uh from in office to working from

311
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,800
home

312
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,640
and on a scale of one to ten with one

313
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,680
representing the least prepared

314
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,600
and 10 representing the most of the 200

315
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,519
uh respondents the average ranking was

316
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,120
about 7.23

317
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,279
in fact roughly three quarters of those

318
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,000
we surveyed gave the organization

319
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,760
a score of seven or above on the

320
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
preparedness to for the transition to

321
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,319
work

322
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,399
from home on the flip side only 14

323
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,800
percent scored the company a 4 out of 10

324
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,800
or less

325
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,320
so despite finding training employees on

326
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,240
security compliance to be a challenge

327
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,240
uh 47 percent of respondents were

328
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,480
confident that their employees were

329
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,720
very aware of the cyber security best

330
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,480
practices they needed to follow at home

331
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,240
a much smaller portion believed their

332
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,120
employees were acutely aware

333
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,639
and mindful to avoid risk and only 5.4

334
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,079
percent of it leaders said their

335
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:18,320
employees were oblivious and risky

336
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,560
people have a lot of confidence well

337
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,240
some people do

338
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,719
respondents and directors and executive

339
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,240
positions expressed more confidence

340
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,200
than managers in their employees

341
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,839
awareness of cyber security procedures

342
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,839
while 20.5 percent of executives said

343
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,320
their staff was acutely aware

344
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,440
just 16.2 percent of managers felt the

345
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,160
same way

346
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,680
conversely only 1.7 percent of directors

347
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,560
stated their employees were

348
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,399
oblivious and risky compared to 7.6

349
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,040
percent of managers

350
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,040
so do the managers just see the real

351
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,920
picture and know the actual

352
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,519
uh threat that's out there or are they

353
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,160
just more cynical than directors and

354
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,160
executives

355
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,720
so uh naturally after transitioning to a

356
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,839
remote workforce

357
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,040
50 57 of respondents said their usage of

358
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,600
remote tools

359
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,680
uh such as zoom and microsoft teams and

360
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,680
google hangouts to communicate across

361
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,399
the organizations had increased

362
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,160
significantly so we found similar boost

363
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,480
for instant communication and measuring

364
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,480
messaging tools like slack

365
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,800
cloud storage solutions to manage data

366
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,720
securely and vpn services to keep

367
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,399
communications locked down

368
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,440
there are also gains for password

369
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:36,720
managers with 30.2 percent claiming they

370
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,279
use them more or rather slightly more

371
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,040
than they used to and 19.8 percent using

372
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,760
them significantly more

373
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,360
and so while number while these numbers

374
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,480
overall just kind of sound low it's

375
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,800
worth noting that

376
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,760
any increase in key areas of business

377
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,599
security is

378
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,760
is a good thing even in cases where

379
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,720
businesses said their use had slightly

380
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,040
increased

381
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,839
so for example 37.1 percent of

382
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,199
respondents

383
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:04,560
confirmed a small rise for vpn usage

384
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:07,279
with 40.6 replying in kind for tools

385
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,279
such as slack

386
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,399
and you know for some tools and services

387
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,639
there there wasn't much difference

388
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,959
between how respondents were using them

389
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,600
after lockdown versus before in fact

390
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:22,000
both cloud storage and cloud access

391
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,760
were used with the same frequency with

392
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,680
no visible increase

393
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,079
identity management even such as like

394
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,319
one logon or octa

395
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,560
was particularly particularly unique in

396
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,480
that precisely 36.1

397
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,518
they said they use these tools the same

398
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,519
as before while another 36.1 percent

399
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,839
said they used them a little bit more

400
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,519
than they did pre-pandemic so all this

401
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,120
data suggests that work environments

402
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,639
that were already secure

403
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,279
and making good use of security and

404
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,279
privacy tools had a reasonably smooth

405
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,639
transition to working from home

406
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,399
even if the organization wasn't

407
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,440
previously aware that it was possible to

408
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,360
do that

409
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,360
so more successful and well thought out

410
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,680
security policies and practices

411
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,519
didn't ultimately ultimately need a huge

412
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,479
amount of change to become coven 19

413
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,160
resilient

414
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,760
and you know a good a good example of

415
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,839
this uh just to

416
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,000
kind of toot our own horn was

417
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,399
malwarebytes

418
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,519
been with powerbytes for uh for over

419
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,800
eight years

420
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,399
uh and in the industry for over 16 and

421
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,240
for the majority of my time at maura

422
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,240
bytes i've worked remote

423
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,079
a lot of our research organizations are

424
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,959
remote we got a lot of sales people that

425
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,479
are remote

426
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,079
uh support people that are remote you

427
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,880
know to cover the different

428
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,800
uh time zones out there the different

429
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,759
areas and things like that

430
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,439
so from the get go we've been we've been

431
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,639
kind of learning how to do this remote

432
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,079
thing correctly we've

433
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,160
learned what the best communication

434
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,800
tools were we learned what the best you

435
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,279
know

436
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,040
way to stay in contact with people was

437
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,959
uh and overall i think we

438
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,560
when when the pandemic hit and we all

439
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,199
had to work from home suddenly i mean

440
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,119
those that

441
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,439
that weren't already doing it we've got

442
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,160
about four different offices worldwide

443
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,519
and a total of like 900 employees for

444
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,519
the entire company

445
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,560
and so we still had a lot of people that

446
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,040
had a switch

447
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,880
from in the office to working from home

448
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,959
but luckily we had all these tools set

449
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,880
up we had this framework in place

450
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,800
uh because of our existing remote

451
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,120
workers and that made the transition

452
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,920
really easy for us

453
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,360
at the same time even if you consider

454
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,000
and i'll talk about this later but even

455
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,079
if you if you consider the value

456
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,079
of making sure that an employee who is

457
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,279
remote like at a conference or at a

458
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,040
training or

459
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,959
somewhere else that they can't be in the

460
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,199
office you know you want to make their

461
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,599
ability to access your resources

462
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,839
you know very secure and not just a

463
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,920
potential vulnerability for attackers to

464
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,600
take advantage of

465
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,000
so there's lots of lots of benefits to

466
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,000
doing that

467
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,000
so our survey found that 23.8 percent of

468
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,560
the respondents ran into

469
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,079
unexpected expenses and specifically to

470
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,279
address a cyber security breach or

471
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,359
malware attack

472
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,040
nearly 20 percent stated they face a

473
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,920
security breach because of a remote

474
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,599
worker

475
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,519
so let's briefly put that statistic into

476
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,280
perspective remember that all it takes

477
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,599
for a company to suffer a security

478
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,918
breach as a result of a remote workforce

479
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,119
is to compromise just one remote

480
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,360
employee

481
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,639
as our survey showed a remarkable 98

482
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,240
percent of respondents said that

483
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,640
organizations have moved

484
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,079
at least 21 of their employees into a

485
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,919
remote positions

486
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,678
uh further the remaining two percent of

487
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,360
respondents said the organizations moved

488
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,480
anywhere from zero to twenty percent of

489
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,719
their workforces

490
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,400
into remote positions so with these

491
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,760
numbers it's safe to assume

492
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,320
that nearly every company out there

493
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,080
today has at least one remote employee

494
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,399
and thus is vulnerable to this type of

495
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,399
threat

496
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,520
i told you we were going to talk about

497
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,480
personal devices so

498
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:53,360
31 of our respondents admitted that they

499
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,320
sometimes used personal devices for work

500
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,760
and the frightening 27.7 said they used

501
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,918
their personal devices

502
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,919
more than the devices issued to them by

503
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:05,280
their employer

504
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,160
worse 8.4 never even received the work

505
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,399
issue device

506
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,480
for remote usage so because of all that

507
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,160
only 39.1 percent told us that they

508
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,520
adhere to a strict regime

509
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,200
of only using worker issued devices for

510
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,400
their workload

511
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,240
and i'm sure this is something that a

512
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,840
lot of you out there right now are

513
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,280
probably dealing with as well

514
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,799
where you might have uh a work issued

515
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,960
laptop or they say

516
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,000
you this is how you log into our vpn or

517
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,240
this is how you

518
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,160
access your corporate email this is how

519
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,600
you get into the cloud storage

520
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,200
um and if these if these processes of

521
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,719
accessing this information working with

522
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,200
the information aren't

523
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,240
uh fine-tuned well enough to at least

524
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,480
make it

525
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,480
you know not seem too different from the

526
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,080
office environment experience

527
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,480
uh then you can get work done but

528
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,439
unfortunately you know a lot of times we

529
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,760
see folks

530
00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:00,000
um you know not uh

531
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,600
not able to do that because of technical

532
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,120
difficulties you know they might not

533
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,760
have an it staff

534
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,439
that's uh readily available or or able

535
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,720
to help them with home

536
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,559
i.t issues you know uh look like for

537
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,280
another example from our bites uh the

538
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:17,120
other day it was a few weeks back i had

539
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,960
an issue with my laptop my work issued

540
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,239
laptop where suddenly it just would not

541
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,919
connect to the wi-fi and i know there

542
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,280
was an issue that went around

543
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,640
some people have mentioned it um

544
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,399
yeah i just could not connect to my home

545
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,600
wi-fi my personal device is connected

546
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,200
fine everything else in my house

547
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,000
connected fine but the work laptop just

548
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,760
wouldn't do it

549
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,039
and so i reached out to it luckily we

550
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,760
have a help desk system

551
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,960
you know already set up uh we utilize

552
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,840
you know single sign-on for

553
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,240
authentication

554
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,918
capabilities and whatnot and i was lucky

555
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,440
that rit staff said hey i already know

556
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,120
about this problem we wrote some scripts

557
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,840
we had some batch files here let me send

558
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,399
them to you

559
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,000
did that reset you know various aspects

560
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,840
of the network configuration and the

561
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,360
thing worked again so fantastic

562
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,120
now i'm very lucky that worked out for

563
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,240
me but let's say that it had let's say

564
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,239
that i couldn't

565
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,159
reach my it staff let's say that the

566
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,840
ticket that i submitted just sat on

567
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,360
you know sat in the queue forever

568
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,240
because it was a low priority or

569
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,799
something

570
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,840
or uh or maybe rit folks were dealing

571
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,080
with something far worse

572
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,959
you know something far more serious in

573
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,320
which case

574
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,080
i couldn't connect to the internet with

575
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,039
my work laptop so how am i supposed to

576
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,039
do my work

577
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,879
without using my work laptop my only

578
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,679
choice would be to either not do work at

579
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,559
all

580
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,679
uh which i don't think anybody wants or

581
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,158
use my own personal

582
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,799
device which is you know probably less

583
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,480
secure

584
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,600
so what people what are my choices here

585
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,840
and this is the kind of stuff people

586
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,840
have to worry about and plan for

587
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,559
so as we know uh the effects of working

588
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,678
from home and the coronavirus pandemic

589
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,000
extend beyond

590
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,520
cyber security impacts companies have

591
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,440
also suffered broad

592
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,280
financial losses over half of the

593
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,440
respondents said that they froze all

594
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,799
hiring or only made a few exceptions for

595
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,520
critical positions

596
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,960
this makes sense with short-term future

597
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,960
excuse me with the short-term future of

598
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,520
an organization in limbo you do not want

599
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,600
to make

600
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,960
long-term commitments except when the

601
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,000
position is critical to your

602
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,000
organization's needs

603
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,320
so 48 restricted travel expenses which

604
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,760
was not hard to do with the

605
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,639
international travel ban

606
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,000
and uh so that you know made it easy

607
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,640
over a third of our respondents

608
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,440
held off promotions and pay raises which

609
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,600
is a

610
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,480
logical consequence of short-term

611
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,480
insecurity

612
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,640
if the company comes out of the crisis

613
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,640
unhurt it's easy enough to make raises

614
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,360
retroactively effective

615
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,880
and 30.7 stated that they had to let

616
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,799
people go which is an unfortunate

617
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,640
consequence of lost business

618
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,158
and almost a quarter of respondents lost

619
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,679
clients and contracts

620
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,760
so these numbers show that for the rest

621
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,799
of 2020 several companies may be

622
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,440
operating in a crouched careful position

623
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,639
with fewer resources and fewer dollars

624
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,240
to rely on

625
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,080
while that data may imply that actual

626
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,760
workforce is powering these companies

627
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:59,600
will similarly suffer

628
00:21:53,760 --> 00:22:02,799
the data strangely shows the opposite

629
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,280
so let's talk about security hubris any

630
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,960
data

631
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,559
particularly data that points to

632
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,039
conflicting conclusions

633
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,879
demands scrutiny and that's just what we

634
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,600
did when working when looking at some of

635
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,559
the more

636
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,480
contradictory results in our survey as

637
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,480
we stated earlier 73 percent of

638
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,840
respondents scored their organization a

639
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,440
7 out of 10 or higher

640
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,199
when evaluating their readiness to

641
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,000
transition to work from home

642
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,679
this was a promising result as it showed

643
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,679
confidence on the part of the it

644
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,559
managers directors and executives to

645
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,240
maintain

646
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,480
the productivity performance and

647
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,240
security of their employees

648
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,080
but in looking at how respondents

649
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,960
specifically evaluated the security

650
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,080
posture

651
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,919
during the work from home aspect we must

652
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,360
consider a hidden modifier and that is

653
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,039
security hubris

654
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,799
the fact remains the transitioning to a

655
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,120
work from home model in the way

656
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,158
many organizations were forced to do

657
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,000
immediately

658
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,840
with more devices more software

659
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,799
deployments and limited in-person

660
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,439
support

661
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:02,080
has already created opportunities for

662
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,080
more attacks

663
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,280
so security hubris makes us believe that

664
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,440
since

665
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,280
we are secured in one way then we're

666
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,200
secured in all ways

667
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,039
for example who cares about passwords

668
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,760
when you care when you're careful about

669
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,679
what you post

670
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,360
on facebook and that's a terrible

671
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,840
terrible example but

672
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,320
basically blind faith is anything

673
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,559
anything is dangerous even if the tools

674
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,320
that you put your faith into keep you

675
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,240
secure have drawbacks

676
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,000
so take for example a network admin who

677
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,760
deploys network security tools to keep

678
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,760
attackers from breaching the network

679
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,919
through outward connected servers

680
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,520
assuming that their new security control

681
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,159
is good enough to keep the whole network

682
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,918
safe

683
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,679
but failing to protect individual

684
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,320
endpoints the criminals may use to

685
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,320
attack

686
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,240
via spear phishing it's that over

687
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,240
reliance in that one aspect

688
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,559
of security assuming hey since i'm so

689
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,240
strongly protected in this one area

690
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,559
i don't need to worry as much about the

691
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,679
rest unfortunately that's what

692
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:59,440
the bad guys expect us to do and that's

693
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,159
why they often look for

694
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,960
alternate methods of gaining access into

695
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,880
networks

696
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,760
uh through methods that maybe we had

697
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,760
never considered before

698
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,000
so despite this truth we asked

699
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,439
respondents how was your organization's

700
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,600
level of security

701
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,480
change in the transition to working from

702
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,559
home

703
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,480
we learned that many that many managers

704
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,000
directors and executives responded as

705
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,000
though nothing had changed

706
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,760
our top response was we're equally

707
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,120
secure as we were in the office

708
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,360
however it's more likely that home

709
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,959
network configurations are less secure

710
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,120
than the connection they would be using

711
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,960
in the office we've seen cyber security

712
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,479
attacks that rely specifically on this

713
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,360
type of human error

714
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,159
the miraibotnet had repeatedly scanned

715
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,559
cyberspace

716
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,240
for internet of things devices that are

717
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,960
still operating with default login

718
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,799
credentials

719
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,159
that came out of the box using those

720
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,080
credentials to take control of the

721
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,279
device and trigger ddos attacks and yes

722
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,240
i said cyberspace

723
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:58,080
i love the word cyberspace we cannot

724
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,520
assume that every remote employee has

725
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,559
changed the default password on their

726
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,879
home router yet

727
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:05,360
the the responses uh showed that

728
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,360
organizations are equally secure

729
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,799
and so they they basically assume the

730
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,639
opposite

731
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,559
uh the second most common response was

732
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,440
we're slightly less secure than we were

733
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,879
in the office

734
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:19,440
coming at 26.7 percent this answer is

735
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,799
likely the most accurate when applied

736
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,760
broadly to the postcode

737
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,520
work environment simply put employees

738
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,080
likely aren't as secure as they were in

739
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,279
an office

740
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,199
because they don't have a dedicated

741
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,960
security team to lock down their home

742
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,360
routers or smart devices

743
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,840
these unsecured assets offer an avenue

744
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,600
of entry into home and work networks

745
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,639
and allow for possible hijacking of

746
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,879
company systems or resources

747
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,720
so next if we combine the the responses

748
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,960
that favor at home security

749
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,159
over that in the office we see that more

750
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,320
than 35 percent

751
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,760
of survey participants are potentially

752
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,279
overconfident

753
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,320
we're significantly more secure than we

754
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:58,960
were in the office received 18.3 percent

755
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,158
and were signific slightly more secure

756
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,360
than we were in the office

757
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,039
garnered 16.8 percent so we have to

758
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,000
consider a separate possibility here

759
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,480
that perhaps

760
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,720
office networks were woefully under

761
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,640
secured to begin with and efforts made

762
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,840
to improve the baseline when moving to

763
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,760
work from home

764
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,360
uh you know efforts were made however if

765
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,679
that wasn't the case

766
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,760
this could be another indicator of more

767
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,650
security hubris so let's say that your

768
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,120
your it guy

769
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:27,520
[Music]

770
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,439
you know can't get the funding to

771
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,200
properly roll out security

772
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,039
for the work network in the office or

773
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,640
whatever but they

774
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,158
you know spend their own money on

775
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,000
security for their home network so in

776
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:42,880
that case yeah i guess they probably are

777
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,880
more secure that's a reach

778
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,080
so perhaps i.t leaders believe that

779
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,440
security though because

780
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,000
they are physically distant from the

781
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,919
networks or offices their security is no

782
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,080
longer centralized and that means it's

783
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,559
less likely for attackers to target them

784
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,678
or perhaps they feel more secure because

785
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,279
they are in control of their own

786
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,360
security like i said

787
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,640
versus trusting someone else these are

788
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,479
assumptions we could all make

789
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,679
and we don't blame anyone for coming to

790
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,919
those conclusions

791
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,039
but whether it be a vpn connection onto

792
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,880
the corporate network

793
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,240
corporate email accounts or access to

794
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,080
cloud-based services

795
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,080
most employees need to access their

796
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,080
company's resources remotely

797
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,918
if an attacker is able to identify key

798
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,240
information about a target such as

799
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,679
email address or social media account

800
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,440
they may have an easier time

801
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,760
infiltrating a personal network than a

802
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,760
corporate one that individual compromise

803
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,919
can then be used as a springboard

804
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,200
to greater corporate access and in fact

805
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,480
a lot of the threats we saw over the

806
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,799
first half of the year were

807
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,799
remote access trojans information

808
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,520
stealers stuff meant to kind of scope

809
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,080
out

810
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,679
uh what applications people were using

811
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,799
how their connections to their business

812
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:51,520
you know resources were things like that

813
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,120
you know to help identify possible

814
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,399
avenues for infection

815
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,399
using those remote employees

816
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,000
so the final response the one that

817
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,640
received the fewest votes

818
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,240
uh was were significantly less secure

819
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,640
than we were in the office which came

820
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,279
down

821
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:11,120
in at 6.9 despite its slow ranking

822
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,880
we believe this should be the

823
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,559
expectation this should be the

824
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,120
expectation when companies initially

825
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,360
move

826
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,479
to a remote workforce security will

827
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,799
likely be subpar

828
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,760
in comparison to what it was in an

829
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,399
office setting

830
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,320
if it leaders work from that assumption

831
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,918
they'll likely avoid making mistakes or

832
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,080
ignoring issues that could leave their

833
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,919
organizations vulnerable

834
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,760
so most businesses will experience a

835
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,080
drop in their ability to protect systems

836
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,039
in the initial rollout to a fully remote

837
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,720
workforce

838
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,399
once new systems and tools have been

839
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,279
established configured and deployed

840
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,279
correctly

841
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,960
users will be as secure or maybe even

842
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,919
more secure than when they were working

843
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,520
in the office

844
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,960
but that's that's really a finish line

845
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,120
that a lot of organizations may never

846
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,120
see

847
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,199
so let's talk about next steps

848
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,039
so we asked our respondents what kind of

849
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,640
long-term changes

850
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,120
will the recent transition to working

851
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,799
from home have on your organization

852
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,799
and we were able to determine the top

853
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,918
efforts being made to empower employees

854
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,320
and optimize

855
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,320
work from home security the most popular

856
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,000
response was to develop stronger remote

857
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,320
security policies

858
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,799
we agree with response respondents here

859
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,240
and as stronger remote security policies

860
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,879
are important for not only

861
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,000
long term security strategy but also

862
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,720
unified execution

863
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,640
across the organizations moving forward

864
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,240
the goal is to deploy remote work

865
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,840
security guidance that views the

866
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,640
organization from an attacker's

867
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,439
standpoint

868
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,960
so make sure you are creative a close

869
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,799
second at 54

870
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,799
was to install a permanent work from

871
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,480
home model for employees who don't need

872
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,760
to be in the office every day

873
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,600
you know i think i read yesterday that

874
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,039
said that twitter is just going to go

875
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,279
work from home forever like their

876
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:54,320
employees have that option forever

877
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:56,159
i'm not sure that's true or not but

878
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,678
you know this this response makes it

879
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,360
possible to accommodate not only

880
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,399
permanent work from home strategies but

881
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,399
also security

882
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:04,320
that benefits workers and as i mentioned

883
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,840
before these workers who might be out of

884
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,559
the office on a business trip or

885
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,279
vacation

886
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:12,320
they need to access company resources so

887
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:14,240
you're going to need the stuff anyway

888
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,439
mirroring it leaders concerns that their

889
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,320
employees needed more

890
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,880
security training 48.9 of respondents

891
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,879
wanted to

892
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,520
quote host more trainings for work from

893
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,039
home training is important for remote

894
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,440
employees however it can only be

895
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,679
valuable if it's tailored to individual

896
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,600
to the individual or team or department

897
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,120
needs and responsibilities like i said

898
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,799
you know i've been working remote for a

899
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,918
very very long time

900
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:40,399
and i've seen policies rolled out

901
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,840
that that seem to make sense to people

902
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,678
in the office but doesn't really make

903
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,279
sense to people who are working remote

904
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,159
or it might only make sense to have the

905
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,159
people working remote

906
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,360
you know a blanket security policy and

907
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,399
generic security training will only take

908
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,000
organizations so far uh plus workers who

909
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,639
have to pay better attention of security

910
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,720
advice

911
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,399
is specific and relevant what i mean by

912
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,039
that is basically if you've got an it

913
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:05,439
team

914
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,120
that can that can take the time to work

915
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,120
with individual employees

916
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,639
and say okay what's your home set up

917
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,000
here what kind of you know have you have

918
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,120
you changed the default passwords on

919
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,559
your router are you

920
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,080
you know running the latest versions of

921
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,600
whatever do you have any clear and

922
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,039
obvious vulnerabilities

923
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,678
i think these things that can really

924
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:24,320
only be a five or ten minute assessment

925
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,960
for most folks would benefit a lot of

926
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,559
people

927
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,480
uh immensely because they don't feel

928
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:31,200
like all right i'm supposed to

929
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,880
you know comply with this this guidance

930
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,679
that maybe half of it isn't relevant to

931
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,320
what i'm doing

932
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,159
you know that's an issue so in an effort

933
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,000
to see how well it teams are testing new

934
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,000
work from home technologies we asked

935
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,279
respondents if they plan on developing

936
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,320
online privacy reviews for new software

937
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,840
six percent replied yeah uh an it or

938
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,639
security team that's deploying work from

939
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,879
home tools

940
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,880
needs to make sure that those tools both

941
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,279
function and keep communication

942
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,120
information secure sometimes new

943
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,080
features are added to these tools that

944
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,158
might change how

945
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,158
the con how they are configured so

946
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,440
conducting regular privacy and security

947
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,399
audits on these technologies

948
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,480
keep companies and employees safer and

949
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:12,000
finally at 39.6 percent of surveyed

950
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,360
participants said that they would deploy

951
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,840
any virus solutions

952
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,840
it can better handle a remote workforce

953
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,279
so many of the threats that we

954
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,879
have seen targeting work from home

955
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,919
employees over the first couple quarters

956
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,080
of 2020

957
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,760
are older commercial threats this means

958
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,000
that using an antivirus solution on

959
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,399
users home and remote work systems is

960
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,880
probably one of the best things and

961
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:34,559
easiest ways to secure

962
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,799
these systems against types of threats

963
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:38,720
that we're currently seeing in the wild

964
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,240
it's important though that to keep in

965
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,519
mind that solution you decide to use

966
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,200
should be easy to deploy

967
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,200
run updates run scans and monitor

968
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,399
detections from anywhere your employees

969
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,080
might be located

970
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:50,959
something that is more important now

971
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,960
than ever before

972
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,720
so the last bit of security guidance we

973
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,879
want to provide

974
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,039
will not only protect users from real

975
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,279
world cyber threats in the wild but

976
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,879
uh but also maintain productivity first

977
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,000
of course deploy security tools

978
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,080
i already kind of mentioned this

979
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,360
previously um

980
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,519
you know try to find a solution that

981
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,240
also works with mobile we're seeing more

982
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,240
and more

983
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,440
cyber criminals and cyber gang you know

984
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,240
cyber crime groups

985
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,080
uh attempting to compromise uh devices

986
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,799
you know mobile devices android ios

987
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,279
whatever

988
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,480
mainly to help defeat multi-factor

989
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,880
authentication which is something that

990
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,720
we

991
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:29,360
heavily push on people is a good idea

992
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,080
so next utilizing a vpn is a bit of a

993
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,559
no-brainer

994
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,639
if your employees need to access secure

995
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:38,080
data located on a local

996
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,919
protected network rather than

997
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,480
making valuable data available to the

998
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,880
world utilizing vpns with multi-factor

999
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,880
authentication is a much better solution

1000
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,919
be sure to keep in mind ease of use when

1001
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,399
it comes to

1002
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,080
which vpn solution you choose to employ

1003
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,080
if a user has too much difficulty

1004
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,960
logging into the vpn that can result in

1005
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,960
multiple out

1006
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,320
unfortunate outcomes like i mentioned

1007
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,320
before uh

1008
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,320
if if the technology you provide your

1009
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,279
employees doesn't work to help them do

1010
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,480
their work

1011
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,600
then they're going to find something

1012
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,600
else to use you know they're going to

1013
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,118
find some other way to do it

1014
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,960
the first example that i that i

1015
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,280
mentioned before talking about

1016
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,320
uh you know there was an error with the

1017
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,720
the computer

1018
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,359
uh with a laptop and then i got iot to

1019
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,678
fix it

1020
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,639
but this example talks about how even if

1021
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,800
the the

1022
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,879
process for connecting to your vpn is

1023
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,440
too convoluted and difficult for

1024
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,078
maybe a non-technical employee they may

1025
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,359
also

1026
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,200
say you know i'm not going to use that

1027
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:34,239
at all it's too confusing for me

1028
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,719
um and in you know vpn connections can

1029
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,040
be

1030
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:38,719
can be very confusing especially when

1031
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,440
you've got things like you know

1032
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:43,199
uh domain passwords to worry about

1033
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,560
multi-factor authentication things to

1034
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,960
worry about you know there's

1035
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,078
lots of stuff like that but you know

1036
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,639
there are lots of options

1037
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,240
out there and i'm sure every person can

1038
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,480
find a vpn solution that fits their

1039
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:58,479
organization best

1040
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,079
um so here's an example

1041
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,000
an employee just started working remote

1042
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,280
and needs to access some data from a

1043
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,720
corporate database

1044
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,720
they were informed that they need to use

1045
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,160
a vpn to access that kind of data

1046
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,598
however the process of installing

1047
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,839
configuring logging in

1048
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,800
etc it becomes you know too much for the

1049
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,000
employee to handle

1050
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,200
they end up spending a lot of time

1051
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,240
trying to use the software without

1052
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,919
success

1053
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,279
in this instance the employee is using

1054
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,720
productivity because of technical

1055
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,200
difficulties your it

1056
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,480
teams will need to address this problem

1057
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,399
and walk the user through

1058
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,079
configuring the vpn which could take

1059
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,680
them away from other tasks

1060
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,400
and considering that a large chunk of

1061
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,319
the employee base is working remote

1062
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,680
the it staff probably have more tickets

1063
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,359
than they know what to do with

1064
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,279
so the final outcome would be that the

1065
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,880
employee ends up not using their own

1066
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,320
their work issue device to connect to

1067
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,720
the database or they would

1068
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,000
find some less secure work around

1069
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,598
regardless it degrades the

1070
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,720
organization's security posture

1071
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:54,320
so point is try to keep it simple and

1072
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:56,240
finally communication is key to not only

1073
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,079
keeping employees aware of policies and

1074
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:01,040
reporting potential threats

1075
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,800
but also to maintain productivity morale

1076
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,400
and create a framework of support for

1077
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,320
your remote employees

1078
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,480
in a regular office an employee may be

1079
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,880
given a task and if some details of the

1080
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,960
task

1081
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,119
isn't clear or the employee just needs

1082
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,680
more info it's easy enough to reach out

1083
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,000
to a

1084
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,598
fellow employee nearby or their boss or

1085
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,599
you know whomever

1086
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,359
but when working remote especially if an

1087
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,240
employee has been working remote for a

1088
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,839
while

1089
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,319
reaching out to the boss or fellow

1090
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:29,200
employees isn't as easy as it once was

1091
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:31,440
for a number of reasons so maintaining

1092
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,359
not just the technology but a culture of

1093
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,880
communication for your remote folks

1094
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,880
should always be a high priority

1095
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,119
so let's wrap this up folks

1096
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,320
frustratingly some of the very decisions

1097
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,640
that companies have made

1098
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,640
to better support their employees to

1099
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,759
provide more software tools to provide

1100
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,440
more devices

1101
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,599
are the same types of decisions that can

1102
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,599
lead to a broader attack surface

1103
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,119
further with the majority of workforces

1104
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,720
now working remotely

1105
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,480
it is once again only human that only

1106
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,560
some employers that some employers will

1107
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,160
begin to use their personal devices

1108
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,400
more and more frequently in completing

1109
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,920
their work despite the conditions many

1110
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,920
companies have created which threat

1111
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,480
actors are now trying to take advantage

1112
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,079
of

1113
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,920
these decisions were largely made to

1114
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,200
support the safety and security of

1115
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,880
employees

1116
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,078
in the coming months several forward

1117
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,119
thinking decisions can help

1118
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,440
organizations

1119
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,520
fully realize their goal of a remote

1120
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,520
workforce that is equally as secure

1121
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,599
or even more secure than the previous

1122
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,520
office environment

1123
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,960
so for the security of your business and

1124
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,720
your employees you should consider

1125
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,800
deploying an antivirus solution

1126
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,078
that can manage now dispersed endpoints

1127
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,000
in your workforce

1128
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,119
many popular forms of malware today also

1129
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,960
happen to be older

1130
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,560
these are known recorded threats and a

1131
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,920
strong cyber security solution should be

1132
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,920
more than able to detect

1133
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,680
and remove these threats or better yet

1134
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,760
protect against and defend your business

1135
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,919
before they have a chance to take hold

1136
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,920
as far as more modern threats go we are

1137
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,440
seeing a resurgence and things like

1138
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,440
uh emitteth we're seeing new

1139
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,960
developments and and evolutions of

1140
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,720
families like trickbot

1141
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,000
there's been a lot of manual ransomware

1142
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,399
attacks recently

1143
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,160
so the the landscape is changing right

1144
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,200
now uh drastically

1145
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:08,319
and um we're not even entirely sure what

1146
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,040
it's going to look like at the end of

1147
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,760
the year

1148
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,359
so you know keep that in mind and and

1149
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,560
make sure to roll out technology or

1150
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:17,680
solutions that

1151
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:20,000
that have that kind of flexibility

1152
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,359
finally our survey also revealed that

1153
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,560
nearly half of all respondents are

1154
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,160
considering various

1155
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,680
cyber security measures in the coming

1156
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,160
months although that includes

1157
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,759
developing stronger remote security or

1158
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,480
installing a permanent work from home

1159
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,079
model

1160
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,599
we're more than halfway through the year

1161
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,960
now and it's

1162
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,200
time that the other half of companies

1163
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,440
rise up the tools are out there

1164
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,879
and they are smart they're they're smart

1165
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,320
and secure ways to do this so let's go

1166
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,920
ahead and do it

1167
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,920
that's it for me folks if you have any

1168
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:50,160
questions please uh please put them
