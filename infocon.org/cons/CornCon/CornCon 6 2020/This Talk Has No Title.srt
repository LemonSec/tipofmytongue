1
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,680
good afternoon

2
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:29,840
welcome to corncon 6.

3
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,599
wow it's 2020 and i was told today that

4
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,559
it's october already

5
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,440
um our next speaker is uh dr gene

6
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,519
spafford

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,920
professor at purdue university i've

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:44,480
known spaff for a long time

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,320
um he's his talk has no title

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,239
uh but it's going to be a great talk we

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,320
have we have a good audience here

12
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,239
and uh we're recording this for

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,879
posterity it'll be up on our youtube

14
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,800
here

15
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,800
in the next day or two um

16
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,640
let's see i think that's about itspaf

17
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,879
i'll let you

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,119
take over here all right well hello

19
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,399
everyone i'm going to try and share my

20
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:11,680
screen

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:16,000
and see how this works

22
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:19,200
so i've got

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,320
a screen shared

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,320
do you see my

25
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,560
i i see the screen i also see the

26
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,159
previews on the left

27
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,159
all right well that's not quite right

28
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,920
you have the right screen now i i do see

29
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,280
it it's a little bit small but

30
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,200
it's it's very legible okay so

31
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,439
uh you don't have two slides up on the

32
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,720
screen just one

33
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,279
i just see one excellent

34
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,720
well we have a comment earlier we had a

35
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,520
speaker the slides were a little bit

36
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,720
small

37
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,200
and the answer was if you go up to the

38
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,759
top

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,759
there's a change screen

40
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:08,399
is there an option for that i'm looking

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:12,080
left side upper above a timer

42
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:15,200
as i recall um

43
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,680
oh well i'm using keynote so

44
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,480
okay power well this is i think this is

45
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,599
fine

46
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,920
all right i can see the slide it's just

47
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,799
only a little bit small so go right

48
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,000
ahead sorry

49
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:32,560
all right well so hi everyone

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,360
um this talk doesn't have a title and

51
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,959
that is the title there's ambiguity

52
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,400
there and that's actually part of what

53
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,440
i'm talking about

54
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,200
is ambiguity and the purpose of this

55
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,560
talk

56
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,839
um so i'll just start off by saying

57
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,040
this is also interspersed with the

58
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,599
number of quotes that i find appropriate

59
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,359
and i think some of you may as well

60
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,280
sometimes i wonder if i'm in my right

61
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,000
mind and then it passes off

62
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,200
and i'm as intelligent as ever and

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,400
that's basically what this is about

64
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,079
um what i want to do is start off and

65
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,200
say in computing

66
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,120
software engineering which you've and

67
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,480
well i won't say undoubtedly but perhaps

68
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,640
i've heard about

69
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,440
is a building systems that do what you

70
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,440
want them to do

71
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,840
safety engineering is another area of

72
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,679
computing

73
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,239
and that's building systems that don't

74
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,599
do things you don't want them to do

75
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,239
like fail catastrophically security

76
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,238
engineering

77
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,239
is building systems that only do what

78
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,920
you want them to do

79
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,920
that's the hardest of the three

80
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,440
because you not only have to make them

81
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,959
do what you want to do

82
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,720
but you want to make sure they don't do

83
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:53,040
things you don't want them to do

84
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,040
so it has to be correct and safe

85
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,879
part of what we do in cyber security is

86
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,839
try to think in ways that

87
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,959
system designers have not anticipated if

88
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,159
we're not the system

89
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,599
designers that is and

90
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,399
try to apply some out of the box

91
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,640
thinking to get some new insights

92
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,480
into science and engineering both in how

93
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,279
to build systems

94
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,760
and if our job is to look for flaws in

95
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,000
them

96
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,279
find out how they're misconfigured also

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,240
to do that

98
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,919
and so uh by trying to think outside the

99
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,120
box think in ways that the designers

100
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,719
didn't intend

101
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,720
we may be able to find some flaws or

102
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,720
misconfigurations

103
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,919
so what follows are some examples i use

104
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,479
in classes

105
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,120
some of my classes at the university to

106
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,159
illustrate

107
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,919
some ways of thinking to help you sort

108
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,680
of get in this mindset

109
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:49,039
and along with some lessons that may or

110
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,759
may not be

111
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,759
useful to you

112
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,000
i would say try to solve these if you

113
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,120
have some

114
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,120
paper and pencils or pens or crayons

115
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,039
an inkwell with a feather whatever it

116
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,680
may be

117
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,639
you can try to solve some of these as we

118
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,240
go along

119
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,919
otherwise try to work them out in your

120
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,199
head

121
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:17,919
so when you get a solution don't

122
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,039
post it on it on the chat if you've got

123
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,960
video if you've got

124
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,560
if you've got audio on yours don't don't

125
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,400
yell it out

126
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,320
give others an opportunity to try to

127
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,679
think through the solution and i'll give

128
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,919
the solution to these

129
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,600
as we go along i'm just not going to

130
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,880
give you a very long time for each of

131
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,199
them

132
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:40,240
okay so let's start

133
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:43,520
with a diagram and we're going to have

134
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,720
four questions related to this diagram

135
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,840
with this square

136
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,560
and it's actually seven

137
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,280
squares if you look at it in that way

138
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,600
where a b

139
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,280
c and d are each a square and then each

140
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,039
of the little black sections inside is

141
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,880
also a square

142
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,120
so let's get that out of the way they're

143
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,199
actually squares

144
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,800
so i'm going to ask you four questions

145
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,400
related to this

146
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,919
and let's see how you do so the first

147
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,919
question

148
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,240
is divide the white area in square a

149
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,120
that is the upper right quadrant into

150
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,120
two equal pieces

151
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,159
now this should be pretty easy you can

152
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,600
do this in your head you don't have to

153
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,440
write this down

154
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,840
dividing the white area into two equal

155
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,840
pieces

156
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:34,080
equal equivalent same that's going to be

157
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,560
the meaning in each of the following

158
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,599
problems

159
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,600
how do you do it there's the answer it's

160
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,160
fairly straightforward

161
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,560
each of those diagonals as each of the

162
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,919
parts separated by the diagonal

163
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,759
is a mirror image of the other one

164
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,359
okay let's move on to one that's a

165
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,639
little harder

166
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,120
that's in b divided into three equal

167
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,160
pieces

168
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,520
this is a little bit more difficult

169
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,280
still it's not too difficult and again

170
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,198
if you think about it for a moment you

171
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,758
should be able to get this

172
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,080
visualized in your in your mind or if

173
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,280
you scratch it out

174
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,159
very quickly on on paper or canvas or

175
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,159
the desk or

176
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,280
somebody sitting next to you you'll be

177
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,280
able to come up with a solution

178
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,119
and there it is basically just extending

179
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,880
to the sides of that inner

180
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:36,319
square and now we have three squares

181
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:39,120
in the white area in area b

182
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,639
okay so this gives you the idea now

183
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,840
let's move

184
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,840
to a harder one

185
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:53,120
divide the area c into

186
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,120
four equal pieces

187
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:01,039
this is difficult this is not simple

188
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,440
i've had people get it you can think

189
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,440
about it

190
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,280
and what i'll do is i'll give you i'll

191
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,318
give you a little bit of time here to

192
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,679
think about this and

193
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,759
maybe sketch it out if you've got

194
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,000
something that you can work on to get an

195
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,759
idea

196
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,479
of what it would look like but remember

197
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:22,080
they have to be the same shape

198
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:27,840
same volume or same area in the solution

199
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,840
by drawing lines there

200
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,199
so a couple of you may have the answer

201
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,719
but because this one's hard i'm guessing

202
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,719
that probably

203
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,880
most of you don't but when you see the

204
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,880
solution you'll go oh yeah that works

205
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,000
each of those if you look at it same

206
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,680
shape

207
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,040
and same area

208
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,920
that was a little tough but people have

209
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,160
a good

210
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,839
understanding of geometry tend to get

211
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,680
that

212
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:09,519
okay so now that you've loosened up on

213
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:13,519
this we're going to ask the hardest one

214
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:18,000
okay we went two three

215
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:21,760
four and now we're gonna jump to seven

216
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
okay this is really tough although

217
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,560
people have a really good understanding

218
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,399
of geometry

219
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,399
and unusual shapes may get this

220
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,000
so i'm going to let you go for a couple

221
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,839
seconds and think about how you

222
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,839
do that

223
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,360
it's tough isn't it although i bet a few

224
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,040
of you have gotten it

225
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,560
i mean i don't know how many there are

226
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,240
out there watching this

227
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,680
but there's probably a couple who

228
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,680
thought about the answer

229
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,079
there you go it's really not that

230
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,360
difficult

231
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:10,239
but what's happened is that the way i

232
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,600
primed you with the questions for the

233
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,040
other three

234
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,959
and their solutions you probably weren't

235
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,959
thinking along these lines

236
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,640
so if you didn't get the answer don't

237
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,518
feel badly about that

238
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,040
that's actually what very often happens

239
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,680
when you get stuck in a rut thinking

240
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,680
about things

241
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:35,360
if you get in a mode where you think

242
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,760
the answer must look like a certain kind

243
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,800
of solution

244
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,120
then you may not find the actual answer

245
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,040
so conditioning is one of the things

246
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,760
that we have to overcome when we work in

247
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:51,439
security

248
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,519
let's do another one instead of geometry

249
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,440
we're going to move to something to see

250
00:10:53,519 --> 00:11:00,959
what your mastery is

251
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:04,560
of english language

252
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:06,479
here's a line of letters and what you

253
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,079
need to do is cross out six letters so

254
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,079
the remaining letters

255
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,120
without altering their sequence will

256
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:15,040
spell a familiar

257
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:18,320
english word so what i want to do

258
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:21,199
is i'll give you a whole minute

259
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,959
to look through this and try to think of

260
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,600
how you cross out six letters so the

261
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:29,839
remaining letters

262
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,839
will spell it from their english word

263
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:46,000
okay got 30 more seconds

264
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,560
i wish i had some way of knowing how

265
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,760
many of you

266
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:57,839
actually solved this or not i see

267
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:57,839
there's 35 people watching

268
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:14,079
all right we got 10 more seconds

269
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,079
there we go did you get the answer

270
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:27,600
you see there crossed out six letters

271
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,599
s i x l e t t e r s

272
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,200
and you get the word banana

273
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,639
here's another thing that's important

274
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,560
when we're working in security or

275
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,399
computing in general and that's being

276
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,638
alert to ambiguity

277
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,959
where something may have multiple

278
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,800
meanings

279
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:52,719
and i sort of like that quote by

280
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:55,279
sigmund freud there but ambiguity

281
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,399
pops up all the time in language because

282
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:01,040
words can have multiple meanings

283
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,880
just as they did in that problem and so

284
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,839
when we are reading a manual

285
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,760
or specifications or comments or user

286
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,600
instructions or even code

287
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,200
we should be alert to the fact that

288
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,279
there may be more than one meaning

289
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,680
in whatever it is we're reading or

290
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,680
watching

291
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:22,880
all right so we're going to go from

292
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:26,000
language to roman numerals

293
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,000
let's see how you do here

294
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,240
so the roman numeral x i

295
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,200
and i'm assuming most people know what

296
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,880
that means

297
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:40,160
x i is eleven that's ten plus one

298
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:43,360
so add a single line to that

299
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,360
to change it to twelve

300
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,160
and that's pretty straightforward you

301
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:51,920
just add another one

302
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:54,160
or another i is basically what that is

303
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,040
so that's how roman numerals work and i

304
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,920
think most people

305
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,920
can figure that out

306
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,079
so change xx to represent 19.

307
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,240
and i usually find that younger people

308
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,279
who've been exposed to this in school

309
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,560
um more recently tend to get this pretty

310
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,519
quickly

311
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,760
and you just put an i in between so it's

312
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,680
x

313
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,680
i x and that's 19.

314
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,199
so here's another one change i i to

315
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,800
represent nine

316
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:33,359
so it's basically changing two to

317
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,359
represent nine by adding a single line

318
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,800
now on this i'm limited somewhat by the

319
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,680
display the way that i

320
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,279
that i showed this but basically you put

321
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,760
a line through the second one to turn it

322
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:50,639
into an

323
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,639
x so you have i x and there's nine

324
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:58,320
if you got that congratulate yourself

325
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:01,440
and then we'll do one last simple one

326
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,800
to show how this works change

327
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:12,079
ix to represent six

328
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:14,719
single line

329
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,239
again this is one usually where younger

330
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,440
members of the audience often get this

331
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,560
before

332
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:24,160
older members of the audience

333
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,160
and i'm sure you've gotten it by now

334
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,480
you draw that single line and there you

335
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,479
have six

336
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,120
the lesson from this is don't assume

337
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:36,399
context

338
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,000
so the fact that we were talking roman

339
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,079
numerals

340
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,639
for the first three didn't mean that

341
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:46,959
they were all roman numerals

342
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:50,399
because all i did is say uh add one line

343
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:54,000
and it could be a curved line to get six

344
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,480
and that's what we did groucho marx one

345
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,839
of uh

346
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,680
the great philosophers of all time uh

347
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,079
has a quote for nearly everything and

348
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:05,199
particularly for this

349
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:08,319
so again don't assume context or don't

350
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:11,839
let previous examples constrain your

351
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,839
thinking for the current problem

352
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,959
here's one you may have seen before but

353
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,758
not everybody has seen it or remembers

354
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,239
it

355
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,279
we put nine dots down in a regular

356
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,199
pattern

357
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,800
and the goal is for you to draw five

358
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,959
straight lines without lifting your

359
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,599
pencil or pen or crayon or whatever it

360
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,680
is

361
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,199
from the paper so to go through each dot

362
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,439
exactly once

363
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,880
now this is a little harder to do if you

364
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,240
have to imagine it

365
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,680
and so if you don't have something to

366
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,360
draw with in front of you that's a

367
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,719
little harder

368
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,720
but try and imagine this

369
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:51,839
how you might do that for five lines and

370
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,839
nine dots

371
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,239
there's one

372
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,360
there's two

373
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,079
if you think about it you might be able

374
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,880
to come up with three more

375
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,520
that will take you through all the dots

376
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,079
and there's

377
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,359
actually several solutions this one

378
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,918
there's a third line

379
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,678
fourth line fifth line so you can draw

380
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,079
that all without taking

381
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,760
your your writing instrument up from

382
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,438
your surface

383
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,959
and you get five lines going through all

384
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,959
nine dots okay

385
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,400
a harder one is do the same thing with

386
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,960
four lines

387
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,480
and again i'm going to give you maybe 45

388
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,240
seconds here

389
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,960
if i was doing this in person i'd have a

390
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,240
better idea i'd be able to see you with

391
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,880
i uh paper pencil other kinds of things

392
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,120
to see how many of you got the solution

393
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,880
but we'll go for about another 30

394
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,959
seconds and let you

395
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,440
try this out if you've got some paper in

396
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,960
front of you

397
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,720
it's the same kind of problem it's just

398
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,280
one fewer line

399
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:03,919
which would seem easier

400
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,918
but it's not

401
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:17,200
all right so some of you may have the

402
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,200
solution

403
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,919
one two three

404
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:28,160
four see

405
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,919
four lines we never have to lift your

406
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,679
pencil or crayon or whatever it is from

407
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,160
the paper

408
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,640
the lesson from this is be sure you

409
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,440
understand the boundaries

410
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,440
when someone gives you a problem what's

411
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,200
part of it

412
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,799
what are the lines if you always have to

413
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,280
color within the lines

414
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:49,440
that may not give you all of the uh

415
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,840
solutions

416
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,840
that you might be able to uh actually

417
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,280
solve the problem or find this

418
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:01,039
find the solution and again

419
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:03,840
my favorite philosopher groucho marx

420
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,200
i've actually found that this problem is

421
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,879
solved again

422
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,039
more often by younger people

423
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,400
because they are less likely to feel

424
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,120
that they have to

425
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:18,320
follow the same within the lines

426
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,320
constrained solutions

427
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,799
how about a word problem

428
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,880
we'll start off with one here uh which

429
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,600
i'll read to you

430
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,440
nancy's parents were a very eccentric

431
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,918
physicist and a wacky electrical

432
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,919
engineer

433
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,559
we don't have any of those here right

434
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,760
john

435
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:44,799
um anyhow nancy's parents got married

436
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,640
uh in grad school so they they were both

437
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,879
in grad school learning things

438
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,640
and they had five children now because

439
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,080
they were eccentric

440
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,679
but they were very orderly i mean

441
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,159
physicists and other electrical

442
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:01,440
engineers tend to like order

443
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,600
so they named their children

444
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,360
the first children was nana the second

445
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,559
child was nay nay

446
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,678
third child was nini fourth child was no

447
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,960
no

448
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,960
what did they name their fifth child

449
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:21,039
if any of you said nunu

450
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,840
now what was nancy because nancy's

451
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,039
parents

452
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:27,600
were really she was the fifth child out

453
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,600
of five

454
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:34,559
patterns aren't rules and sometimes the

455
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,840
solution is given to you but because you

456
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,960
see the patterns

457
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,000
you assume that the solution or the next

458
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,600
in a sequence

459
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,400
must follow what came before it's really

460
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,158
important

461
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,760
that you don't lose track of what you've

462
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,679
already heard

463
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,600
and that you don't get into the belief

464
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:55,280
that simply because there's a pattern

465
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,280
that everything must match it

466
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,280
here's another one of those kind of word

467
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,120
puzzles

468
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,840
there's a terrible plane crash in the

469
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,840
andes mountains

470
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,640
that's in south america by the way news

471
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,320
reports from the scene stated

472
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,440
definitively that every single person

473
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:20,320
had died tragedy

474
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,159
authorities verified these reports a

475
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,799
week later 22 survivors met at a

476
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:28,960
memorial service

477
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:33,200
how can that be every single person died

478
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:36,000
and it was verified how could they meet

479
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:39,280
how's it possible and it's not simply

480
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,280
because it was in south america

481
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,799
it's because every single person had

482
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,640
died

483
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,639
all the married couples survived

484
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:56,399
again words matter

485
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,520
if there are adjectives or adverbs in

486
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,840
place

487
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:04,400
or case or other things in a description

488
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,840
in a requirement statement in a manual

489
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,600
entry

490
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:13,120
they matter and if you're doing security

491
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,799
you should read these carefully

492
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,520
make sure you understand what they mean

493
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:20,158
and how they apply

494
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:23,200
of course john von neumann great

495
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,200
computer scientist

496
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,879
was also a philosopher but part of what

497
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,400
he did

498
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,360
no use being precise about something

499
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,440
when you don't even know what you're

500
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,520
talking about

501
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,720
talking about the single people there no

502
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,120
single person

503
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,720
or no every single person died that's

504
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,320
being precise

505
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:47,039
it's just being precise in a way that

506
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,039
you may be uh ignoring

507
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:53,600
here's a little computer program

508
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,799
and this is written in well c c plus

509
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,158
plus

510
00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:00,000
um and um

511
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,000
i realize not everybody in the audience

512
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,159
is familiar with that language

513
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,480
but it's just a little short section of

514
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,480
code

515
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:13,439
and when i say what is wrong

516
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,439
let me just say that

517
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,280
there is something wrong with this

518
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,280
program

519
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,639
and the question is what is it and so

520
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,120
i'll let you look at this

521
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,679
i'll give you i'll give you again a

522
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,918
little bit of time

523
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,840
give you and give you a minute to look

524
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,240
at it

525
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,240
and

526
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,879
some of the old-timey programmers or

527
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:43,679
people who've done an awful lot of

528
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,679
systems work

529
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:49,279
have uh spotted this one i've given it

530
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,400
but

531
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:55,840
many many programmers look at this and

532
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,840
don't realize what's wrong with it

533
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,840
so i'll give you another 10 seconds to

534
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,840
look at it

535
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,960
okay

536
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:23,120
now on a 32-bit machine

537
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:27,279
i give the numbers here the same would

538
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:29,600
be true for a 64-bit or 128-bit

539
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,960
when you put in numbers that are near

540
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,279
the extremes

541
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,799
of the capacity of the numbers and add

542
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,919
them together

543
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,600
they overflow into a negative number

544
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,200
and so the program will print the sum of

545
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,240
two positive integers as always a

546
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,840
positive integer

547
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,600
and then it will print a negative

548
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:51,439
integer

549
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:54,799
the arithmetic that is done

550
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,480
on a computer system does not

551
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,840
always mirror what happens in the

552
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,960
outside world

553
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:04,320
because the values in a computer system

554
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,240
whether they're integral or floating

555
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,320
precision

556
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,279
are limited as to what they can

557
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,000
represent

558
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,440
they lose precision they lose values and

559
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
so if you're going to write code you

560
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,080
should always

561
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,640
check to make sure that you haven't hit

562
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,639
those limits

563
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,320
douglas adams uh not exactly a

564
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,360
philosopher

565
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,918
but a great thinker whose works i can

566
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,918
recommend highly

567
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,600
uh observe that in cases of major

568
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,720
discrepancy it's always reality that's

569
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,158
got it wrong

570
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:42,159
because reality is frequently inaccurate

571
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:45,760
which we know all too well

572
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:47,919
so remember what i started with

573
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,360
security or software engineering is

574
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,200
building system to do what you want them

575
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,039
to do

576
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,480
safety engineering is building systems

577
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,158
that don't do things you don't want them

578
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,840
to do

579
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,159
and security engineering is building

580
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:03,760
systems that only do what you want

581
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,880
them to do if you aren't clear what a

582
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,840
system should do

583
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,640
or what a system might do then you can't

584
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:13,360
constrain what it should do

585
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,880
or i should say will do that slide i got

586
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,158
it wrong

587
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,760
you can't constrain what it will do

588
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,760
the problem is if you don't really

589
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,799
understand if you don't understand the

590
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,120
requirements

591
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,960
if you don't understand the context if

592
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,559
you don't understand the limitations of

593
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,080
the programming language or the system

594
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,480
you're working with

595
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,000
if you don't understand the eventual

596
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,039
goals

597
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,559
no you can't build it correctly

598
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:41,120
and you're not going to be able to make

599
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,120
it secure

600
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,159
so that brings me to the end of the

601
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,559
slides

602
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,960
other than this one where i want to say

603
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:54,240
thank you for listening to me

604
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,559
and i will open this up

605
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:00,240
if anybody has any questions or comments

606
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,240
that you want to ask i'd be happy to

607
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,840

win says hi hey win

616
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,679
well we have some real positive feedback

617
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:49,840
we have plenty of time if anybody has a

618
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:49,840
thought-provoking question

619
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,000
all right lots of kudos um good to see

620
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:02,159
you spath

621

here i'll come on shad and i are here

622
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,760
he's kind of hiding there in the shadows

623
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:09,279
isn't he yeah yeah

624
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:12,399
his invisibility cloak has got a short

625
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,799
it's uh yeah it's uh he got it from boba

626
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,600
fett

627
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,080
and it was uh secondhand but uh we did

628
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,000
take the

629
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,120
death star down earlier so we're really

630
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,480
excited about that

631
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:24,320
excellent excellent we've we've hit some

632
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,080
of our deliverables for this conference

633
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,520
so yeah well you can see i'm giving the

634
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,158
talk from my control room and all my

635
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,760
minions have taken the afternoon off yes

636
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,919
yes i can see that

637
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,520
um i'm going to have to zoom in and see

638
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,960
if i can see any passwords on the

639
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,480
screens there

640
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,559
all right well hey it's it's great to

641
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,320
see you say hi to patty and uh

644
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,360
up

645
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,600
at 3 30 central in about nine minutes

646

with our next speaker our final speaker

647
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,320
is ira winkler uh talking about you can

648
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,200
stop stupid

649
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:00,879
so great presentation and that would be

650
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,880
great i would love to get him uh

651
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,720
to apply that to at least my university

652
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,479
administration

653
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,000
there you go there you go i'm sure we

654
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,720
all have some executives we'd include in

655
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,960
that list
