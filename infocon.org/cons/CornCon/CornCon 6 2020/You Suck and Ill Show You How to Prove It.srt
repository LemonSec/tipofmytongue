1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,240
pleasure all right let's try this again

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,400
three two one go all right folks welcome

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,240
um good morning good afternoon good

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,000
evening so uh rafflos

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,679
i uh you may know me i've run down the

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,079
security rabbit hole podcast since

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,840
about 2011. been in the security

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,198
industry about 20 years i've consulted

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,759
i've sold things i've done

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,279
stuff uh my expertise particularly over

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,240
the last decade or so in strategy

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,198
process

13
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,640
and optimization all super cool things

14
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,960
that'll never get me uh

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,160
uh interesting uh black cat talk but

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,120
that's all right because this is stuff

17
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,559
is needed too

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,399
i've done some red team blue team that

19
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,079
was all a very long time ago i run a

20
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,399
podcast as i've said

21
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,920
i occasionally write i'm a speaker i

22
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,640
tend to be a realist

23
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,239
and i am the white rabbit on twitter um

24
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,840
i am currently at a company called

25
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,879
lightstream if you've never heard of us

26
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,600
now is the time

27
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,039
ironically yesterday we launched our

28
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,800
security services business

29
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,879
i'm pretty proud of so give that a shot

30
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,160
we're also sponsoring the conference

31
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,599
so um this might be a good time to uh to

32
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,519
give us a look all right

33
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,439
let's dive in so why in the world are we

34
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,000
discussing metrics when everybody will

35
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,360
tell

36
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,880
me my metrics are just fine but you guys

37
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,000
all read the news right and i and i

38
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,000
think that

39
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,920
the key challenge here is how do we tell

40
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,040
a story in security because we're not

41
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,680
very good at

42
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,200
telling what's going on i'll get let you

43
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,400
stare at this for a second but this is

44
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,159
fairly recent

45
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,520
uh these things go around every once in

46
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,159
a while but you'll see this

47
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,720
thwarted 36 million email breach

48
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,000
attempts

49
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,240
wow that's a big scary number although

50
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,200
is it because i started to believe that

51
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,600
your boards

52
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,360
that you could use to scare to death a

53
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,079
long time ago with these big scary

54
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,720
numbers

55
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,320
uh are no longer ignorant of this i

56
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,880
think that they they are

57
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,839
desensitized to these headlines and

58
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,839
while

59
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,439
early on in my career 20 years ago i

60
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,920
could throw a headline at that and

61
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,360
everyone

62
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,280
would go oh gosh what do you need to fix

63
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,119
this make sure this doesn't happen to us

64
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,360
sorry it doesn't exist anymore and big

65
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,960
scary numbers just don't get the kind of

66
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,560
impact that we want

67
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,320
and actually wait a second if i look at

68
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,640
this

69
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,160
is is the fact that they're thwarting 36

70
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,119
million email reach attempts daily

71
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,160
forget the number

72
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,400
is that good or bad i mean

73
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,840
honestly is that good or bad because 36

74
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,560
that's the numerator right

75
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,160
is the denominator 36 or 100 or a

76
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,879
thousand

77
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,720
so are they are they forwarding 100 or

78
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,599
like over a third

79
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,760
and therein lies the problem because

80
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:30,480
denominators

81
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,399
matter we tend to forget that and when i

82
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,560
look at security dashboards and security

83
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,760
metrics and things that security tools

84
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,120
uh throw at you

85
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,920
the problem is metrics don't tell a

86
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,920
story they really don't tell you what's

87
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,480
going on they give you big numbers and

88
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,760
we have

89
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,079
insecurity over the last 20 25 or so

90
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,399
years every dashboard i've ever seen

91
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,920
throws really scary things at you throws

92
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,160
lots of numbers at you in hopes that it

93
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,920
will convince you it's doing a good job

94
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,359
so lots and lots and lots and lots of

95
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,040
numbers uh

96
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,319
but i hope you guys understand the

97
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,920
difference between leading and trailing

98
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,238
indicators and i'll come back to this a

99
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,079
couple of times and focused on this

100
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,840
by the way there's a lot of content in

101
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,319
this talk if you want slides you guys

102
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,159
know how to find me

103
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,518
i will also try to post these probably

104
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,440
someplace and i'm sure this recording

105
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,440
will be made available but

106
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,040
leading in trailing indicators keep that

107
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,680
in the back of your head

108
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,480
and remember uh just this concept really

109
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,840
quickly

110
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:31,440
so things are

111
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,000
better are they and why

112
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,359
so we can we tell you if things are can

113
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,400
i tell you if things are better in our

114
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,599
organization

115
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,319
um and then can i tell you why

116
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,839
but that is the difference between a

117
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,359
leading and trailing indicator and that

118
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,200
isn't the problem with today's metrics

119
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,519
is that we get into this situation where

120
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,238
we

121
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,720
we try to draw trends and trend lines

122
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,080
and

123
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,319
identify um

124
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,000
the different types of numbers that we

125
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,518
want people to understand

126
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,599
and we don't do a very good job at them

127
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,599
and then we sort of fold our hands and

128
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,599
say well they just don't get it or

129
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,359
uh you know business just doesn't care

130
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,720
about security i think they do i just

131
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,000
don't think they understand what in the

132
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,879
heck we're saying to them

133
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,400
and there are in my opinion three very

134
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,760
valid reasons that there are poor

135
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,160
metrics out there the first one is a

136
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,918
lack of knowledge or experience

137
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,120
listen i can't fault anybody for not

138
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,758
having the proper knowledge or

139
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,840
experience

140
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,080
i was there i'm still there in a lot of

141
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,440
areas i don't know everything and i know

142
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,359
far from everything

143
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,360
and no matter how much time you spend in

144
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,040
this industry it seems like the longer

145
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,560
you stay in this industry the less you

146
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,880
actually know of the collective whole

147
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,960
because

148
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,440
it keeps growing at a pace that most of

149
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,440
us can't keep up with

150
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,800
and i think that's pretty much a fact so

151
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,000
the other one is really a fear of

152
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,520
delivering bad news

153
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,120
nobody wants to be the person to go up

154
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,159
in front of a you know their executives

155
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,199
or their board and say

156
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,199
we are terrible at what we do so we

157
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,400
fudge things we make it look good

158
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,400
we we try to uh we try to make sure that

159
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,758
we show our numbers in a positive light

160
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,960
and i think that does us a terrible

161
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,759
disservice

162
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,799
um and and the last and final one is is

163
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,160
spreading fud

164
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,000
now you guys know if you're uncertainty

165
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,919
in doubt that's the scare tactics route

166
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
right that's that's the uh thing we used

167
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,880
to rely on many years ago where we'd say

168
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,360
you know oh my gosh

169
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,400
if you don't do this the worst thing in

170
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,000
the world will happen and

171
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,440
we'll lose all our customers and it'll

172
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,360
get terrible and

173
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,600
you know what i tell you bad news is

174
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,199
okay and sometimes

175
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,160
bad news is good but unfortunately and

176
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,360
i'm sorry elmer

177
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,720
fudd is never good okay so fun is never

178
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,600
a good idea

179
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,080
um it's never good to try to scare your

180
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,199
your

181
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,359
audience and here's why because you've

182
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,680
got two possible scenarios you can say

183
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,280
if

184
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,479
i don't do it you know if you don't let

185
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,239
me do this or if you don't give me this

186
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,360
budget this horrible thing will happen

187
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,120
and one of two things happens either

188
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,639
you don't get the budget you don't get

189
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,800
the thing you don't get the

190
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,280
whatever it is you wanted and nothing

191
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,400
happens and then you have to go well

192
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,960
we were lucky or maybe the threat wasn't

193
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,960
real and i kind of look like an idiot

194
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,239
which may not even be true but that's

195
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,080
the perception and of course we know

196
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,919
perception becomes reality easily

197
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,599
the other thing is what if you do get

198
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,198
the budget you do get the authority you

199
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,160
do get the thing

200
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,199
and you still get popped because then

201
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,120
what

202
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,639
so fudd never works let's start with

203
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,160
that um

204
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,680
so i've got this thing called the bridge

205
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,319
method uh and

206
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,759
it's it's relatively simple uh and i'll

207
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,440
teach it i'll show you guys how to do it

208
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,960
there's a lot again a lot of information

209
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,719
in this so

210
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,080
please don't try to keep up with

211
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,280
everything and try and taking notes

212
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,719
because it probably isn't going to just

213
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,239
just hit you know listen as much as

214
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,360
you'd like and then uh

215
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,520
you know if you've got questions i'll

216
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,639
happily answer them so if you think

217
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,280
about the bridge you've got

218
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,680
uh one bank you've got desired outcomes

219
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,280
the

220
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,960
other bank you've got security data

221
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,799
and you got to figure out how to get

222
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,599
between the two

223
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,840
so this method is actually quite simple

224
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,800
and i think it's relatively easy to get

225
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:06,479
from point a to point b

226
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,039
um and i think you know the couple steps

227
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,318
in this

228
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,000
are number one understand the opposing

229
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,720
banks know what's on each side know what

230
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,360
the other side

231
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,440
has what you want how to get there

232
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,759
select the materials you want to use

233
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,520
build the foundation build the bridge

234
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,520
and then last and not least

235
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,880
please don't forget this last bit

236
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,680
maintain the bridge

237
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,440
don't forget that once you've built a

238
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,039
program once you've built a set of

239
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,080
things

240
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,840
it doesn't magically uh add in fun item

241
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,639
maintain itself if you just walk away

242
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,239
from it

243
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:42,000
right things have to continue to be to

244
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,000
be run uh against some schedule so

245
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,759
first things first you have to know your

246
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,759
audience and there are three levels of

247
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,240
metrics and three levels of reporting

248
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,199
uh in my experience uh level one is

249
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,199
internal metrics

250
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,639
right this is stuff that secops wants to

251
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,520
know how many

252
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,000
uh how many times has the particular av

253
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,560
signature

254
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,720
triggered uh how many times uh did we

255
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,120
have to go wipe a machine because it got

256
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,160
you know whatever version of uh crypto

257
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,360
locker it is out there

258
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,520
now how many phishing emails came in so

259
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,440
these are these are operational metrics

260
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,120
they don't really uh they don't really

261
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,759
change anything but it helps you

262
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,720
understand

263
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,319
you know how busy you are um whether

264
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,919
you're you know if you have a zero on a

265
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,520
network segment of for in terms of

266
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,159
detections maybe it's not even plugged

267
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,680
in

268
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,360
um i wish i had a quarter for every time

269
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,240
that happened in life

270
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,159
uh but that's a very real thing right

271
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,479
and then security leadership metrics

272
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,559
so these are level two metrics these

273
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,039
support decision making

274
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,799
so these help us decide as our

275
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,199
investment in cyber security in the

276
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:46,719
right place are we doing it right

277
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,680
um are we are we ultimately um

278
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,839
are we supporting the right methods are

279
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,959
we going in the right direction

280
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,279
um again is the investment correct or is

281
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,439
it

282
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,680
directionally sound and then there's the

283
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,560
last part which is executive metrics and

284
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,560
i think

285
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,199
rather than continuing to pile the other

286
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,599
previous

287
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,440
two in which is sort of what's what's

288
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,360
been happening for a long time and i

289
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,040
i get it there's a lot of companies that

290
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,240
i've gotten way better at this

291
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,000
but still um you know i still get

292
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,760
uh questions the reason that this i made

293
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,600
this talk for this conference is because

294
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,200
i kept getting questions around the talk

295
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,560
i did in 2011

296
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,000
at oasp around apsec and so i thought it

297
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,560
was time to review

298
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,200
and so security metrics at the executive

299
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,359
level

300
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,839
really is meant to show the value of

301
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,360
security and we're going to focus here

302
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,160
on this third level because i think the

303
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,839
other two are

304
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,839
pretty self-explanatory they're pretty

305
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,480
easy and even if you screw them up

306
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,920
you're the audience right so if you do a

307
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,279
lot of work and it shows you nothing

308
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,040
well then you've harmed yourself or

309
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,880
you've wasted your own time

310
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,160
you don't want to be the person that's

311
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,200
standing out there

312
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,800
uh professing uh something and and get

313
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,600
called on it in front of a

314
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,279
broader organization or your i.t peers

315
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,519
or your executive peers

316
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,600
so if we get a little you know we if we

317
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,519
can kind of dive behind the curtain here

318
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,800
uh and get in and let's go ahead and get

319
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,480
started

320
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,519
let's talk first about these this

321
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,200
concept of the understanding the

322
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,720
opposing banks

323
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,560
there's i would tell you there's three

324
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,680
things that you got to do in rapid

325
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,839
succession

326
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,279
and a couple of friends that i know and

327
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,720
myself included we

328
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,320
every time we used to be up on stage in

329
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,399
front of our audience or

330
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,519
you know talking about security whether

331
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,720
it's a meeting or

332
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,320
or whatever it's pretty easy to ask the

333
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,959
security people in the room what is it

334
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,040
that you do

335
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,680
at your company what do you what do you

336
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,519
do at whatever company you work for

337
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,839
and some people will tell you i secure

338
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,560
this or i do apps like that or i pen

339
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,000
test this

340
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,160
or i defend that and the reality is

341
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,480
yes but that's not really that's not

342
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,959
really what it you do what the company

343
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,040
does

344
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,880
why you exist you exist if you're a

345
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,519
retail company to sell stuff if your

346
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,160
services company is to do services if

347
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,079
you're

348
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,680
an airline to you know get people from

349
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:05,040
point a to point b

350
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:08,239
right security is a component of that or

351
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,399
overall goal and your company has goals

352
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,279
uh they're probably in a in a you know

353
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,079
uh quarterly mission statement or on a

354
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,200
plaque uh

355
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,000
in the main lobby of your office or you

356
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,120
know it's on

357
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,880
the stationary or something i promise

358
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,760
you you have goals or either

359
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,040
you know somewhere around three to five

360
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,360
you know goals for the year for the

361
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,680
company or the quarter of the semester

362
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,800
whatever it is but they're usually

363
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,279
pretty lofty

364
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,640
right you have to understand these i

365
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,079
don't mean just like read them and look

366
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,399
at them and go okay cool i get it but no

367
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,439
i

368
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,240
actually go through and understand what

369
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,800
do they mean

370
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,720
why do that exist if if you live uh you

371
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,240
know if you live and breathe security at

372
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,200
a hospital network

373
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,040
uh for example odds are and we'll use

374
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,399
this in a later example here odds are

375
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,719
you care about

376
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,560
people living and dying right so that's

377
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,079
a that's that's pretty important

378
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:05,199
um that said

379
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,479
if um if the organization wants to

380
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,519
increase

381
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,639
uh its survivability rate or become you

382
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,200
know better

383
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,120
for patient care or whatever it is you

384
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,839
got to figure out how you fit into that

385
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,519
how you apply what you do in cyber

386
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,240
security what you do

387
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,200
in policy or compliance or or run

388
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,360
networks or

389
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,040
develop applications whatever part of it

390
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,720
you work in how do you support that

391
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,959
overall goal

392
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,399
that is super super super super super

393
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,279
important because none of the rest of

394
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,200
this

395
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,880
makes any sense if you don't get that

396
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,399
and i know that's fundamental and sort

397
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,200
of you know flintstone

398
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,399
bedrock style but it's i have to keep

399
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,399
repeating it because it's

400
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,240
it to me it's so important so what is

401
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,200
the business trying to achieve and you

402
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,399
want to be

403
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,079
specific not just get better because get

404
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,880
better is difficult to to

405
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,680
measure usually there are specific

406
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,959
metrics

407
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,880
uh whether they're you know okrs

408
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,079
is a popular thing to talk about now or

409
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,160
whatever it is

410
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,719
organ organizations have things they

411
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,240
want to achieve and you

412
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,480
have to ask yourself does your security

413
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,720
strategy align i'm going to assume

414
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,320
yes for now and if it doesn't then

415
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,079
i think you may have you may have a

416
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,519
different problem but

417
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,279
assuming yes because you're talking

418
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,000
about measuring alignment let's assume

419
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,279
that you you're

420
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,480
at least reasonably closely aligned so i

421
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,160
like to talk about the

422
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,000
magic of odd numbers three and like

423
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,240
numbers three and five particularly

424
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,680
uh if you're going to produce metrics or

425
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,800
you're going to teach somebody

426
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:39,920
something do it in in three and fives

427
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,959
uh it's a weird psychology thing

428
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,599
it makes it prominent for people longer

429
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,839
term

430
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,600
and i'll tell you develop three key

431
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,800
value metrics

432
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,040
and the value a value metric is

433
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,719
something like security supports x goal

434
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,599
by y action so

435
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,240
security supports the organization's

436
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,600
desire

437
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,720
to uh grow by 30 percent

438
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,880
in the you know buy coming up with it

439
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,839
and i i know some of you are listening

440
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,920
and going i

441
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,880
i that doesn't make any sense to me

442
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,760
because what i do

443
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,680
is i pen test i have nothing to do with

444
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,120
the business making a better profit

445
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,680
i promise you you do uh and those of you

446
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,760
that

447
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,359
have been in the industry a while or are

448
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,279
trying to break in this is the language

449
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,920
you absolutely have to learn and speak

450
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,199
there's no other way around that let me

451
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,479
give you a couple examples i'll come

452
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,160
back to this one

453
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,560
at the hospital and this is one i've

454
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,240
heard a long long long time ago

455
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,839
one of the one of the best meetings i've

456
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,399
ever had was

457
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,839
in a hospital network and the person

458
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,440
told me security supports the goal of

459
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,120
increasing the lives

460
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,519
saved by two percent there's your

461
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,199
concrete number by decreasing the amount

462
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,639
of time doctors wait on access to

463
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:54,319
critical information

464
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:56,639
right so in in some cases it may be

465
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,000
caching data locally or decreasing the

466
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,199
time it takes to authenticate

467
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,320
into a device where in fact most of us

468
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,199
like to go oh we need to do two-factor

469
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,959
authentication

470
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,160
and some other very important things as

471
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,040
you guys probably just heard on this

472
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,680
track earlier

473
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,800
you know like 2fa is super important 2fa

474
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,199
when you're trying to uh

475
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,560
take a second out of the entire process

476
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,920
to save somebody's life

477
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,239
probably not the most important thing in

478
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,839
that in that uh in that cycle

479
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,760
but you got to understand that right you

480
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,560
got to apply security to that

481
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,399
let's talk about a logistics company

482
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,959
security supports the goal of reducing

483
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,880
the time

484
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,638
spent in a hold state which means

485
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,199
logistics pat a company moves packages

486
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,360
around or

487
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,719
moves things around freight whatever so

488
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,720
reducing the time

489
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,000
uh spent in a hold state which means the

490
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,839
time something sits in it

491
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,279
and doesn't move by increasing

492
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,240
information availability on remote

493
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,519
devices

494
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,440
how many of you guys are listening right

495
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,720
now going uh information on remote

496
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,720
devices cringe

497
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,880
right because data is leaving that safe

498
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,560
haven of my data center or

499
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,320
my cloud app or whatever it is it's

500
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,359
going to somebody's phone or somebody's

501
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,000
ipad or

502
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,680
some dashboard somewhere on a on a

503
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,959
electric car out of whatever

504
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,279
so this is um you know

505
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,319
this is not a super specific one but if

506
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,439
they would say

507
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,440
reduce time spent in a whole state by

508
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,040
five percent by seven minutes by

509
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,560
something right you have something

510
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,279
concrete to go aim at

511
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,239
because if i tell you go make it better

512
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,880
you're gonna ask me

513
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,480
uh by how much and what does that mean

514
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,759
let's talk about retailers security

515
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,199
supports this is gonna be a cool example

516
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,600
so security support's the goal of

517
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,839
increasing sales in a pandemic

518
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,800
uh it's as if we were in one of those

519
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,880
right now

520
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,719
uh and everybody's trying to figure out

521
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,320
how to bolster sales how to get people

522
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,040
in the door how to get buyers buying

523
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,480
again

524
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,880
uh how to you know can keep their

525
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,759
business from going under so increasing

526
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,839
sales this is

527
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,759
a general statement but say was by ten

528
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,600
percent by five percent heck

529
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,880
by supporting a contactless payment

530
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,240
process everybody's launching

531
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,320
contactless everything

532
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,519
but you know that means sometimes it

533
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,120
means creating an entirely new

534
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,480
application sometimes it means creating

535
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,240
an entirely new process

536
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,559
data has to move from one system to

537
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,480
another and security is often at the

538
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,079
point where going well you can't do that

539
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,839
business is like i can and i will

540
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,918
otherwise we'll all be out of business

541
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,198
so figure it out right you guys have

542
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,799
probably heard stuff like that i know i

543
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,640
have throughout my career

544
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,160
and the idea is to use the appropriate

545
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,640
level of language

546
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,720
in the conversation we have so as you

547
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,799
talk as you make statements for example

548
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,079
like this one on the retailer

549
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,520
right what are the things that security

550
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,799
could do here

551
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,320
think about it in abstract terms

552
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,879
and i know you can think of a million

553
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,520
things that are security oriented and

554
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,760
have

555
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,000
language that your execs probably have

556
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,840
will have no idea what you're saying

557
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,440
but think of the right of an appropriate

558
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,678
level of language and

559
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,360
as you do that think of security as the

560
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,160
enabler

561
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,799
think of security as the enabler for a

562
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,840
process

563
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:58,400
and it tends to surprise uh

564
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,678
people when you go oh yeah a cyber

565
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,799
security folks we're going to help you

566
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,400
buy

567
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:06,000
something and the the executive teams

568
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,840
the business leaders that have been

569
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,160
around the industry a long time

570
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,439
sometimes get shocked uh when we

571
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,600
approach them and say yeah we're going

572
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,960
to act like an enabler for you

573
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,639
because we get it we know what the

574
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,240
problem is we know you're struggling

575
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,520
and we have some ideas on how to make

576
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,280
things better not just how to slow

577
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,799
things down

578
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,320
so let's come back to leading and

579
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,520
trailing indicators

580
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,840
um there's not really a way to you're

581
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,200
not

582
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,959
all in front of me so i can't get you to

583
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,360
raise your hands but think about it how

584
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,720
many

585
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,399
of you guys actually know the difference

586
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,440
between a leading and trailing indicator

587
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,080
what they mean

588
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,440
and how to get them the unfortunate part

589
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,960
of most of your metrics are trailing

590
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,200
indicators what that means is

591
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,120
you're measuring the results which is

592
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,000
fine

593
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,199
but they only tell you what's already

594
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,400
happened

595
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,480
right so i mean again perfectly fine

596
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,559
and they will tell you uh that you have

597
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,840
improved or not those of you that

598
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:03,120
are formula one fans like i am sometimes

599
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,720
you watch a driver

600
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,799
uh you know one race to another go

601
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,000
around the track uh same track and

602
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,600
they've taken out like

603
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,760
two tenths of a second you're like wow

604
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,600
that's incredible that's that's really

605
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,799
that's a lot faster then you sort of go

606
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,000
okay

607
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,720
what did they do like what happened they

608
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,880
improved

609
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,960
but why right so the people that that

610
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,640
control these things

611
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,559
uh that people that care which

612
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,600
insecurity is you and i

613
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:32,320
want to know why so you want to know

614
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,918
why something changed right did it get

615
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,960
it got better or worse

616
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:40,080
why and so actionx

617
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:43,520
resulted in reaction y these

618
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,360
are the examples that i've been using

619
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,240
for years and and

620
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,840
it's very true that we typically if you

621
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,600
look at almost every dashboard that

622
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,000
you've you've seen built if you look at

623
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,639
the

624
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,679
uh stuff that our vendors provide us it

625
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,520
is

626
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,919
reaction y right even the trend lines

627
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,600
are

628
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,960
every month we've discovered you know

629
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,840
this many new vulnerabilities and you

630
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,240
sort of look at it and go okay but

631
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:10,399
why there's a talk i did a long time ago

632
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,640
about software security vulnerabilities

633
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,080
and i showed a trend graph from one of

634
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,840
my clients at the time

635
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,600
and it was the number of vulnerability

636
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,439
critical vulnerabilities in in the

637
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,480
enterprise going up and it was

638
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,720
crazy going up and

639
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,000
that almost got that person fired and

640
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,799
he's like i don't get it

641
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,320
you know how is why is this why is this

642
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,879
such a such a thing and i said

643
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,320
okay what are you telling people are you

644
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,000
showing me that

645
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,600
your enterprise your enterprise

646
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,480
development life cycle is getting worse

647
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,158
at security

648
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,760
or are you showing me that your accuracy

649
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,080
is getting better in testing

650
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,600
or do you have more tools or that you

651
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,639
scan more applications and

652
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,480
they went oh

653
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,760
right so let me give you a concrete

654
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,600
example

655
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,440
your vulnerability scanner found a

656
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,480
thousand new critical vulnerabilities

657
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,799
today

658
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,280
versus the last time it ran think about

659
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:05,039
what your reaction would be

660
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,639
mine is why i want to know

661
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,280
why and that's usually the look on my

662
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:12,159
face is oh well that's interesting

663
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,440
what happened there right um those of

664
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,559
you familiar with archer

665
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,799
uh know that look well so the reality is

666
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,639
you added 10 new subnets to the to the

667
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,320
vulnerability scanner that you've never

668
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,480
scanned before

669
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,480
so you've given yourself you know that

670
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,760
much more coverage of the organization

671
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,600
how much more coverage i don't know how

672
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,520
many subnets do you totally have

673
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,199
let that kind of permeate through your

674
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,240
brain for a second

675
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,760
but what the lesson learned here is more

676
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,600
coverage means ta-da

677
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,440
more results and the problem is if all i

678
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,199
gave you was that you have a thousand

679
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,039
new vulnerabilities

680
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,679
you the trailing indicator which is that

681
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,760
will tell you what happened

682
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,679
you found a thousand new vulnerabilities

683
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,679
and for the most part you'd go oh my

684
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,280
gosh we are so much worse than we were

685
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,640
the last time this thing ran how could

686
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,360
we be that bad

687
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,440
when in reality you're actually probably

688
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,240
this is a that's a great number to have

689
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,840
if you tell me why right so the leading

690
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,159
indicator tells you why and you

691
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,840
absolutely desperately 100 percent

692
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,720
guaranteed no doubt about it need

693
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,158
both of them if you don't have both

694
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,080
leading and trailing indicators on your

695
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,480
dashboards today ask yourself what kind

696
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,080
of story are you telling

697
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,559
and are you wondering why nobody is

698
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,678
listening or paying attention

699
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:31,440
this may be the reason all right so now

700
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,280
that you've unders you get a decent

701
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,720
understanding of both sides of it

702
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,399
let's talk about what you're working

703
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,000
with so again i'm going to make this

704
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,159
assumption that your security strategy

705
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
is aligned to business outcomes it's

706
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,760
something you can sit and reflect on and

707
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,280
think about and go okay are we

708
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,240
supporting the mission it's cyber

709
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,158
security

710
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,080
info security enterprise security

711
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,159
security whatever you call yourselves as

712
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,280
an organization

713
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,240
do you support the business the answer

714
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,678
is either yes

715
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,559
or no if you do things that the company

716
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,480
cares about

717
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,678
and i promise you the things are not

718
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,159
security

719
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,960
how do you protect how do you enable how

720
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,280
do you

721
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,360
um you know do all those things process

722
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,799
optimize etc etc

723
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,799
those are important things to think

724
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,280
about and this is for you to reflect on

725
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,158
right

726
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,918
if not if you don't support that

727
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,600
business if your security strategy is

728
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,760
not tightly aligned

729
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,719
if you don't have a strong security lead

730
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,799
cso director

731
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,080
vp whatever this will not work

732
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,320
because you're going to be building

733
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,280
castles on with sand and it will not

734
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,840
work

735
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,600
so each goal likely has multiple support

736
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,000
supporting projects or activities so if

737
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:43,439
you've got a goal

738
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,600
to help the organization you know um

739
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,440
you know create five percent more sales

740
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,520
by deploying that contactless payment

741
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,480
application

742
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,679
how do you do that um how do you get

743
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,520
what are the activities

744
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,279
i bet you it's not a single security

745
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,480
project or a single security activity

746
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,720
there's probably like

747
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,480
half a dozen maybe more of things that

748
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,760
support everything from appsec

749
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,200
to you know reviews to tooling to

750
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,400
architecture and all these things that

751
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,200
get involved

752
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,159
so you get to measure the existing state

753
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,159
at start so

754
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,360
how bad is it how good is it i don't

755
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,880
know how is it

756
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,120
right you get to make that better good

757
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,840
decision uh ephemerally at some point

758
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,760
but

759
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,120
talk to me about how it what it looks

760
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,200
like right now

761
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,799
uh and a lot of us go well i don't know

762
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,320
i have no way of knowing how matters i

763
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,879
don't we don't that doesn't exist today

764
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,799
great

765
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,279
if it doesn't exist that's a measurable

766
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,720
state that's a zero

767
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,720
it's not a terrible place to start

768
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,240
frankly and you're going to end up

769
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,400
building this pyramid

770
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,880
um if you've never seen anybody build

771
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:46,080
one of these they're pretty interesting

772
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,559
it's basically again very simple

773
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,520
uh tactical metrics at the bottom these

774
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,279
are uh

775
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,520
technical data demonstrate effectiveness

776
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,360
of your activities right so how many

777
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,639
uh again how many vulnerabilities have

778
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,479
you found how many times have you

779
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,279
scanned how many developers have taken

780
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,440
training

781
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,120
uh how many reused modules were there

782
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,080
talking applications like these are all

783
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,678
pretty easy things to do security impact

784
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,240
this is a little trickier because you

785
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:13,120
say because of x the result was y

786
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,440
on a security level so because security

787
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:18,320
implemented

788
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,000
a new tool and it got 80 coverage the

789
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,120
developers thereby produced

790
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,480
applications that had 20 percent less

791
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,199
critical vulnerabilities

792
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,480
release over release i mean that's a

793
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,279
valid thing to say

794
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,000
i i it takes years to get to that point

795
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,080
sometimes

796
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,520
but that's your security impact metric

797
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,559
and now you get that at

798
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,639
one or two strategic metrics these are

799
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,120
evidence of a positive or negative goal

800
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,120
level

801
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,799
impact so these are things that you

802
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,439
should think about what is your positive

803
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,918
or negative

804
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,720
uh result sorry action against that goal

805
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,559
what is your

806
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,279
impact to that overall goal that the

807
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:55,440
company or the organization has

808
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,960
so things like 75 of devops teams

809
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,000
trained on tools absent coverage

810
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,200
increased by 50

811
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,520
critical votes in the application were

812
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,880
down by 30 these are all very legitimate

813
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,960
things to report on

814
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,480
do they go straight to the strategic no

815
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,679
because you can't

816
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,679
clearly draw that line right but you can

817
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,520
roll those up and say all those together

818
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,360
decreased application risk by

819
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,720
x as a result of optimized tooling

820
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,279
devops processes

821
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,400
in the tactical uh part of the pyramid

822
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,799
and then all

823
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,240
several roll-up metrics right

824
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,960
implementing security process

825
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,240
x allowed 50 faster iterative releases

826
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,679
of touchless payment widget which means

827
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,279
we got it to market faster which means

828
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,039
people could use it faster

829
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,520
which means ultimately people buy more

830
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:38,080
and spend more and yay profitability

831
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,760
so that is how you kind of build that

832
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,559
pyramid up it's how you demonstrate

833
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,240
these things

834
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:45,360
i i would be uh i'd be remiss if i told

835
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,000
you that visuals

836
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,080
in the pyramid like this are uh are

837
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,640
useless i love building these

838
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,279
because you can see you know fives three

839
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,039
four five

840
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,960
seven ten fifteen of these tactical

841
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,000
metrics roll up into like one or two or

842
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,559
three of these again

843
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
three and fives it's a magic number uh

844
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,440
into these um

845
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,600
into these roll-up metrics and then you

846
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,200
can directly show impact against that

847
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,760
strategy that the business is trying to

848
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,279
take

849
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,799
and that is pretty it's a magical point

850
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,919
when you can get to that it's pretty

851
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,360
cool

852
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:19,440
so ensure your results are repeatable

853
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:22,799
i can't stress this enough

854
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:25,440
if you can't um

855
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:27,360
if you can't repeat something this is uh

856
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,640
this is why some science becomes bunk

857
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,559
because you're like oh

858
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,559
i tested something or i i ran this

859
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,360
process and i got the answer 25 you go

860
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,320
great do it again

861
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,918
like oh i got 37 this time like okay do

862
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,520
it again oh i got 12 this time

863
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,039
all right that's not repeatable because

864
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,440
what in the heck are you doing

865
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,360
so you have to be able to do the thing

866
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,480
right do the collection process or do

867
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,799
whatever it is to get your

868
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,039
your metrics repeatedly to get the same

869
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:54,080
number consistency

870
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:55,200
and precision are important uh so ensure

871
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,639
results are repeatable and then of

872
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,640
course show your work

873
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,480
uh remember back in uh back in grade

874
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,120
school and in high school for some of us

875
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,720
uh

876
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,799
you know you can you could get the

877
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,480
problem wrong in math and physics but if

878
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,679
you showed your work even if the the

879
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,880
answer was wrong you could still get

880
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,120
partial credit

881
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,039
uh not quite like that but it's similar

882
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,879
right show your work is important people

883
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,360
want to know that you're not doing black

884
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,840
magic behind the scenes there

885
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,479
and guys you know this is security we

886
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,399
have been doing

887
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,760
magic and saying trust me i'm the expert

888
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:28,239
here for 20 25 years in some cases

889
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,360
it doesn't win you any favors to say i'm

890
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,559
smarter than you just

891
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,320
believe me because they don't right

892
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,240
they want to see how you got there

893
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,080
people want to be educated you should

894
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,480
want to show them

895
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,000
all right step 3 strong foundation is

896
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,799
essential

897
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,480
and to build that foundation you have to

898
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,840
build a draft of the pyramid build

899
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,559
yourself one of these things they're

900
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,840
kind of fun

901
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:53,279
find a white board uh you know grab a

902
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,840
piece of paper

903
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,120
uh just draw it out physically i'm a

904
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,799
very visual

905
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,479
person so i could put this in a

906
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,240
spreadsheet and it wouldn't make like

907
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,679
my brain couldn't grapple with it but i

908
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,080
put it on a whiteboard like oh i get it

909
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,399
now it's

910
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,720
easy right so demonstrating that role of

911
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,039
value is important and what you want to

912
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,919
do

913
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:15,520
with that target audience that you have

914
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:17,200
is get the light bulb to go on

915
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,480
it's it's going to feel differently if

916
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,600
you've never done this before because

917
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,720
people are going to look at you and go

918
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,678
oh i get it and that is one of those

919
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,600
moments where

920
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,960
suddenly life feels much better and you

921
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,840
don't feel like the redheaded stepchild

922
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,760
and ignored kid in the room

923
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,959
hopefully you don't feel like that now

924
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,158
but there's a

925
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,880
you know there's a lot of you out there

926
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:39,279
that still struggle with

927
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,240
relevance and being noticed and being

928
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,399
taken seriously

929
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,679
and that moment when the light bulb goes

930
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,719
on because you've shown them

931
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:49,360
impact metrics something that makes them

932
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,320
understand that all those that magic you

933
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,320
do

934
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,918
in the back offices in the basements of

935
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,039
their buildings with all that money

936
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:56,960
they've given you

937
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,640
that it actually does something for

938
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,360
their bottom line or their overall

939
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,520
mission

940
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,439
i tell you what you're gonna get but be

941
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,840
prepared for something

942
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,760
you will get peppered and hammered with

943
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,678
questions in q a and

944
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,279
and people wanting to know more that's

945
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,799
okay except for

946
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,000
that it gets kind of uncomfortable for

947
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,279
those of us that you know don't want to

948
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,760
stand around 100 people for

949
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,480
all day so make sense to all the

950
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,039
stakeholders

951
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,720
make sure that they understand and it

952
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,640
makes sense to them it's that light bulb

953
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,399
moment it's got to make sense to them

954
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,200
not just that it to you and your team

955
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,639
because obviously it's going to make

956
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,480
sense to you built it

957
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,080
make it make sense to your stakeholders

958
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,520
make sure that the person you're talking

959
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,039
to this is a level 3 metric your

960
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,039
executives and your board

961
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,240
go ask them does this make sense to you

962
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,320
and if they sort of go uh-huh

963
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,520
go no no no seriously like does this

964
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,520
does this

965
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,440
going from here to here to here does

966
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,918
this make sense

967
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,120
and make sure that they you verify that

968
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,880
with your audience

969
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,799
and it's not just like get the head nod

970
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,000
but get that buy-in make sure they go

971
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,080
yeah you know what

972
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,360
this is how i want to see you reporting

973
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,080
what you do

974
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,840
and once you've got that that aha moment

975
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,678
that oh yeah here we go

976
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,678
this is how we're going to do it this is

977
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,440
how i demonstrate value this is how i

978
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,679
get promoted this is how

979
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,600
i i show that i'm valuable part of this

980
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,760
company not just because

981
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,439
you know the uh some regulatory body

982
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,519
says i have to exist but i actually

983
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,720
valued here

984
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,159
that moment of buy-in is is is

985
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,159
really really a great feeling and a

986
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,720
really brilliant moment so

987
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,919
next step get get it built well look

988
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,399
this this part of the

989
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:33,440
the conversation is relatively simple

990
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:37,039
it's developing your collection process

991
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:39,279
at one point in my career i was new to a

992
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,640
security team in a very very large

993
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,120
company

994
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,760
and i ended up being the metrics guy for

995
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,678
the month

996
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,120
and we all rotated right so somebody's

997
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,440
job was to go to

998
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,760
all the different platforms we had

999
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,240
semantic antivirus gun helpless and you

1000
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,879
know

1001
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,760
our snort instance and whatever else we

1002
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,519
had out there

1003
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,080
and collect the metrics that we said we

1004
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:02,799
would collect this usually means

1005
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,399
lots of csv exports lots of screenshots

1006
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:07,600
copying into a spreadsheet

1007
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:11,360
massaging data uh color coding like

1008
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:13,120
that job sucked um and

1009
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,799
maybe you gave that to your intern for a

1010
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,199
while it's a hazing project i don't know

1011
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,799
but

1012
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,600
hopefully develop that collection

1013
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,240
process make sure it doesn't suck for

1014
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,439
somebody

1015
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,039
make sure remember when i said it should

1016
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,559
be repeatable make sure your collection

1017
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:27,440
process is repeatable

1018
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:28,399
and then collect aggregate refine and

1019
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,960
distill

1020
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,799
take all the data you can aggregate it

1021
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,480
in a way that makes sense where the data

1022
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:38,000
actually tells a story

1023
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,519
refine it get it to tell the right story

1024
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,279
because just throwing together numbers

1025
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,000
really isn't all that exciting get it to

1026
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:45,200
tell the story

1027
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,919
that you want right because you know

1028
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,760
there these are just numbers um and and

1029
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,679
ultimately you wanted to tell the

1030
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,440
the thing that you wanted to tell using

1031
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,279
the truth of the numbers

1032
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,279
and then the stimulus does not all not

1033
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,960
every metric is required and not every

1034
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,440
metric is going to give you a good

1035
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,640
number

1036
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,640
or something that you care about

1037
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,360
so it's important that you distill these

1038
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,320
things and ask do i need this

1039
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:13,039
does this make sense does this tell a

1040
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,200
proper story or just added a confusion

1041
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,960
and again automate automate automate

1042
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,080
automate automate automate as much as

1043
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,919
possible

1044
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,439
because i promise you nobody's excited

1045
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,640
about collecting metrics i

1046
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,200
i really can't stress that enough

1047
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,480
so automate and create visuals i'm a big

1048
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,120
visual person i

1049
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,880
love visuals i love stop signs red

1050
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,439
yellow green

1051
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,279
right simplicity for me is awesome if i

1052
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,080
can look at your metrics dashboard and

1053
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,000
see it's green

1054
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,439
i'm excited that's great if i see it's

1055
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,200
yellow it makes me a little nervous i

1056
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,760
get a little anxiety

1057
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,640
if it's red i'm starting to ask you know

1058
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,480
before you even

1059
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,320
hit the chair i'm going hold on hold on

1060
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,279
why is this red why am i red on this

1061
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,360
dashboard

1062
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:55,120
i used to you know work for uh an

1063
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,639
organization with a bunch of cios of

1064
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,239
separate businesses

1065
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,159
and we got them to a state where they

1066
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,640
competed with each other

1067
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,760
nobody wanted to be red and if they were

1068
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,679
yellow they were like

1069
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,279
you know you could always tell because

1070
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,000
the dashboards went out you know a day

1071
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:11,199
before the big

1072
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,599
you know explanatory meeting

1073
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,239
and the people the the businesses that

1074
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,320
were green

1075
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:17,598
it was just the cio kind of listing in

1076
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,440
and really you know

1077
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,760
not having anything to say just sort of

1078
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,040
multitasking the yellow ones they were

1079
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,760
kind of ready with some sort of

1080
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,679
explanation

1081
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,119
when they were red their entire security

1082
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,119
team was in the room with them or

1083
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,000
virtually with them right why because

1084
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,879
somebody's gonna have to do some

1085
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,879
explaining

1086
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:36,480
um and they it was absolutely necessary

1087
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,000
that somebody explained what it was the

1088
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,719
power of color

1089
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,560
is is is there for you right and i tell

1090
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:45,759
you what graphs are good

1091
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,839
graphs are fantastic but graphs require

1092
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,079
context and i'm going to show you a

1093
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:51,679
graph i pulled i stole this shamelessly

1094
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,679
if you're the person i stole it from

1095
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,760
i've already asked you permission but

1096
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:59,680
nobody knows who you are so it's okay

1097
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,599
what if you put this on a dashboard

1098
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,440
let me just stare at this for a second

1099
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,680
vulnerabilities and the vertical

1100
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,280
time on the horizontal you go wow we

1101
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,560
started getting a ton of vulnerabilities

1102
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,920
something happened

1103
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,160
and now we're getting less is that is

1104
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,480
that

1105
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:18,480
is that good is that bad like i don't

1106
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,000
what are we looking at here like what

1107
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,880
what happened at that point right there

1108
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,359
in the middle

1109
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,800
uh what is going on there what does this

1110
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:27,040
all mean

1111
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,720
and so these graphs are cute for

1112
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,160
starting conversations but you had

1113
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,078
better be able to give me the leading

1114
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,440
and trailing indicators for that thing

1115
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:37,920
because it is absolutely not anywhere

1116
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:42,000
near good enough to say hey we're better

1117
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,680
because better why are you better

1118
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,079
are you better because you're awesome

1119
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,399
are you better because

1120
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,000
you did something are you better because

1121
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,560
accidents

1122
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,280
right you have to be able to to be

1123
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,560
better and

1124
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,720
tell somebody why and of course the last

1125
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,920
and final part of this don't fall into

1126
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,040
disrepair

1127
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:06,000
bridges must be maintained and

1128
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,759
that is a very very very very very very

1129
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,880
very important point i want to continue

1130
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,240
to make with you guys

1131
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,160
is that this is important stuff uh

1132
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,759
this is business changing this is career

1133
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,759
changing this this impacts

1134
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,880
budget this impacts people's lives and

1135
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,440
people's abilities

1136
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,320
to to do what they do so don't think

1137
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,480
you're gonna do this

1138
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,480
once automate it and then go away

1139
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,880
because your business changes and if you

1140
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,599
don't change with it

1141
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,640
well um tyrannosaurus rex would like to

1142
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:35,359
talk to you right

1143
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,400
um you don't exist you stop being

1144
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:39,040
relevant

1145
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,720
and because business changes at such a

1146
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,960
rapid pace

1147
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,399
and there's so many variables to it uh

1148
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,240
the economy

1149
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,720
uh good god you know global pandemics uh

1150
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:53,359
whatever right a new ceo comes in you

1151
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,959
get a new cso

1152
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,720
i don't know there's a million different

1153
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,440
things that could happen

1154
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,799
and uh divestitures you know you know

1155
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,320
you buy a bunch of new companies

1156
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,160
consolidations all those things

1157
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,520
so you should always challenge the

1158
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,960
results that you get

1159
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,960
on your dashboards in the things that

1160
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,880
you report against

1161
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,040
the thing the assumptions that you make

1162
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,800
against that strategy

1163
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,800
that the business wants you wants to

1164
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,920
take challenge your

1165
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,480
yourself do is what i'm reporting still

1166
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,920
relevant

1167
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,079
is what i'm reporting showing that i am

1168
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,839
doing the very best that i can and ask

1169
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,920
yourself how can we do better

1170
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,359
what do i need to do to make these

1171
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,119
indicators better

1172
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,720
both from a security perspective like

1173
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:37,040
how do i make the organization better

1174
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,240
and how can i better show this visually

1175
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,119
if i've got somebody in

1176
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,919
in that boardroom there's 10 people in

1177
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,440
that boardroom

1178
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,680
eight of them are nodding along one

1179
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,359
person looks like they could care less

1180
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,640
and one person is completely confused

1181
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,759
you've got two people you've got to win

1182
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,359
over and you've got to figure out what

1183
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,200
it is that they need to see

1184
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,560
to understand what in the world you are

1185
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,480
doing right now

1186
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,480
because if there's two you know there's

1187
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,599
one confused and one descent or one

1188
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,920
completely

1189
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,400
out in left field then you got to figure

1190
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:07,280
out what it is how can you get better

1191
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,240
work on leading indicators you have to

1192
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,720
have those

1193
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,959
and i promise you if you've got really

1194
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,240
good metrics please please please hit me

1195
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,200
up after this

1196
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,040
uh you know on twitter on linkedin

1197
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:23,040
wherever

1198
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:26,000
find a way to get me than the way you

1199
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,839
you show things you the way you present

1200
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,640
i'm very very curious on

1201
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:35,200
how how organizations

1202
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,359
measure how it impacts their budgets how

1203
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,439
it impacts their size particularly right

1204
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,960
now because we're in a really weird time

1205
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,160
for the entire planet

1206
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,680
and you know as we go through this as we

1207
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,879
go through this awkward time and

1208
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,160
security

1209
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,280
uh is victim to the same budgetary

1210
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,839
shortfalls everybody else is

1211
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,720
experiencing

1212
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:56,400
seeing right now unfortunately criminal

1213
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,480
activity did not go down

1214
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:03,520
as many of you have painfully noticed uh

1215
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,599
so this is going to be a problem for us

1216
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,040
you got to demonstrate positive negative

1217
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,240
change to trailing indicators

1218
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:12,400
how do you do the r you know what is

1219
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,078
what is the impact that you're having to

1220
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,880
what is the needle moving

1221
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,920
to better or worse and what is it that's

1222
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,119
moving that needle

1223
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,119
you don't just need to know that you

1224
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,400
went faster on that track that day

1225
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,960
you need to know that it was because of

1226
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,480
an arrow modification or is because

1227
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,839
you know the driver skipped breakfast

1228
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,880
that morning it was a half a kilo

1229
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:31,040
lighter or

1230
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,960
you got different tires or i don't know

1231
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,720
one of a million different things that

1232
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,800
could go wrong

1233
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,399
this is how you get direction this is

1234
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,800
how you figure out whether your

1235
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,880
organization is going in a positive

1236
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,079
or negative direction from a security

1237
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,440
perspective

1238
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,320
this is how you avoid fun and i'm sorry

1239
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,320
elmer but again

1240
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,160
please please avoid fud and please

1241
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,920
please avoid the big scary numbers

1242
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,440
this is it doesn't it does all of us a

1243
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,960
disservice

1244
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,400
and because i think ultimately

1245
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,839
you know people get wise to this your

1246
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,520
boards will get wise to this your

1247
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:05,359
organizations will get wise to this and

1248
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,839
security supports business objectives

1249
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:10,078
your metrics should prove it if they

1250
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:12,480
don't if you can't find a way

1251
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,359
to prove that what your organic security

1252
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,839
organization does

1253
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:18,640
supports your business objectives i

1254
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:20,960
think you're doing it wrong

1255
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,319
i don't think that's a revelation right

1256
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,839
the truth really is

1257
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:26,240
few things are worse than getting a

1258
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:28,640
positive result and not knowing why

1259
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,319
and that i'd rather get a bad result and

1260
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:34,078
know why i got there then get a good

1261
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:36,319
result and have no idea why i got there

1262
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,920
because then you you are afraid you're

1263
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,400
paralyzed because you don't know if you

1264
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,160
make a

1265
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,960
an adjustment if it's going to go up or

1266
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,720
down you no no clue

1267
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,240
and then and uh you know so i'm going to

1268
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,359
leave you guys on that truth right there

1269
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,399
that is probably the thing i want to

1270
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:50,400
