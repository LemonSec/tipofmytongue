everybody that joined this morning

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:51,039
i know first talk on a saturday

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,760
isn't always the most appealing thing

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,840
there

24
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,399
but on the plus side i'm not the person

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,800
that has to talk right after lunch

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,280
so with that uh go ahead and get things

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,399
going here

28
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,400
all right and general that's what we're

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,840
going to cover here and as you probably

30
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,040
saw from the the concept and the

31
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,040
question of what you know are you going

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,360
to be a government role a civilian role

33
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,880
doing research maybe do some hybrid

34
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,960
version of those

35
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,798
uh where i look at what some of the

36
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,960
resources are that are available

37
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,560
if uh you're out there job searching i'm

38
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,919
gonna provide my perspective if someone

39
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,360
has worked with startups large

40
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,119
multinationals

41
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,880
and in different roles with government

42
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,880
from contract to officer

43
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,720
within the military and then we've

44
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,839
focused a little bit more within some of

45
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,119
the government roles and their

46
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,920
requirements

47
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,400
and particularly with dod in the army

48
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,920
and

49
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,079
answering a lot of the most common

50
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,520
questions that i get at conferences i

51
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,158
frequently have people come up with to

52
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,000
me and say hey i know you were in the

53
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,320
military are you still in the military

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,360
or

55
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,758
if i want to get involved with the

56
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,000
government how would i go about that

57
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,159
and this brings together a lot of that

58
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,880
background information

59
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,079
so like any good presenter one of the

60
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,158
first things i wanted to do

61
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,520
is like okay i'm going to be presenting

62
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,719
so it's 99 ways to do something

63
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,478
immediately go to google and

64
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,478
you know maybe i can find a great

65
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,319
presentation or you know a song

66
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,360
something i can riff off of

67
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,238
uh 99 ways to die i didn't think was a

68
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,440
really

69
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,560
good rundown especially if you're

70
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,720
looking at your career you probably

71
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,800
don't want to kill that off

72
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,040
99 ways to leave your lover that

73
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,520
actually only listed five

74
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,799
and so i ended up going well i don't

75
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,640
have something i'm going to have to come

76
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,280
up with different memes and then pull in

77
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,559
other references as we go through there

78
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,560
one thing i'll also throw out i got the

79
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,080
overlay going here so if you do have a

80
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,400
question

81
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,400
go ahead and raise your hand i've got

82
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:53,200

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,200
somewhere um but anyway yeah if you have

84
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,799
a question just uh pipe up and i will be

85
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,359
able to answer that also i've got time

86
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,599
at the end

87
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,640
i'll be able to have additional

88
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,720
conversations

89
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,480
and if needed we can also switch over to

90
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,840
the horncon discord

91
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,200
and follow on there if you've got

92
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,840
specific things that you wanted to go

93
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,319
through

94
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,120
or just more general about the the job

95
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,799
search and some of the resources

96
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,560
of course with any presentation there's

97
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,080
got to be a standard disclaimer

98
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,159
because i do have an affiliation with

99
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,239
the department of defense that's the

100
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,280
official thing they require me to put up

101
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,599
there

102
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,720
also uh you know no animal testing has

103
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,640
occurred in fact

104
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,760
no testing has occurred with this

105
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,760
presentation at all

106
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,879
this first time it's being presented at

107
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,480
a conference

108
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,720
and saturday morning lack of caffeine

109
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,518
you are all the test audience so i

110
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,120
appreciate you

111
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,720
showing up and being able to provide

112
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,760
that

113
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,879
a little background on myself as

114
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,399
mentioned i'm the

115
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,239
president of iwc labs we run info iwc3

116
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,799
it was formerly known as infowarcon it's

117
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,560
started by winschwartow back in 1995.

118
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,480
it's the oldest information warfare and

119
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,280
cyber conflict conference

120
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,879
so we have some of the familiarity with

121
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,959
the challenges that go on in this

122
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,319
virtual environment or switching to

123
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,159
hybrid type conferences

124
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,679
how do we get information out there how

125
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,000
do we provide

126
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,000
new research or facilitate the different

127
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,880
discussions that are happening

128
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,759
that don't get to happen when people

129
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,238
aren't

130
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,079
necessarily there in the same location i

131
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,599
think with most conferences some of the

132
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,960
best conversations or the best

133
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,040
information sharing

134
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,359
they occur at after hours so they occur

135
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,680
in different events

136
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,120
not just during the the presentations

137
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,720
the presentations provide

138
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,680
that foundational piece but then it's

139
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:42,240
the ongoing conversations around that

140
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:45,040
um so the the lobby con if you will

141
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,800
then career hacking that was actually a

142
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,400
village that we started this year

143
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,040
wasn't uh the entirely the same group as

144
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,120
iwc labs but we were part of it

145
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,639
i was the the founder and one of the

146
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,199
village leads but the career hacking

147
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,560
village

148
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,800
if you're not familiar with def con

149
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,000
defcon has multiple areas referred to as

150
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,160
villages

151
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,520
and they focus in on different things

152
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,880
i'll go into

153
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,000
some of the things that we brought

154
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,000
together with that in a few slides here

155
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,440
the sword is the lightning bolt that's

156
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,479
the army cyber

157
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,680
symbol i am a cyber officer within the

158
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,080
army reserves

159
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,360
and the little uh cyborg voodoo doll

160
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,039
it's a

161
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,120
logo i've had for a while and used on

162
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,680
different things just because it's cute

163
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,680
and cuddly

164
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,440
all right so looking a little bit more

165
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,199
at the career hacking village

166
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,680
the career hacking village we got

167
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,960
started different conferences will have

168
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,280
various things

169
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,120
for helping people look at their careers

170
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,880
common things that were there and that

171
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,080
we had to defcon we brought in

172
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,680
resume reviewers career advisors mock

173
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,320
interviews and we scheduled

174
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,680
over multiple days one-on-one meetings

175
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,599
with people so they could get their

176
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,600
resumes reviewed they could get feedback

177
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,560
how to reorganize it what information to

178
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,520
highlight

179
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,919
how a hiring manager or how a recruiter

180
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,919
might look at some of that information

181
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,039
and what they should be bringing forward

182
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,799
so that

183
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,880
they could actually make it through the

184
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,160
different systems in general a lot of

185
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,840
systems start with the

186
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,000
automated scan that's looking for

187
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,239
keywords it gets to a recruiter the

188
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,080
recruiter does some looking at it

189
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,680
and if the hiring manager actually did a

190
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,719
good description or that's a really good

191
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,520
recruiter

192
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,039
uh then good candidates make it through

193
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,000
and then they end up getting into the

194
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,840
hiring manager

195
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,759
or hiring panel going through the

196
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,119
interviews part of the reason we do the

197
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,840
mock interviews

198
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,400
is to give a uh well it's really to give

199
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,280
practice

200
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,400
and we've looked at actually switching

201
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,239
over to

202
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,520
having some games around mock interviews

203
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,880
if you've ever done the

204
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,799
whose slide is anyway a game

205
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,000
at some conferences uh one of the after

206
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,120
hours events

207
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,360
we're also going to be start doing a

208
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,120
an event where it's really whose job is

209
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,039
it anyway giving people the opportunity

210
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,400
to practice getting some weird questions

211
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,120
getting some weird

212
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,239
job requirements the goal being that

213
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,560
when they go

214
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,240
and actually have real interviews

215
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,000
they've had something that was weirder

216
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,199
or was more complex

217
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,199
it was more off the wall and as a result

218
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,720
the candidate is going to be calmer

219
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,240
because they've experienced something

220
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,400
that was more stressful

221
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,360
and if they're calmer they're more

222
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,799
relaxed

223
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,160
they're going to perform better in the

224
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,560
interview and they're going to have a

225
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,319
better likelihood of getting the job

226
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,759
a couple ways to reach out to the folks

227
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,319
in the career hacking village

228
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,599
hacking career and then we have our

229
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,240
youtube channel there

230
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,919
lots of great presentations if you're

231
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,280
new to the cyber security industry or

232
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,440
you're looking at ways

233
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,440
that you might be transitioning from one

234
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,000
role to another or maybe a slightly

235
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,240
different skill

236
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,520
set one of the presentations we have on

237
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,680
the youtube channel

238
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,520
it's looking at the portability of

239
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,960
skills from a barista to a cyber

240
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,318
security expert

241
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,919
and awesome presentation

242
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,759
what it really does is it breaks down

243
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,440
some of the skills looks at

244
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,520
here's the complexities they're dealing

245
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,400
with and how that applies to a different

246
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,318
career field

247
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,479
the ways that it can be explained and

248
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,400
regardless of really whether you're

249
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,960
looking for a different career yourself

250
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,878
or you're

251
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,560
looking at that next job i recommend

252
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,400
taking a look at that

253
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,479
presentation because it provides some

254
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,239
very concrete examples

255
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,919
of how to look at what you're doing

256
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,080
where your what your skills are

257
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,359
and their portability into different

258
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,840
roles and whether it's in the same

259
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,120
organization or a different organization

260
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,958
a lot of times a hiring manager

261
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,760
well it depends the hiring manager or

262
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,359
the technical hiring person may have

263
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,120
an in-depth level of knowledge and be

264
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,159
able to look at different

265
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,040
aspects or skills and automatically make

266
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,279
the connections

267
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,719
for how they would work in the new role

268
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,200
but if you're able to explain it

269
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,839
just in case that hiring panel doesn't

270
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,399
have

271
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,160
the ability to make that connection it

272
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,680
makes it easier and of course making

273
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,719
things easier for people to give you the

274
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,760
job you want

275
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,560
is always a positive so looking

276
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,279
at some of the candidate qualifications

277
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,319
from the hiring perspective

278
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,439
in particular i'm not i'm interested in

279
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,000
somebody that has

280
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,040
the skills or ability to perform a role

281
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,720
but

282
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,959
really i know that skills are going to

283
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,519
atrophy that technology is going to

284
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,599
change

285
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,760
what's the absolute best thing today is

286
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,800
not going to be the best thing tomorrow

287
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,720
so how do we get somebody that's maybe

288
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,640
has awesome skills today or

289
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,760
decent skills but how are they going to

290
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,360
keep up with the changes in the

291
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,720
technology so i'm looking at how they're

292
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,600
maintaining their knowledge what they're

293
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,360
advancing

294
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,440
if they've got deep knowledge or areas

295
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,839
that they really have a big focus in

296
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,200
that might be of interest if that's the

297
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,959
direction the organization

298
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,120
is looking at going in the future or if

299
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:50,000
we're borrowing ideas from that

300
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,519
any coding languages they might have

301
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,200
something

302
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,800
whether it's a coding language or it's a

303
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,120
vendor unique implementation

304
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,800
do they deal with the cisco rule set and

305
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,360
then structure for

306
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,839
creating rules or do they have a

307
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,240
different vendor's

308
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,240
functionality also

309
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,959
how do they speak to the different

310
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,399
groups or can they speak with the

311
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,479
different groups

312
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,320
leadership lawyers or the layman versus

313
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,839
the practitioners i've seen a lot of

314
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,320
really good security practitioners

315
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,200
they they can't explain what they're

316
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,880
doing to

317
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,240
the executives or the people that are

318
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,600
going to be approving financial

319
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,040
decisions

320
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,040
yes we're doing this thing we're

321
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,800
protecting for a reason and that reason

322
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,800
relates to the corporate risk

323
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,319
and here's what that actually means or

324
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,160
here's what it's going to mean in terms

325
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,079
of

326
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,839
in dollar value if we don't spend this

327
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,680
other money to protect that

328
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,120
being able to explain some of that or

329
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,560
being able to understand here's what

330
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,399
these new regulations

331
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,560
mean and here's what the impact could be

332
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,800
on our actual operations

333
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,399
the eff organization they provide lots

334
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,120
of great analysis of things that are out

335
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,560
there

336
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,079
and i've seen many times with the

337
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,760
corporate lawyers they're good at

338
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,359
contract law but they don't understand

339
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,800
what's happening with the technology

340
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,320
laws and what that mean

341
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,680
might mean to the organization so

342
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,640
there's definitely value if a

343
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,319
practitioner

344
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,319
is able to help connect those dots

345
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,319
one of the statements i heard many years

346
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,160
ago and i thought was pretty awesome

347
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,480
it was that all programming languages

348
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,600
are the same really it's only the verbs

349
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,200
that change

350
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,880
and yeah there's uh

351
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,320
there is some truth to that then i think

352
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,560
there's some truth to it now

353
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,320
but that goes back to vendor-specific

354
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,399
implementations or

355
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,360
the organization code is all written in

356
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,600
one language

357
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,360
being able to understand that languages

358
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,360
because the verb does change the

359
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,680
structures do change slightly

360
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,480
but a lot of the approaches that are

361
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,839
happening

362
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,519
whether you're looking at agile

363
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,519
development or something else

364
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,240
that the agile development it's not tied

365
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,880
to a particular language

366
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,800
but the it is it's tied to the process

367
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,639
that's happening with the language

368
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,240
for the people that may have been around

369
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,320
for a few years

370
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,279
uh they might remember having to deal

371
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,040
with cobalt

372
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,720
and cobalt was interesting

373
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,959
uh one of the things that had was

374
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,800
seven-dimensional arrays

375
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,160
i i've ran into a couple people that

376
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,599
said you know they were doing okay and

377
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,719
they tried to sketch out the seven

378
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,240
dimensional array

379
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,839
well you really don't want to do that

380
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,360
especially during the election

381
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,360
year because once you hit that fifth or

382
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,959
sixth dimension you start having the

383
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,560
great old ones showing up

384
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,920
and that's not really great for the

385
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,160
operation of your environment

386
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,760
so looking at conferences how are people

387
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,399
building their skills whenever

388
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,839
people that i've talked with or a

389
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,600
candidate and they say hey i go to these

390
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,279
conferences or i go to these things or i

391
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,279
try to watch these videos

392
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,399
and that's how i maintain some of my

393
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,480
skills

394
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,079
a lot of conferences they'll have

395
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,680
different

396
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,519
different themes or different focus some

397
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,160
are regional some are in depth around a

398
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,399
particular topic ai for example

399
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,240
others will have different focus areas

400
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,040
within the conference and so kind of a

401
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,880
different vibe

402
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,519
so frequently interested in what

403
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:05,279
conferences do candidates attend

404
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,880
defcon is one that well 30 000 people

405
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,560
went to it in 2019

406
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,800
180 000 were virtually there this year

407
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,000
so that's a lot of folks but are people

408
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,439
actually going to

409
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,360
see some of the presenters are they

410
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,720
going there to network with people

411
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,399
uh some some combination of above

412
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,920
in these conferences has the candidate

413
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,839
have they presented at a conference have

414
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,360
they helped presented a conference

415
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,079
that shows that they've got original

416
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,120
ideas they've got an ability to get in

417
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,920
front of other people

418
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,760
share those ideas also maybe they've

419
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,399
worked at a conference uh once again

420
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,839
that

421
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,320
conveys information about what's

422
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,000
happening their skills with networking

423
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,760
how well some other people maybe some

424
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,040
senior folks in the industry trust this

425
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,959
person because somebody helped bring

426
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,279
them on board

427
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,479
looking at and already talked about you

428
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:54,320
know what they've actually learned from

429
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,320
it and what parts they most enjoyed

430
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:04,319
okay a lot of times things we're seeing

431
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,839
within candidates and people in their

432
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,240
skill progression

433
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,680
a lot of times the technology is

434
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,839
changing or the person role

435
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,120
person's role is changing within the

436
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,399
military people

437
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,040
particularly officers they'll get

438
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,440
assigned to a unit or in a role

439
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,040
and they'll be there for two years

440
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,880
that's oftentimes the first time they

441
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,880
were actually in that role

442
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,160
so over the two years they go out there

443
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,920
they

444
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,279
figure out all the nuances they had some

445
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,439
training and background to be able to go

446
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,320
do things before they got there

447
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,639
figured out probably left with awesome

448
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,279
skills awesome ability to do that thing

449
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:42,320
and then they continue to expand their

450
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:45,680
talent set by moving on to the next role

451
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,959
well what happens uh then

452
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,800
so we're seeing people that are changing

453
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,599
jobs within the military but also in the

454
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,279
corporate world

455
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,720
sometimes it's an employer change or

456
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,160
it's a role change within the same

457
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,240
organization

458
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,160
it's not uncommon to see the employer

459
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,199
changes especially tied with a role

460
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,959
change

461
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,240
not every organization does great with

462
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,560
their talent management

463
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,079
and so some of the most talented folks

464
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,599
that are out there learning and they're

465
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,560
researching they have that ability to

466
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,000
move forward

467
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,279
they're going to jump employers they're

468
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,639
going to bring their skills somewhere

469
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,360
else it gets them

470
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,519
the ability to do something where

471
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,000
they're not pigeonholed or just tied in

472
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,720
because

473
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,800
they had a starting role previously and

474
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,880
now they're moving to a more senior role

475
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,880
and many times it's also tied with a

476
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,839
leap in salary so that makes sense

477
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,519
a common variant they at least used to

478
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,360
occur in the industry and it's still

479
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,959
it's fairly common if somebody comes in

480
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,360
they start as a help desk maybe they're

481
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:39,040
working part-time while in college

482
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,199
then they move into assisted men type

483
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,120
role or network admin

484
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,959
become a deep expert in an area maybe

485
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,160
moving to blue team red team

486
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,758
across their their different functions

487
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,279
but over time people are probably going

488
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,920
to have some deep skills in a particular

489
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,399
area

490
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,079
or they're going to have broad skills

491
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,639
across multiple areas and

492
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,160
that goes into the generalizing

493
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,160
specialist

494
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,600
concept where people have really deep

495
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,279
skills in one area but they've got that

496
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,360
broader understanding and sometimes that

497
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,880
broader understanding going back

498
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,480
to dealing with the executives or the

499
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,920
lawyers i understand all these things

500
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,360
that are happening in cyber security

501
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,680
understand why they're happening

502
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,800
i understand the possible legal aspects

503
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,439
the corporate risk ass

504
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,479
risk aspects and because of that i can

505
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,240
then explain

506
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,240
what we're doing and what we need to be

507
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,120
able to do in the future

508
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,800
so that we remain competitive

509
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,560
unfortunately a few cyber security folks

510
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,079
or would say a significant number

511
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,758
tend to look at we need to do all these

512
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,560
things because that's the absolute best

513
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,600
way to secure

514
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:41,359
our network well it really becomes about

515
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,920
managing risk um the executives will

516
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,279
will often look at well i if i if this

517
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,079
happens i'm going to have a

518
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,199
50 000 penalty i have to pay and why

519
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,239
should i spend 100

520
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:54,000
dollars on it well perhaps because that

521
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,000
uh hundred thousand dollars is going to

522
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,279
offset paying that penalty three times

523
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,680
and oh by the way

524
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,360
uh the balance sheet has organizational

525
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,280
risk is one of the things there

526
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,640
so being aware of those factors

527
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,559
it helps explain things maybe get the

528
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,240
resources that are needed

529
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,599
typically when i was looking at

530
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,120
candidates that would come across i

531
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,399
ended up grouping them into one of four

532
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,280
different areas

533
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,720
and those areas were people that were

534
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,000
presently in their role

535
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,240
they were maybe they were previously

536
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,760
in the role that we're hiring for uh

537
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,280
people that maybe had the potential to

538
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,720
move up into that and people are

539
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,280
probably not the fit but each of those

540
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,679
had a little bit different level of risk

541
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,799
some of the folks if they did the role

542
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,840
previously

543
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:40,480
well maybe it was four years ago and

544
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,159
what worked then is not the best example

545
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,440
of of what's going to work now so there

546
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,559
is that risk that they're going to move

547
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,640
backwards we're going to take the

548
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,760
organization backward because the best

549
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,039
things in terms of

550
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,840
technology implementation and processes

551
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,879
aren't necessarily the same if they're

552
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,399
in the role right now

553
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,120
great i can leverage their their current

554
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,720
knowledge

555
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,399
but i then i'm going to be looking for a

556
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,919
person that's also maybe

557
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,400
doing things to continue to educate

558
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,840
themselves bring themselves forward

559
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,360
people that has the potential to do the

560
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,678
role that maybe somebody that's moving

561
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,799
up

562
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,480
in the organization or their skill set

563
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,840
there's a possibility because they

564
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,960
haven't done it before that there's

565
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,399
going to be

566
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,400
some failures looking at it where i'm

567
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,160
maybe moving in towards a devops type

568
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,960
direction well i want to have lots of

569
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,720
small steps lots of small successes

570
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,559
so that if i do have a failure it's just

571
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,960
a small step backwards

572
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,559
for me personally i i typically look at

573
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,360
folks that have that potential to be the

574
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,240
role

575
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,719
and then i'll also touch on real quick

576
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,480
the

577
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,080
the bottom there is they're probably not

578
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,559
a fit they might

579
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,918
be able to learn the role but it's going

580
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,559
to probably take a quite a while for

581
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,120
that so

582
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,000
if i'm looking at somebody that i might

583
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,678
consider

584
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,120
it's one i don't have a lot of

585
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,880
candidates for that position it's

586
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,959
probably a more junior position

587
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,559
it's the person that taken a few classes

588
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,400
they did a boot camp

589
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,399
they've got an idea for how the things

590
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,520
work maybe they're working some stuff in

591
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,880
their environment

592
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:12,080
and uh in you know working on the

593
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,600
their home home lab and yeah they they

594
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,120
might be a fit for this role

595
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,120
but i understand i'm going to have to

596
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,600
invest in them and i may have to

597
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,959
spend the first two weeks or a month

598
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,399
getting them up to speed on how the

599
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,840
organization works or how this

600
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,039
technology is working within the

601
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,159
organization

602
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:30,559
and be able to to build them up so

603
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,120
uh with those uh are sometimes referred

604
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:36,080
to as the moulin rouge test where

605
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:39,439
can diamonds are are the hiring

606
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,918
manager's best friend

607
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,120
all right so looking at what's happening

608
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,960
why are some people

609
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,000
going towards the federal environment

610
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,960
there's the uncommon mix of technology

611
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,320
a lot of i'll say healthcare maybe has

612
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,240
some of the same where they've got some

613
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,918
of the older technology that's out there

614
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,919
as well as some of the newer things they

615
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,000
have legacy systems

616
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,320
i've seen things within the government

617
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,080
and back from the area the jinko jeans

618
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,678
and motorola star tax

619
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,199
there's some technology that's still in

620
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,039
use but

621
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,960
also the same organizations they're

622
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,240
dealing with massive data sets acquired

623
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,320
globally

624
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,360
have ai analysis that are happening with

625
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,720
that

626
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,080
within the the government in particular

627
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,240
dod you're going to have some

628
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,639
weird network architectures not

629
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,480
everything's terrestrial fiber

630
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,880
maybe you're going to see that in some

631
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,440
other r d organizations or

632
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,120
with researchers that are working out in

633
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,280
the wilderness but you end up having a

634
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,439
uh satellite or lasers the free space

635
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,480
optics and things called troposcatter

636
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,679
where you're

637
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,640
doing your big data shots where it's

638
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,960
reflecting off the troposphere

639
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,320
it's no longer the low latency high

640
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,799
bandwidth that you have

641
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,320
that are happening within most

642
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,760
corporations

643
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,840
if you're dealing with a global

644
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,158
corporation where you have transatlantic

645
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,840
cables yeah there's a little bit more

646
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,200
latency that's happening in there even

647
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,600
though that is

648
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,120
high bandwidth and fairly high speed

649
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,000
just because you're getting the distance

650
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,600
and anytime you

651
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,280
have satellite communications in an

652
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,760
organization and that adds up

653
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,480
to latency issues well why is that

654
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,960
important

655
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,720
i've seen a lot of software and whether

656
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,240
it's security software or networking

657
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,880
software other things

658
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,559
that don't expect the delays that the

659
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,640
additional latency causes

660
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,960
and that may cause failures within

661
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,400
what's in within those tools or within

662
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,320
the ability to look at what's happening

663
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,159
on the network

664
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,080
another thing that the federal

665
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,559
environment typically has

666
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,799
and it's a real challenge is some of the

667
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,879
the legacy acquisition

668
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,320
the military had i would say it was a

669
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,159
15-year cycle where things were

670
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,720
identified and they're procurable okay

671
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,240
great

672
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,080
if it's taking six months to procure

673
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,240
technology you're

674
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,280
probably outdated by the time that you

675
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,200
have it so

676
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,960
with army futures command with our

677
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,960
different organizations there's

678
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,640
more of an ability to work with industry

679
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,840
see what's out there

680
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,720
and acquire it bring things in and

681
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,399
i think there's more of the rather than

682
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,480
spending

683
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,679
tremendous amounts of money to do

684
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,039
maintenance on

685
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,120
networking equipment or things that

686
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,200
should have been retired a few years ago

687
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,439
maybe there's more of an ability to go

688
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,480
ahead and acquire those things and bring

689
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,720
them in

690
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,360
i have to have the the mandatory picture

691
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,760
of sharks with laser beams

692
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,039
the one at the bottom there is just a

693
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,600
fun twitter image

694
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,720
but the the top one there actually was a

695
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,559
researcher or

696
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:38,080
person dod but provided

697
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:39,360
mounts to attach things to shark fins as

698
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,678
supporting oceanographers in their

699
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,959
research and they did attach

700
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,799
a laser beam to a shark so i've

701
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,000
not been able to requisition one of

702
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,280
those i'm hoping to

703
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,240
get one in the next couple months

704
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,760
because it seems really really cool

705
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,679
also i want to touch on whether there's

706
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,120
more more than two networks in one

707
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,520
location

708
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,799
let me get an example a little bit there

709
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,960
on the left hand side

710
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,559
so you may have multiple networks at

711
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,679
different classification levels that are

712
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,678
supporting people so it's one thing

713
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,240
you've got one user one computer

714
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,080
and and one network uh we'll multiply

715
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,320
that by two or five

716
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,000
and you've got these ones operating at

717
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,120
different classification levels you may

718
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,360
have a completely open

719
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:24,000
unclassified network you may have a

720
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,439
a network that's got some restrictions

721
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,799
but it's shared with international

722
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,400
partners so

723
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:31,600
it's a variant of secret or it's a

724
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,320
variant of what's happening on the

725
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,678
unclassified network

726
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:40,960
definitely adds a layer of complexity

727
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,480
within what's happening into a normal

728
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,640
corporate environment

729
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,039
and the i guess the interesting thing

730
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,200
the uh strategic backhoe that can cut

731
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,120
the cable going into a building and

732
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,279
damage all the networks at the same time

733
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,080
becomes even more of a concern

734
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:57,039
but within the government uh there's

735
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,960
several different

736
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,080
types of roles that you're going to

737
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,760
encounter

738
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,439
the most common you'll hear is the gs

739
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,240
it's the government service role

740
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,760
it's they cover everything from entry

741
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,360
level to senior management

742
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,080
everything from the forest service to

743
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,360
dod many many different agencies you'll

744
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,879
hear of an ses

745
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,080
senior executive service those are the

746
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:21,120
c-level executives

747
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,678
those are much rarer to come across

748
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,199
and they do have the same authorities

749
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,200
and the military

750
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,240
often they're compared to they've got a

751
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,880
general officer

752
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,080
level authority and influence within the

753
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,520
military the structure

754
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,799
is enlisted the uh people that uh

755
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,440
they enlist they go through basic

756
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:42,799
training and uh they they form the

757
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,000
common pool of soldiers as part of the

758
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:47,039
enlisted a subset

759
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,159
is the non-commissioned officers so e5s

760
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,960
and above

761
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:53,200
and within the enlisted it starts out

762
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,799
you have e1 e2 e3 45

763
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,159
up to e9 as people gain additional ranks

764
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,158
the different services have different

765
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,240
titles for those

766
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,480
also most of the services they have what

767
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,200
are called warrant officers those

768
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,080
are people that have very deep technical

769
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,720
knowledge

770
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,918
they're not focused as much on

771
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,000
leadership

772
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,520
and leading organizations although they

773
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,440
certainly do that

774
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,279
but it's the deep technical knowledge

775
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,039
within different areas i think

776
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,960
within cyber we're going to see more

777
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,240
growth within the warrant officers

778
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,240
in the commissioned officers the

779
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,679
commissioned officers are focused on

780
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,120
leading and developing there will be the

781
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,600
the commanding officer or there'll be

782
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,399
staff

783
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,199
officers and certainly within the army

784
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,240
cyber

785
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,039
there's a large number of officers that

786
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,440
are bringing

787
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,640
different skills from the industry out

788
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,240
there

789
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,760
uh within the intelligence community

790
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,840
there'll be the three letter agencies

791
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,559
they've got some uh variation

792
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,240
of what's happening uh within let's say

793
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,279
the gs or how they're approaching the

794
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,480
ses roles

795
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,480
and if you start looking more in that

796
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,440
direction you can get different

797
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,440
information around that

798
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,158
so a few things i touched on here we're

799
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,840
dealing with different aspects of

800
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,360
critical infrastructure

801
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,120
an advantage of things that you get in

802
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,799
the government that you can't do in the

803
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,360
corporate world sometimes you get to do

804
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:15,679
the offensive actions or maybe the

805
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,279
enhanced red team type capabilities that

806
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,799
you couldn't legally do in the civilian

807
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,520
world so that seems pretty

808
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,879
complex also you're going to be working

809
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,400
probably more with the defense of the

810
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,400
national laboratories and research

811
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,440
that's happening out there

812
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,640
and it's one of the the fun things

813
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,520
occasionally you get to jump out of

814
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:36,640
airplanes or or blow things up

815
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:39,360
as a cyber officer that's in command

816
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,279
i've got global communications networks

817
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,840
i also have automatic grenade launchers

818
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,919
so

819
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,720
that that's kind of cool for a little

820
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,840
different to do on the weekend

821
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,919
if you're dealing with the government

822
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,439
organizations typically you're going to

823
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,960
have to get a security clearance

824
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,960
a security clearance that's federal

825
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,400
requirements it's not state

826
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,400
and so as states have been going through

827
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,960
they've been legalizing marijuana

828
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,720
and another state just started looking

829
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,279
at legalizing magic mushrooms those

830
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,240
things could be disqualifying to get

831
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:09,360
declarance most cyber related positions

832
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,840
are going to require top secret

833
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,799
clearance

834
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,240
typically takes six months to a year and

835
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,158
a half to get the investigation

836
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,440
and then the adjudication the review of

837
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,880
all the information

838
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,640
as part of that investigation they're

839
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,559
going to be doing different checks

840
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,080
different background interviews seeing

841
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,840
is this a person that should have a

842
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,639
position of trust and access to

843
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,240
different

844
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,840
systems there is a

845
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,279
new thing that the government is able to

846
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,399
do in particular dod

847
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,799
it's the highly qualified expert people

848
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:40,959
getting

849
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:41,600
hired in with very senior skills or very

850
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,360
niche

851
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:47,279
in-depth skills and being able to

852
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,039
enhance what's happening out there the

853
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,880
the mentor leading training

854
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,480
those type of roles that aren't

855
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,399
available and what's typically growing

856
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,399
through the government organizations

857
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,600
so they can be hired directly into the

858
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,760
senior roles

859
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,879
now what's interesting is that there is

860
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,320
a time limit

861
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,200
typically they're one to two year

862
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,559
engagements you can go out to five years

863
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,919
but a lot of times if you're bringing in

864
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,279
that expert they've got that deep

865
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,720
knowledge in an area

866
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,640
probably don't want them for more than

867
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,320
two years because they need to keep

868
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,240
going out and seeing new things

869
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,600
and as part of their career progression

870
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,080
they're going to want to continue to

871
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,158
experience new things

872
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,439
if you keep them in an organization for

873
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,679
five years

874
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,880
that's not going to have the development

875
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,760
not going to have the growth that's

876
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,919
really needed

877
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,158
and ultimately it ends up hindering the

878
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,120
organization you get diminishing returns

879
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,320
probably after that

880
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,360
two-year mark in terms of your

881
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:39,678
development so within the military

882
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,399
the little advertising slide they've got

883
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,720
from the

884
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,000
cyber corps i've got information on the

885
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,640
direct commissioning program

886
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,440
in terms of links at the end of the

887
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,679
presentation

888
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,039
so that's available if you want to take

889
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,120
more of a look at it

890
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:55,039
but what's really happening within the

891
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,760
direct commissioning program

892
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,559
they've got six different requirements

893
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,240
and

894
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,600
looking at that so the united states

895
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,000
citizen

896
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,918
a few people have dual citizenship so

897
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,880
that is a

898
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,200
something that would need to get

899
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,039
resolved and

900
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,440
not everybody has the the four-year

901
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,720
degree i think there may be some waivers

902
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,200
that could happen

903
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,399
if somebody is a publisher or deep

904
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,679
expert in the field but maybe in that

905
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:22,080
case they're looking at going

906
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,720
the highly qualified expert direction

907
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,399
i've

908
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,000
talked to various people that went

909
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:29,840
through this program

910
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:33,440
one was a phd from mit

911
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:37,360
and very impressive skills

912
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:40,399
and and they're doing some awesome stuff

913
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,158
but most folks wouldn't consider

914
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,279
you know where's an mit phd going to go

915
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,640
well they're going to go into a large

916
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,760
corporation they're going to go into a

917
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,640
startup they're going to go to these

918
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,360
things

919
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,919
but this person decided to go in into

920
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,760
the

921
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,880
army cyber with the direct commissioning

922
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,720
program because it provided the

923
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,520
opportunity to go in

924
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,159
see some things touch some things deal

925
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,639
with

926
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,559
maybe an organization that isn't fully

927
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,600
embedded with

928
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,399
devops or devsecops and completely fast

929
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,399
moving

930
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:10,080
and help make those changes and help

931
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,840
shape things for the future

932
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,678
all while helping do things to make

933
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:17,199
their country more safer

934
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,200
and and more competitive

935
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,760
well what happens if somebody goes

936
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:24,000
through the direct commissioning program

937
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,440
well if they get selected for it they're

938
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,720
going to go in they're going to

939
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,760
have about well six weeks and then two

940
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,520
weeks of training

941
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,799
and then there there's also options as

942
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,520
they're going in whether going active

943
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,240
duty

944
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,760
national guard or reserve just to

945
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,640
provide some background so the active

946
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,120
duty that's the

947
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,080
traditional full-time military and the

948
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,559
national guard

949
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,520
they belong to the states some of the

950
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,440
different states

951
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,559
whether it's in the army side or their

952
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,159
air force side

953
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:53,840
they've got the individual states may

954
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:57,760
have some very deep uh

955
00:30:53,840 --> 00:31:01,039
capabilities within cyber operations

956
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,559
and then the reserve it is a another

957
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:06,799
federal service

958
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:09,678
they are army and they they're the uh

959
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:12,639
one week in a month two weeks a year but

960
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:14,720
cyber is in high demand i frequently see

961
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,480
uh requests for people to come on orders

962
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:20,000
to be able to support different things

963
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,679
or maybe support other federal agencies

964
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,440
providing additional clarification on

965
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,640
the national guard trucks they're

966
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,120
they're located in the states and they

967
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,519
belong to the states so they are not

968
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,559
federal service members they can be

969
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,559
federalized

970
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:34,158
but on any given day any week any month

971
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,720
they belong to the state

972
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,080
and it's uh they're ultimately working

973
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,919
for the governor and the leadership in

974
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,799
the citizens of that state

975
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,919
versus the active duty and reserve they

976
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,120
ultimately report up to the

977
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,240
commander-in-chief

978
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:52,000
the president and they are

979
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,000
working under federal regulations

980
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,880
all right so one of the things that

981
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,639
is first of all you know what why have i

982
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,159
stayed in or why have i done the reserve

983
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,240
thing well i've been able to do that

984
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,679
reserve career i've seen whenever the

985
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,679
civilian world gets

986
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,000
some stuff might be stagnating or things

987
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,080
aren't that exciting or there's really

988
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,760
some amazing stuff that's happening out

989
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,639
there in the federal space i can switch

990
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,240
over

991
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:21,200
to my military role probably

992
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,080
get an active duty for operational

993
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,919
support

994
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,519
uh do a deployment essentially becoming

995
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:29,519
a full-time military

996
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:32,559
for six months a year two years and

997
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:35,440
help really with national problems

998
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:36,480
that are out there and after a while i

999
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,480
may get reminded of

1000
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,760
yeah this is uh some of the bureaucracy

1001
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,679
or the things that i got

1002
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,799
annoyed with dealing with this full-time

1003
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,159
and that's why i switch back to the

1004
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,960
reserve so i can switch back to the

1005
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,320
reserve

1006
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:51,919
partial time type role and

1007
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,279
return to the civilian world so

1008
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,519
there's a concern i often hear it's like

1009
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:57,519
well what happens if somebody is a

1010
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,159
reservist and they're mobilized

1011
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,120
there is a u.s era it's a law out there

1012
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,279
it requires

1013
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,678
for the most part that civilian

1014
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:07,760
employers hire their

1015
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,760
reservists back or they put them back in

1016
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,000
the same role i'm not going to go into

1017
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,360
the

1018
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,440
the details around it but the most

1019
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,479
the shortest version is that you're

1020
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,000
going to be protected

1021
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,679
you're going to be able to get your old

1022
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,480
job back and

1023
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,159
you're going to be able to have at least

1024
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,720
six months in your previous career

1025
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,240
once you leave the military service i

1026
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,559
did talk a little bit about the call-ups

1027
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,000
there

1028
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:33,600
where frequently we're seeing other

1029
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,120
organizations uh

1030
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,039
you know asking for support or

1031
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,719
coordination being able to work with the

1032
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,158
different federal agencies as seen at

1033
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,840
dhs

1034
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,360
as we look at what's happening around

1035
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,360
election security you probably heard

1036
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,399
about different nations that are trying

1037
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,080
to tamper in the u.s

1038
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:53,518
elections so being able to help

1039
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,080
federal agencies i think is a a great

1040
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,399
benefit

1041
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,320
and i certainly want to have an election

1042
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:01,518
that's not manipulated by

1043
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:05,039
foreign nations seeking to influence

1044
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:07,360
who our leadership is or disrupt the

1045
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,280
american government one of the

1046
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,279
organizations that supports us out there

1047
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,079
is the mcpa the military cyber

1048
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,960
professionals

1049
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,159
association and this has a link to some

1050
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,720
of their

1051
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,720
ongoing

1052
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,319
educational series that they provide i

1053
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,720
think it's a good way to help understand

1054
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,040
what's going on in government out there

1055
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:29,520
with that you're able to see whether

1056
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,119
it's deputy secretary senior executives

1057
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,599
researchers folks from industry and

1058
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,000
government that happens every tuesday at

1059
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,720

to take a look and maybe learn more if

1063
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,280
you want to

1064
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,399
look at putting in an application for

1065
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,560
for those

1066
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,000
and these slides will be available later

1067
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,320
and the reserves has a

1068
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,359
the cyber protection brigade and i may

1069
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,720
have some of their people that are

1070

1115
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,480

1116
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,680
opportunities for folks yes covet broke

1117
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,280
a lot of things

1118
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,799
but it it also broke a lot of the

1119
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,359
restrictions before

1120
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,800

every conference

1122
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,000

1123
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,879
this hybrid mode or they're going to the
