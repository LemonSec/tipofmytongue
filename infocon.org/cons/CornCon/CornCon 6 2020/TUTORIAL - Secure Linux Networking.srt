1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:07,279
guard it also covers

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:10,320
using curl um i'm in the middle of

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,320
finishing up a cheat sheet for the

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,400
different commands you can use for use

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,720
curl for

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,720
some of the things you can use curl for

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,640
go and start here

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:26,160
so i'm a dual certified

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:29,119
linux administrator um i passed the

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,119
linux engineer

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,040
the first test and i'm taking the next

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,399
one on the 16th

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:41,120
so um i've been studying linux for

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,120
eight years now so

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,480
the different ways that you can contact

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,920
me i'm going to post my slides on my

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,319
gitlab

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,199
um you can contact me on telegram or

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,199
twitter as well

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:04,239
here's a few different um like community

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,920
rooms that i found um

22
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,720
beneficial sec dsm is a group

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,200
it's based out of des moines but there's

24
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,560
a couple hundred

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,840
different participants in that

26
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,880
and central iowa log is

27
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,080
the linux user group

28
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,000
for iowa

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,360
everything i do on here is going to be

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,400
based off of

31
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,880
parrot linux which is a debian

32
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,880
variant

33
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:44,479
so there are a couple extra um

34
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,479
web-based irc channels as well

35
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:53,680
okay so the different things that curl

36
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:57,680
can utilize you can utilize

37
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,640
you can force it to use ssl

38
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,000
more so tls because it's more secure

39
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,759
median

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,878
and you can force different protocols so

41
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,840
i'm going to show you how to use curled

42
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,120
to use

43
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,560
tls 1.3 which is

44
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,560
the latest and mostly here

45
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:24,319
i'm also going to cover sax4 sax5

46
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,200
and i p which is a

47
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,200
http

48
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,200
proxy okay

49
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:44,239
so there's a lot of issues

50
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:48,160
um i work for an isp and

51
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:52,080
i found that most people trust google

52
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:54,400
where um i found

53
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,920
they're not so ethical when it comes to

54
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,959
a lot of their stuff so

55
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,839
i like to use um either movad

56
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:05,680
or open neck um they're both open source

57
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,879
alternatives

58
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:12,959
wikileaks did a audit a while back

59
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:19,280
and they named open nick the most

60
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:22,560
trustworthy dns so

61
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:26,400
these are the latest movad dns servers

62
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,400
so second one here expired

63
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,840
so these are the the parrot opennic

64
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,840
servers

65
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,360
and like i said i'm going to post all

66
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:46,399
these slides with all the content

67
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:48,720
my gitlab

68
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,440
so there's the latest ones um like i

69
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,319
said

70
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,439
wikileaks audited that and they found

71
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,760
that

72
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,760
um

73
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,599
open dns they were actually modifying

74
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,798
the traffic

75
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,238
and stuff like that whereas opennic was

76
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,959
one of the ones that

77
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,080
they they don't do blogging it's done by

78
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:15,840
trustworthy people

79
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,840
done by activists

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,960
okay so um when you're connecting

81
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,919
this is kind of not in the correct order

82
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,680
here but

83
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,599
um when you're there's two different

84
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,840
ways that you can set up

85
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,880
openvpn you can set it up through the

86
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,000
mob movad

87
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,880
app or you can set up through network

88
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,880
manager

89
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:41,520
so when you're importing the certificate

90
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,479
you can specify these different options

91
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,240
either through

92
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:49,520
the gui or through the cli like

93
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,479
the terminal so these are some

94
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,680
options that i turned off for modified

95
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,440
as you can see

96
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:01,759
specified specific

97
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:04,400
dns i don't want i ipv6

98
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,440
to automatically get assigned i don't

99
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,440
want to auto connect

100
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,840
etc

101
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:23,280
okay so like i mentioned before

102
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:25,758
i use a parrot linux and

103
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,320
about a year ago maybe a year and a half

104
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,240
ago

105
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,440
they integrated something called fire

106
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,639
jail

107
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,719
into like the core foundation of the

108
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:39,039
operating system

109
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:42,160
so fire jail is a setcomp

110
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,800
system call sandbox and

111
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,800
restriction

112
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:53,039
program it's all written in c

113
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:58,318
it also integrates namespaces in with it

114
00:05:53,039 --> 00:06:00,000
app armor overlays

115
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,160
all kinds of stuff it's pretty

116
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,400
incredible when it's really easy to use

117
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,400
too

118
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,840
um

119
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:14,000
so here's some more features of it

120
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,120
so you can restrict the capabilities of

121
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,919
processes

122
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,440
you can restrict uh the reason why i'm

123
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:23,359
using in this instance

124
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,360
is because you can restrict the dns

125
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,919
so

126
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:37,520
this is the fire jail gui so

127
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:49,840
uh in this instance here yeah we'll

128
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:49,840
go ahead and do full screen

129
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:05,120
okay so this is fire tools

130
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,758
um the fire gel gui so right here i'm

131
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,800
i'm choosing i want to restrict the the

132
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,000
home folder

133
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,960
i want to restrict dev so

134
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,160
hardware devices aren't going to they're

135
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,599
going to be isolated

136
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,400
from anything that happens in that

137
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,599
sandbox

138
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:28,159
instance i'm also restricting

139
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,159
the mount space and the temporary folder

140
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,599
specifically though the reason why i

141
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,960
chose this

142
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:38,159
is because you can restrict the dns so

143
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:41,919
i'm choosing only query these dns

144
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:45,039
providers and you can also

145
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,080
specify what network protocol you want

146
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,440
to use

147
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:52,639
so normally everything's trying to

148
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,199
switch over to ipv6 but i found

149
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,879
a lot of audits to be very troubling so

150
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,840
i always turn off

151
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,840
ipv6

152
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,199
okay so

153
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,879
can you guys hear me fine just making

154
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,879
sure

155
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:30,800
okay so right here

156
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,280
i'm listing the processes that fire jail

157
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,280
is using

158
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:41,680
and i'm printing the dns

159
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:45,439
so as you can see i'm printing

160
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:48,640
the process id here

161
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,279
and it shows me yes those are the dns

162
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,839
servers that i specified and it's only

163
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,839
using those dns

164
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,839
scrollers

165
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,880
so here it is have a cheat sheet or

166
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,719
template

167
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:09,040
for using curl so curl dlc

168
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:11,680
1.3 pretty sure put a screenshot of

169
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,399
actually doing this but and then you

170
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,519
want to say

171
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,519
ssl required

172
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,800
here's some more interesting things that

173
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,240
carl can do

174
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:26,160
you can grab a headers

175
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:29,279
and trace timestamps and you can see

176
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:32,160
when it actually grabs

177
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,399
of the certificate and if it's valid or

178
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,399
not

179
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:42,000
okay so here are uh the different

180
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:45,040
things that curl can do with

181
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,839
um proxies so the first one

182
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:52,000
is ipv airtight i2p

183
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:55,360
http proxy and i'm grabbing

184
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,279
the developers

185
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:02,880
gpg key here so i'm resolving that

186
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:07,439
through 444 which is

187
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:10,480
an http i2p proxy

188
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:14,000
all right and the next one is tor

189
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:18,800
so i'm using sax5

190
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,959
which is the door based protocol

191
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,439
and the first one i'm grabbing the the

192
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:27,359
developers key

193
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:30,160
and the second one i'm you're checking

194
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,160
if it's connected

195
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,720
okay so here are different ways that you

196
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,839
can print a certificate

197
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,800
to verify that the

198
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,800
certificate is

199
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:50,160
valid so the first one

200
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:53,600
i'm grabbing mobad's uh certificate

201
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:58,839
and i'm printing it out and then i'm

202
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:01,440
piping that to prep to find

203
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,640
sha256 fingerprint

204
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,399
so the second one does the same thing

205
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,160
but the first one is through openness to

206
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:12,240
style the second one's through

207
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,279
shirt tool all right and the last one

208
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,519
here

209
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,560
is uh you're checking the address to

210
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,560
sell start dates

211
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,880
okay

212
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,279
okay so there's two different ways that

213
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,959
you can use

214
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:37,439
uh openvpn you can do side to side

215
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:43,839
um or with the mulvade

216
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,839
they have their own cert so

217
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,240
this is the way you would um create your

218
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,720
own rsa

219
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,720
private key

220
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:02,079
so there's only two

221
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:05,200
vpn providers that address and that's

222
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:09,120
mod and proton

223
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:14,160
vpn but i don't for protons

224
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,160
the stock just moved and wire guard

225
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:21,600
so the reason why i trust movad

226
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,959
is because they seem to be true

227
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:28,720
activists where they talk about

228
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:31,839
vpn is a human right it's not just a

229
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,839
service that they offer

230
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,120
they legally don't have to say these

231
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:41,200
things but they go out of their way

232
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:43,200
to prove that

233
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,440
what they do matters they really believe

234
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,440
in it

235
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,720
so movement has no logging

236
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,000
on any other servers it's all open

237
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,120
source

238
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,639
there's wired support you can always

239
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:06,079
also get it on android

240
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,200
and through f which means it's openly

241
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:11,120
audited

242
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,120
um within the community

243
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,959
all right so right here i'm fetching the

244
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:26,399
mulva gpg keys

245
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:29,439
so i'm fetching it

246
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,959
from the first one through that

247
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,639
sks key server and then i'm saying

248
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,000
what's its fingerprint so that it can

249
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,959
verify that

250
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,959
is the correct gpd key

251
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,760
all right so you can either fetch it

252
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,320
through the key server

253
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:58,560
or you can grab the file

254
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,560
hey zelnets your slides aren't advancing

255
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,839
oh okay

256
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,880
i don't know i didn't do that um

257
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,880
let me go back then

258
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,839
okay can you see him now

259
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,639
can you see my screen now here let me

260
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,639
pull up the chat here

261
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,000
yeah there's all things i see the gbg

262
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,360
keys

263
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,680
screen okay sorry about that

264
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,680
um

265
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,600
so here i'm pulling the gpg key from the

266
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,279
key server

267
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,519
um that's the first command and the

268
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:02,560
second one i'm

269
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,560
printing the fingerprint from molved

270
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,839
um

271
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:27,839
[Music]

272
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,839
what

273
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,160
all right

274
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:44,959
so here i'm grabbing the movad

275
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:48,160
signing key file from the site

276
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,599
and as you can see in the command curl

277
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:57,120
is saying

278
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:57,120
ssl is required and you're outputting it

279
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:09,360
all right so here i'm

280
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:13,440
verifying the movad vpn dev file

281
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:17,199
against the movad gpg signature

282
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:20,240
so gpg signatures um normally end in

283
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,639
dot asc so you're going to want to use

284
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,240
that

285
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,959
file first so you're going to do the asc

286
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,079
file

287
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:31,599
space and the mobadvpn.deb

288
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,920
which is the binary file and as you can

289
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,199
see

290
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,399
it checked it and good signature from

291
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,680
movad

292
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:42,560
using that sub key which is

293
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,560
very found here

294
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,360
okay so well then it has two different

295
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,399
kinds of

296
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,680
servers they have open vpn servers and

297
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,680
they have wireguard servers

298
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,759
so openvpn uses the

299
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:06,720
highest bit for rsa

300
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,720
1496

301
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,240
aes 256.

302
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:18,240
so wolfhead um

303
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:21,199
has put a lot of time into making it as

304
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,160
easy and as efficient to getting up and

305
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,160
running as possible

306
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,039
with the open vpn configuration

307
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,960
generator all you need to do

308
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:38,879
specify the location you want

309
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,880
the os you want to use download the file

310
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,520
and then you want to in that it's going

311
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,240
to have a zip file containing

312
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,440
the certificates your username and

313
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,039
password

314
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,039
and the configuration options

315
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:02,959
so as you can see here

316
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:06,240
i'm copying all those files

317
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,799
to etc open

318
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,799
vpn

319
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:15,840
and it's showing for mostly that they

320
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,840
were copied

321
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:23,120
so i like to

322
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,320
um i like to turn

323
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,760
on the immutable bit for things like

324
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,399
certs and stuff like that

325
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,440
because i imagine if someone were to

326
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,919
hack you

327
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:39,200
and they just replaced a cert

328
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,919
you would you wouldn't have a secure

329
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,919
connection

330
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,840
anymore so you don't want

331
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,600
the ability for them to be able to edit

332
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:52,320
that so when you turn on

333
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,320
the immutable bit that file cannot be

334
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:01,678
changed

335
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,679
okay so here is the movad app

336
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:08,720
and as you can see it's connected

337
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,000
sweden if you go into the settings you

338
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,280
can choose

339
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,320
the tunnel protocol so you're either

340
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,760
going to choose

341
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:21,520
openvpn or wireguard

342
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:24,799
you don't want to use tcp

343
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,879
with openvpn i read a

344
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,080
paper a while back with the people that

345
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,520
created it

346
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,678
and it has all kinds of problems with

347
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,120
tcp i think the packet

348
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,120
is too big

349
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,918
the header is too big or something like

350
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,480
that so they ran into a lot of like

351
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:46,160
crashing and stuff like that with tcp so

352
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,160
always use it with udp

353
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,840
all right

354
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:01,600
and um openvpn

355
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:04,960
both use virtual

356
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:08,559
instances or virtual interfaces

357
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:12,320
that they communicate through so

358
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,320
the way that um

359
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,879
openvpn say if you were to just connect

360
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,879
back to your house

361
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,678
from work or something like that the

362
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,080
certificate is a thing

363
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,200
that kind of binds the connection and

364
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,960
allows them

365
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:34,159
to communicate so they communicate

366
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:38,640
over this virtualized interface

367
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:41,840
which is uh for

368
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:46,640
stocks 5 proxy interface but

369
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:50,879
for openvpn you'll see

370
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,880
whenever you're choosing um

371
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,480
whenever you're choosing the ip you

372
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,600
always want to use

373
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,240
that that ip that virtual instance

374
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,678
and you'll see that when i set up um

375
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:06,240
qubit torrent

376
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,240
later on

377
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,400
all right so here is the section where

378
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,320
like i said before you can either use

379
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,520
the movad app

380
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:22,080
or you can use network manager which is

381
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:26,080
the typical

382
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:30,799
connection manager for linux

383
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:35,120
so what you want to do is import

384
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:38,720
the vpn connection file

385
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:42,559
into network manager

386
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,559
and it basically does everything for you

387
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,840
everything's predefined

388
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,200
all right

389
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,280
all right so

390
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,200
one of the issues you run into with

391
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:05,039
stocks five

392
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:09,200
and mobile with firefox is that it

393
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:12,320
uh it by default

394
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:15,600
enables dns over https

395
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,760
which leaks things to cloudflare

396
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,799
so you want to make sure that you turn

397
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,760
that off

398
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,158
and that you're practicing dns when

399
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,440
using

400
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:28,000
sax5 so

401
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,400
those are screenshots of how you would

402
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,400
do that

403
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:46,080
and those are more verbose instructions

404
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,080
and an actual screenshot of doing

405
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,000
all right so these are the differences

406
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,080
here

407
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,640
between openvpn and wireguard

408
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,120
as you can see here um this one is

409
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,120
connected

410
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:07,280
through openvpn which

411
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:10,959
wireguard has it is multi-hop

412
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,960
by default so

413
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:17,600
you'll get say three wire guard

414
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,360
servers and they run through something

415
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,280
called

416
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:26,799
namespaces so because it has

417
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:30,080
several extra hops if

418
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:33,440
um you know the nsa or

419
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:36,799
someone trying to

420
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,720
um watch your traffic

421
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,879
it's it's much more difficult when it

422
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,440
does extra hops

423
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,919
because you can't find out where it's

424
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:51,840
coming

425
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:51,840
out from so obviously it's the traffic

426
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:58,559
all right so mobad has

427
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,480
you can you can do kill switch either

428
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:04,080
through iptables

429
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:07,279
which is command line terminal

430
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,799
or it just has a button in the app that

431
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,520
does that for you

432
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,520
in the background

433
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,720
so you want to click always require vpn

434
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,360
it'll come up with this message here we

435
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,360
want to say yes

436
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,279
or you can do it through the command

437
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,360
line like this

438
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:33,120
so these are all iptable rules

439
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:36,559
you just throw this into text editor

440
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:39,760
save it run it as a shell script

441
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:42,480
and do

442
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,480
iptables dash l and it'll actually show

443
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,440
these rules

444
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,440
being implemented um the interesting

445
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,640
thing that i found

446
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:57,840
the way he wrote these rules since

447
00:24:52,640 --> 00:25:01,840
mobad is also the dns provider

448
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,840
um he's specifying

449
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:08,720
he's specifying the sword host

450
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,520
so you're gonna block everything that

451
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:15,840
doesn't come

452
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:15,840
from that source host

453
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:28,240
all right so telegram is a messenger

454
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:30,320
it also offers sox5 proxing

455
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,520
so this is how you would go about doing

456
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,279
that

457
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:42,799
go in to connection type

458
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:46,720
choose use custom proxy

459
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:49,840
it will go ahead and fetch that for you

460
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:53,120
and as you can see it's using like a

461
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:57,840
specified before the openvpn

462
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,840
virtual instance interface

463
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,480
once it's connected you'll notice that

464
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:11,600
it goes from

465
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:14,799
tcp to tcp with proxy

466
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:18,559
so i actually do have a video up on my

467
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,559
up on youtube for that

468
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,918
all right so all that has a few

469
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:30,960
different tests

470
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,960
once you connect to it they check for

471
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:37,840
four different things they check

472
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,360
if you know it's coming from their

473
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,480
server

474
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:47,439
is it blacklisted is a

475
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:51,440
webrtc leaking your ip

476
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,440
and other dns leaks

477
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,520
so you can do it through the web front

478
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,120
end like this

479
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,360
or you can do it through the command

480
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,360
line

481
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,799
as well

482
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,840
so there's it expanded more

483
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:17,120
so these are all the um the output from

484
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,320
the terminal running these different

485
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,479
commands

486
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,678
you're checking the ip the city the

487
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,679
country

488
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:28,720
and is it connected um it also has like

489
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,480
a batch test that you do through a json

490
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,840
file

491
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:36,559
so it's going to find um

492
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,760
not only the ip and the country and city

493
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:41,039
and all that stuff

494
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,600
but they go through a geo provider which

495
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,200
actually

496
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,120
tracks down exactly where it's coming

497
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,320
from

498
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:52,879
and they're checking to see here if it's

499
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,879
listed in any of the honeypot projects

500
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:05,679
okay so once i was connected i ran

501
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:10,399
a few different dns leak tests

502
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:13,279
and i think it tried three different

503
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:15,439
um providers and all of them came back

504
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:18,080
with no leaks

505
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,080
all sweden

506
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:26,640
okay so another way that you can connect

507
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:30,320
is through ssh and you

508
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:34,159
create a sax5 proxy back to yourself

509
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:38,879
through a reverse connection using a

510
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,880
reverse ssh tunnel

511
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,960
so if you're being firewalled or you're

512
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,559
doing it from work or something like

513
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,039
that and they're blocking

514
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,080
the ability for you to do that you

515
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,960
should be able to set up this

516
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,360
ssh tunnel and reverse back to proxy

517
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,360
connection

518
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:04,799
all right so cubic torrent is

519
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:08,239
a bittorrent provider um

520
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:12,399
and they explicitly built

521
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,760
qubit torrent for anonymity

522
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:17,360
so these are the these are all the

523
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:22,879
different options here for setting up

524
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,879
the open vpn stocks 5 proxy instance

525
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,399
go through them here so the first one

526
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,600
let me go to the bittorrent it's kind of

527
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:38,640
hard to see that sorry

528
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:41,520
um and check all those options

529
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:44,799
so you don't want to use pure exchange

530
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:47,520
um you want to require encryption

531
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,799
and you want to use the anonymity

532
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,840
protocol

533
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:54,399
that cupid torrent built specifically

534
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:58,720
for

535
00:29:54,399 --> 00:30:02,719
that application all right so here

536
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:06,080
you're choosing the proxy server is sox5

537
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:12,399
you're choosing the the virtual

538
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:16,240
interface which is the 10.801

539
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:18,879
and x5 uses 1080

540
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,880
is the port

541
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:26,000
all right and you want once you apply

542
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,320
everything should go through the stocks

543
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,799
5

544
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,799
proxy

545
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:35,039
all right so cupid torrent also has ip

546
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,720
filters

547
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:41,919
so once you

548
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,919
add the file

549
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,440
you open the file apply it to trackers

550
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,200
and it will show all the different rules

551
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,320
that are applied

552
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:55,520
so to get that file

553
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:59,360
you want to use wget

554
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:03,840
i threw this into the into my gitlab

555
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:07,439
repo so just a one line

556
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:12,000
output and output ipfilter

557
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:14,559
which is just a list of blacklisted

558
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,559
ips

559
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:23,840
okay so these are the wire guard servers

560
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:26,639
um wargard's considered

561
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,639
stable now um for a while they were

562
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:32,000
doing a bunch of different audits on it

563
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:35,120
but i think once linus actually

564
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,559
integrated into the kernel everyone

565
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,039
realized that it's

566
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:42,158
probably one of the most secure

567
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,158
alternatives right now

568
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:52,799
so wireguard um configuration generator

569
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:56,399
is just like the openvpn one

570
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:59,600
um except for you can specify

571
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:02,320
multiple um

572
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,480
exit locations so you can multi-hop with

573
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,480
it

574
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,240
so you'll get you'll connect to the wire

575
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,760
guard

576
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:17,279
the first our guard server

577
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:20,320
and all of these wireyard servers

578
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:23,360
are connected

579
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:27,120
through um network

580
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:31,279
namespace instances so it's

581
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:35,518
pretty similar to like like ssh tongue

582
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:38,880
so everything is

583
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:42,799
completely an anonymity based

584
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:45,919
so they may see you going into

585
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:50,000
one one of the

586
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:53,279
um servers but it's gonna hop

587
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,120
a couple extra times so anyone's

588
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:57,760
watching that even if they're really

589
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,518
good at actually tracking this

590
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,720
after it goes through a couple hops

591
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,840
there's no way they're going to be able

592
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,200
to

593
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,199
you know follow it back

594
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,840
oops

595
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:25,600
all right so wireguard is

596
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:28,960
once you set up the wireguard key

597
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:31,918
which is just a one-line

598
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,840
command once you set it up it's always

599
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:37,200
going to default back to

600
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:40,240
wireguard because it's a much more

601
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,240
secure protocol

602
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,960
and molved has explicitly stated a few

603
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:50,640
times that they

604
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,640
believe wireguard to be the future

605
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:58,719
with quantum cryptography coming um

606
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,720
it's going to be much more resistant

607
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:07,600
so you can regenerate keys through

608
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:10,879
the movad app it's

609
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:14,159
as simple as it can be so

610
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:17,839
that they can do your public key

611
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,839
you hang onto your private key just like

612
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:23,199
gpg

613
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,200
oops

614
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,638
okay so

615
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:35,119
here's how you use curl to go

616
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:39,359
through a i2p site

617
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,359
and fetch the file using

618
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,520
444444 just https time2p

619
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,520
proxy

620
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,839
all right so there were a few a few

621
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:55,280
things that i didn't really have time

622
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:59,839
um to address so

623
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,839
proton vpn is

624
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
another the only other trust for the vpn

625
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,359
provider

626
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,079
i would say um i haven't had a chance to

627
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:11,279
play around with it but um i use

628
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:15,440
protonmail

629
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:19,119
and they seem to be quite legitimate

630
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,119
and what they're doing um

631
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:26,320
chair and ricochet are tour based

632
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,320
um

633
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:34,640
ricochet is a chat a tour chat

634
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,640
so it sets up an onion

635
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:43,520
onion site and then once

636
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,320
you stop communicating it tears down the

637
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,079
onion

638
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:51,359
so same thing with onion chair

639
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:54,720
so it sets up

640
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:55,440
a dark net onion and then transfers the

641
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,040
file

642
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,359
and then tears it down once the file is

643
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:02,880
complete so there's no

644
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:05,040
evidence of anything gnu net is like its

645
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,240
own

646
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:12,079
open source vpn

647
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:14,560
and tink is a mesh vpn so

648
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,640
all very interesting projects just

649
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:20,400
didn't have enough time to

650
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:24,720
cover them so um i will be posting

651
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:27,839
more videos um of all this stuff

652
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,799
on my archive my youtube and my bit

653
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,200
shoot

654
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,200
channels

655
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:35,839
all right um did anyone have any

656
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:41,839
questions

657
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:12,079
all right um assuming that's no

658
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:17,680
so i created a few different cheat

659
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,720
sheets and configurations

660
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:25,040
um i'll give the links to john

661
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,040
and i'll post them on telegram

662
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:36,000
so i created like a curl cheat sheet um

663
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:38,560
a sources list cheat sheet which is like

664
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
debian repositories and stuff like that

665
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:43,759
also

666
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:47,680
a cheat sheet for grabbing the

667
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:50,800
molved gpg key verifying it

668
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,960
and importing it and stuff like that

669
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,960
so

670
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:05,839
all right thank you for your time

671
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,839
oh

672
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:47,839
so

673
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,960
you
