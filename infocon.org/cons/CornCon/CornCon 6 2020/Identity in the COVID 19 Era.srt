strategy

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,400
speaking today on identity in the

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,400
covet era and he's going to have a

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,320
fireside chat with mike coogan who's

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,840
senior director of cyber security at

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,519
waste management

11

in houston so uh bob i'll let you take

12
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,320
this away

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,718
thank you john thanks for the invitation

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,040
to

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,640
present and uh i'm very happy to be here

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,079
with mike coogan

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,719
um let me start by giving you a backdrop

18
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,399
in terms of the the broad environment

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,960
that we're dealing with and i would go

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,120
back to about 10 years ago

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,719
in in a very broad context we've been

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,239
going through

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,800
a broad technology transformation era

24
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,680
uh similar to when when mainframe

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,720
started that just

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,840
changed everything uh

27
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,439
and and there's several aspects of the

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,400
transformation that we're going through

29
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,279
there's

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,000
most large enterprises in the last 10

31
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,759
years

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
have either moved to the cloud or are

33
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,080
moving to the cloud you have

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,680
the number of devices that people have

35
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,119
as rich marshall was saying bring your

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,960
own disaster

37
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:30,159
um so you have um

38
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,439
tablets and smartphones and maybe not so

39
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,920
smartphones and other

40
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:38,240
devices that that are being used

41
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,040
and and there's a number of really good

42
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,600
reasons

43
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,040
to to make the transformation not just

44
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,679
in terms of

45
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,240
bottom line costs but in terms of you

46
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,079
know it's it's a bit of a trite word but

47
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,320
being more agile as a business and being

48
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,960
able to roll out technology

49
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,039
maybe not quite overnight but pretty

50
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,960
close to that

51
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,799
so there's there's a lot of core

52
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,158
business drivers behind that

53
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:08,640
and and at the same time

54
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:11,120
we have a number of changing and and

55
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,440
evolving threats that are happening at

56
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,239
the same time

57
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,680
uh fast forward to this year where the i

58
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,200
don't know if you've experienced it but

59
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,239
there's this little virus issue that's

60
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,760
been going around

61
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:27,040
covet 19. and

62
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,640
in a very short period of time most

63
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,799
enterprises transition

64
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,839
from working in the office to working

65
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,640
from home

66
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:40,640
or making alternative work arrangements

67
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,958
and and so the the impact of that is

68
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,760
a a large percentage of enterprises

69
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,160
simply

70
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,840
uh did not have plans to be able to do

71
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,680
that and it was a little bit rocky

72
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,599
um but but one of the big things that's

73
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,560
come out of that is you're fundamentally

74
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,000
changing the

75
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,519
technology uh architecture and the bad

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,319
boys and girls

77
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,599
uh have understood that you know when

78
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,238
when there's chaos there's an

79
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,200
opportunity

80
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,120
to take advantage so there's a lot of

81
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,040
enterprises that may not necessarily be

82
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,400
protecting people at home as they would

83
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,519
in their offices

84
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,720
uh just just the fundamental change in

85
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:21,120
uh technology uh presents a challenge

86
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,480
and you know rich rich marshall had a

87
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,720
couple of very good things to say

88
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,280
earlier one of them is

89
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,840
you know it's important to do the basics

90
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,080
um

91
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,000
whether it's patching systems giving

92
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,599
people the correct access that

93
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,239
they need and not more and that's

94
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,879
central to identity

95
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,760
when you have uh an environment that's

96
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,798
so fluid

97
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,000
as it is right now all of those basics

98
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,000
become a challenge

99
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,560
and so that's that's the environment

100
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,239
that that we're living in

101
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,920
um mike i'd love to get your perspective

102
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,799
in terms of what's been happening at

103
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,079
wage manage

104
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,840
waste management and uh you know

105
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,519
what's the story in terms of how you

106
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,959
transitioned when

107
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,799
kogan 19 reared its ugly head

108
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,239
it's been very interesting as you likely

109
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,959
know waste management's an

110
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,159
interesting company most of our folks

111
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,080
because we're in the business of

112
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,519
collecting and disposing of waste you

113
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,320
know about half of our folks didn't go

114
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,880
home at all

115
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,639
right they reported to work and we

116
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,120
implemented procedures to keep them safe

117
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,840
and

118
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,800
fingers crossed uh we're moving along as

119
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,320
you can see i'm in

120
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,840
my office now we're actually in the

121
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,800
process of bringing our office-based

122
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,638
folks back

123
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,160
those who need to be in the office to do

124
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,680
work effectively

125
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,360
so we're working i'm here working out

126
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,880
the procedures on how do we do that we

127
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,759
have the appropriate plexiglas shields

128
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,240
do we have

129
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,960
spacing do we have people moving back

130
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,639
and forth

131
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,638
and and how do we do that uh in the

132
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,199
shift remote work like almost every

133
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,160
large organization uh we did it in a

134
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,680
very short time

135
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,680
right we were lucky enough to identify

136
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,720
it you know first second week of march

137
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,600
saying this is going to be a real

138
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,639
problem we need to start

139
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,120
thinking about how we're going to do

140
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,360
this um and and

141
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,120
i would characterize it as you know

142
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,080
anyone who's running it a large

143
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,880
corporation

144
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,479
it's a rapid acceleration of what we

145
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,680
were planning on doing of course we had

146
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,159
plans to roll out

147
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,720
two-factor authentication to our entire

148
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,199
uh

149
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,400
user community right but the act of

150
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,600
taking you know maybe one or two

151
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,758
thousand people working

152
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,960
remotely to tens of thousands of people

153
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,000
working remotely

154
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,719
in the space of one to two weeks uh as

155
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,919
you said

156
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,479
yeah that was uh fits and starts right

157
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,680
we made decisions as fast as we could uh

158
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,159
got them all off

159
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,600
off-site uh and it worked you know much

160
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,720
to our surprise had you asked us to go

161
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,280
figure out how to do that we would have

162
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,360
done

163
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,559
the very traditional uh thing that we do

164
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,880
which is like okay so

165
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,360
here's the 18 month plan where we've got

166
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,440
you know communications and training

167
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,800
and here's how we're going to distribute

168
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,000
the tokens etc

169
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,080
uh we're going to put this group of

170
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,720
people on gdi with this group of people

171
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,240
on vpn and it would be very very

172
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,479
structured very very logical

173
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,240
and of course we simply said you write

174
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,840
documentation and get it out there

175
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,280
you write documentation for our helped

176
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,560
us to deal with this

177
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,559
you know you spin up vdi's you

178
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,240
uh start doing customer service and

179
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,600
taking frontline calls

180
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,400
so it was very very rapid it worked out

181
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,000
uh fairly well and uh from an identity

182
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,719
standpoint we got a couple of really

183
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,319
really big

184
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,080
advantages one of those was we hesitated

185
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,000
in a broad role out of multi-factor

186
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,359
authentication primarily because my team

187
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,360
is fairly small

188
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,880
uh and you know when you've got tens of

189
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,800
thousands of customers

190
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,039
uh you have to be very very supportive

191
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,280
of people and you have to be very very

192
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,039
prepared to take calls for many users

193
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,039
and so we're working through how

194
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,479
are we going to do this this event

195
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,759
forced us to do that

196
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:46,400
right we had no choice um

197
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,919
that was very very powerful for us you

198
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,638
know all of a sudden everybody had the

199
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,719
ability to

200
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,680
that's allowed us to advance our agenda

201
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,919
so quickly on

202
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,680
other cloud systems you know we're not

203
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,960
uh accessing them from the

204
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,840
uh core uh office network any longer

205
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,880
uh it's increased the demand for single

206
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,638
sign-on because as we've

207
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,639
accelerated into the cloud on other

208
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,880
applications uh

209
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,960
you no longer can rely on our old-school

210
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,639
kind of sample integrations that you us

211
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,400
on site or even you know the old

212
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,880
windows authentication transparently

213
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,080
under the cover now you have to

214
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,560
do complex oauth integration to make it

215
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,840
work

216
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,199
uh particularly someone that's not in a

217
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,198
traditional network-connected way

218
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,880
yeah yeah and you know i'd love to

219
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,520
you know when when coven19 hit what was

220
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,400
what was the general conversation

221
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,599
um you know you know you know you know

222
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,318
you need to

223
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,759
make some changes but what was what was

224
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,280
and and i obviously not getting into

225
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,800
details but what was the general theme

226
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,000
in terms of the conversation that you

227
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,520
had in terms of

228
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,520
needing to transition both from a

229
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,120
security identity and

230
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,840
technology perspective a lot of it was

231
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,440
and i'm

232
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,359
proud of the leadership at waste

233
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,719
management here uh

234
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,080
you know as we engineer these things and

235
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,879
we engineered things that you know you

236
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,318
would never

237
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:09,280
ever attempt to do in a day in two days

238
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,639
in three days um leadership was

239
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,119
incredibly supportive

240
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,280
of the effort and on top of it they were

241
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,759
extremely supportive

242
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,840
of you know us making mistakes because

243
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,599
we're just going faster than we had ever

244
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,599
anticipated having to do

245
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,800
in enabling capabilities for people to

246
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,000
continue their work with this little

247
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,319
disruption to people who actually

248
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,319
you know serve as a bill paying customer

249
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,039
who you know make sure that our trucks

250
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,039
are running

251
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:39,120
and and all of those actions uh

252
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:41,039
were supported by our leadership

253
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,560
yeah you know i i think you're you're

254
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,000
fortunate in the sense that

255
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:48,239
um waste management

256
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,440
is for the most part insulated from

257
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,120
economic up

258
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,760
ups and downs because everyone is going

259
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,560
to need their their their waste disposed

260
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,439
of

261
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,160
um unlike the travel industry for

262
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,880
example

263
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,199
that uh you know when you look at hotels

264
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,399
and

265
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,200
airlines and any related uh business

266
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,240
their um their revenue effectively went

267
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,959
to zero or

268
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,000
or really nominal for for a given period

269
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,880
of time

270
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,920
um you know one one of the things that

271
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,080
that we're seeing

272
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,680
and i think it's important to put

273
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,040
yourself into

274
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,279
the ceo's seat right now because

275
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,959
one of the when when kogan 19 hit the

276
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,519
first thing that ceos were

277
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:32,000
looking at is so how much cash do i have

278
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,600
on hand

279
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,399
how do we get from here to

280
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,680
post covet 19 and the goal posts are

281
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,519
moving

282
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,680
regularly right and it's still not clear

283
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,200
to us when we're going to be

284
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,359
out of this mess um

285
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,640
i need to continue to function as a

286
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,519
business

287
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,120
and and in periods like this where

288
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,880
there's uncertainty people get

289
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:02,399
nervous um and and especially

290
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:06,079
in industries that um

291
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:08,000
that had that were severely impacted um

292
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,279
people either may perceive that their

293
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,120
job is at risk

294
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,480
or their job may be at risk and as a

295
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,200
consequence

296
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,720
um the probability of insider threats

297
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,640
goes way up

298
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,880
um i think the the other thing that i

299
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,439
would say in in this period overlaying

300
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,800
that is that most large enterprises

301
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:30,000
have been on gen 1 or gen 2

302
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,120
identity solutions and and making the

303
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,720
transformation

304
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,440
to the environment that we're working on

305
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,839
right now moving to the cloud

306
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,200
is challenging when you have those first

307
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,320
uh couple generation

308
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,519
solutions where it's it's not easy

309
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,320
to provision uh or

310
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,120
or validate or federate uh people that

311
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,200
are going to

312
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,959
a sales force or if you're going to

313
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,160
google pick your favorite

314
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,239
large clown right um

315
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,800
where i'm going with this is that if you

316
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,160
look at the big spends within security

317
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,160
organizations

318
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,800
uh identity is one of them and general

319
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:10,160
security operations is the other one

320
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,680
and and so that that creates a really

321
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,319
good opportunity

322
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,239
to help accelerate the change and core

323
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,760
identity infrastructure

324
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,839
uh as well as um

325
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,000
accelerating everything else is that

326
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,360
what you're seeing mike

327
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,600
we are seeing that but i want to talk

328
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,320
about the the people aspect of this

329
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,360
tragedy

330
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,760
yeah when everybody went home we didn't

331
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,600
know

332
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:37,279
very much at all um i need to log out of

333
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,320
teams probably

334
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,839
we didn't know very much at all

335
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,800
you know many of us went home said okay

336
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,760
we're going to take a two-week break

337
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,279
we're going to flatten the curve and

338
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,640
just we're going to move on right

339
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,079
you know all of a sudden here we are six

340
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,040
months later going how long is this

341
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,760
going to last

342
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,719
um and waste management prides itself

343
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,319
very much on being a

344
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,480
people-first culture you know it's one

345
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,399
of our core values about the people

346
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,680
and our ceo a gentleman by the name of

347
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,800
jim fish

348
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,880
very quickly and i don't remember the

349
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,199
exact timing but it was very quickly in

350
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,200
this

351
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,760
said look we're not going to get through

352
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,279
this by laying off a bunch of people

353
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,639
right what we're going to do is if

354
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,040
you're a driver we're gonna get you

355
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,720
getting

356
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,199
40 hours a week because remember we have

357
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,440
multiple kinds of business right we have

358
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,720
commercial like bars and restaurants and

359
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,680
those kind of things that don't need as

360
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,839
many pickups

361
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:25,920
right as well as our own personal uh

362
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,639
trash um samina said we're not gonna get

363
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,160
through this we're gonna

364
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,600
guarantee we still do performance

365
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,480
management we're gonna do all the right

366
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,079
things there

367
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,760
right that we need to do just to be an

368
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,680
effective operating company

369
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,360
but it's really we're gonna talk about

370
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,800
our people our people will carry us

371
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,600
through this and that's a strategic

372
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,279
advantage

373
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:46,399
yeah um we did see you know as you noted

374
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:49,680
earlier uh an optic an uptick in attacks

375
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,120
as nearly everyone watching this did um

376
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,880
we spent a considerable amount of time

377
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,079
getting visibility you know and i think

378
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,079
that's important from a securities

379
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,439
standpoint when people go offline you

380
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,359
know i was working just on my

381
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,120
home computer for a while right using

382
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,440
college services if you look at what i

383
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,519
do

384
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,959
i talk to people and i send emails i can

385
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,639
do that anywhere i can do it off

386
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,518
you know little i device i've got here

387
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,600
right um

388
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,720
and so how do you get the education out

389
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,480
to them how do you

390
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,480
uh make sure they understand how to

391
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,440
protect things so we wrote up a bunch of

392
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,720
guidelines

393
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,360
and published them through a standard

394
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,040
security awareness perspective

395
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,480
uh you know remind people that you know

396
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,079
you can't share waste management

397
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,680
confidential information with your

398
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,199
family members right you can't do those

399
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,399
kinds of things because now everybody's

400
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,399
packed into a small space

401
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,600
there was actually a moment where uh my

402
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,279
wife and i were living in a

403
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,639
two-bedroom our one-bedroom apartment a

404
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:42,000
two-room apartment

405
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,000
right we were swapping bedroom usage

406
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,040
just to make sure that we could uh keep

407
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,800
in contact with everybody

408
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,880
and lead through it in the identity

409
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,079
space as i noted before

410
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,920
we were able to push multi-factor

411
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:55,120
authentication uh

412
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:58,399
adaptive authentication all those things

413
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,839
very quickly and the adoption of single

414
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,560
sign-on went through the roof

415
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,760
on the operation side we did really

416
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,279
focus on

417
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,040
how are we getting visibility and these

418
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,600
endpoints are making sure everybody's

419
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,639
good

420
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,120
how are we ensuring that our data and

421
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,040
our assets are secure

422
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,320
yeah yeah i know you're raising some

423
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,480
great points and one thing i'd like to

424
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,959
go back to as you were talking about

425
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,639
having the right visibility uh and

426
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,199
understanding if anything unusual is

427
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,040
happening

428
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,719
and i i generally my general message is

429
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,480
that

430
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,240
at the core level you have to understand

431
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,279
what's happening both on the network and

432
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,079
on endpoints

433
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:38,720
and and really understand what

434
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:41,439
constitutes unusual behavior

435
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,279
and and once you see unusual behavior

436
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,120
then you have to have the right process

437
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,320
to escalate so

438
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,160
you know having the right incident

439
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,450
response plan in place

440
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,920
uh being able to say you know is this a

441
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:53,920
[Music]

442
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,639
large medium or small issue and if it's

443
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,479
large who do we engage when do we

444
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,560
engage the leadership team when do we

445
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,320
engage the ceo when do we engage the

446
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,279
board of directors

447
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,880
um and and i think that that's one you

448
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,199
know if there if there's a place that i

449
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,439
see where there's opportunities it's

450
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,839
that fundamental process

451
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,440
and general visibility into what's

452
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,880
happening and really understanding

453
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:21,120
what's unusual

454
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,680
um and and where identity comes into

455
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,639
play

456
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,000
is when you see something unusual you

457
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:30,320
should have a tight linkage

458
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,920
into um if if an event is severe enough

459
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:36,079
can i disable someone's id um

460
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,639
can i de-provision them you know

461
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:41,758
whatever that aspect happens to be right

462
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:44,720
uh or or if if i'm seeing someone

463
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,399
that's um that's accessing something

464
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,639
that they normally don't

465
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,759
um putting up some additional hurdles

466
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,120
right whether it's multi-factor

467
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,000
authentication

468
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,959
or or something otherwise or it could be

469
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,839
something like

470
00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:00,319
um sorry bob but you're not allowed to

471
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:03,199
access this supply chain system

472
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,680
um you know please please go and read up

473
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,519
on

474
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,120
on what you're supposed to be doing and

475
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:11,600
our policies

476
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:13,680
um i i think the other thing

477
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,120
i always go back to one of my early

478
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,800
experiences in

479
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,040
the corporate in my corporate cyber

480
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,160
security roles i sat down with

481
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:26,480
my cio at bank one back

482
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:28,639
in the uh paleozoic era in 97

483
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,240
and uh what one of the things i'll never

484
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,839
forget him saying

485
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,600
uh was if if there's anything that you

486
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,040
get right it's learn how to tell a good

487
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,639
story

488
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,399
right and and by that he was he was

489
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,920
referring to

490
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,759
you need to make sure that you can

491
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,719
communicate in

492
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,639
in clear business language why should i

493
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,279
make this investment

494
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,440
in protecting information whether it's

495
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,519
tools whether it's people

496
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,759
uh whether it's business process

497
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,480
optimization

498
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,000
and and i again i think there's a great

499
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,079
opportunity here when

500
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,240
you look at a lot of us look at

501
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:13,198
the investment and security from a

502
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:16,559
bottom line perspective

503
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:20,079
the conversation i find more interesting

504
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:22,079
is how how can the right investment in

505
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,799
in cyber security and particularly an

506
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:28,639
identity impact the top line

507
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:30,639
so so for example in in most companies

508
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,080
there's a lot of fragmentation in terms

509
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,440
of directories in terms

510
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:38,000
of um information stores for customers

511
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,760
etc and if you don't have

512
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,640
a good perspective of your overall

513
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,240
relationship with your customer

514
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,640
you know two things happen you don't

515
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,200
understand how to treat them

516
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,559
and and the other thing is if you have a

517
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,360
good idea of what products you're

518
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,559
selling to them

519
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,000
and what you're not then there's an

520
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,440
opportunity for cross-selling and

521
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,120
cross-marketing

522
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,840
so that's that's one of the business

523
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,918
contexts how does that play out

524
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,280
excuse me how does that play out uh at

525
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,679
waste management or

526
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,678
or other uh environments that you've

527
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:11,120
been in mike

528
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:13,679
um i i think we've seen identity and

529
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,399
parameters around identity itself

530
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,799
becoming

531
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,679
uh really the focus of our incident

532
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,960
response team our

533
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,240
security operations um you know you were

534
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,480
joking a minute ago about

535
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,720
paleolithic age and you know i've got

536
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:30,799
quite a bit of gray hair as well

537
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:34,080
i've been doing this a long time and uh

538
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:36,320
what we are seeing is the visibility

539
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,678
is moving from the network and from the

540
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,799
endpoint now we're

541
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,799
never going to push that all the way

542
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,840
away right but it's really you know

543
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,120
there's a marketing term out there i

544
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,840
don't even remember what

545
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,799
what a company uses it but identity is

546
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,360
the new perimeter

547
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,559
right so are you watching how the person

548
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,840
logs in where they log

549
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:56,720
in things like atypical logins

550
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,639
and impossible travel right we should

551
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,320
get our friends from a variety of

552
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,400
different countries you know because we

553
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,000
we work in uh several countries where

554
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,039
you see them log in in bangalore and

555
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,039
then you'll see them

556
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,720
log in in austin right which will

557
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,480
trigger us to go

558
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,240
investigate is this happening what

559
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,240
happened how did it happen

560
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,280
um yeah as those boundaries start to

561
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,880
disappear

562
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:22,000
um it is a imperative

563
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,080
to go figure out how am i going to

564
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,520
understand what's happening uh it's

565
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,720
further complicated

566
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,600
um a colleague of mine uh referred to a

567
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,120
while ago so

568
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,199
those wasn't doing this for a very very

569
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,678
long time remember you used to buy a zos

570
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,480
box

571
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,000
right and it came with everything you

572
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,320
needed to make it secure

573
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,520
right it had schedules and all these

574
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,080
things now as we entered the

575
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,440
era of open computing in the early 2000s

576
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,039
it suddenly became

577
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,400
things you would buy from a bmc or

578
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,440
computer associates and those kinds of

579
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,960
things

580
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,120
as we transitioned to the cloud

581
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,160
what you find is when you go do these

582
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,799
deals

583
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,200
it's now security is a feature that you

584
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,440
can

585
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,919
add to your subscription and so then it

586
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,280
becomes a very interesting conversation

587
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,039
where you have to go back and say right

588
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,440
it's no longer the security is a product

589
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,400
security is a feature of the product

590
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,919
that you have bought and how much of

591
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,760
those features that you need

592
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,280
and you know they're always you want

593
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,400
really really good security it's always

594
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,320
really really expensive and you find

595
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,640
yourself making those uh

596
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,720
decisions and it really has to go like

597
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,559
around hey we don't have visibility and

598
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,960
we have to get that visibility

599
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,039
in order for us to effectively protect

600
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,000
uh our assets and our people from these

601
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,520
kinds of scams

602
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,440
right yeah you know i think i think

603
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,520
there's some really good analogs that

604
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,440
can be used in terms of

605
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,000
uh the benefits of the right investment

606
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,320
so i i use quality as an analog

607
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,600
quite a bit right if you think of in the

608
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,000
automotive industry

609
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,559
honda has a reputation for building high

610
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,320
quality fuel-efficient cars

611
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,918
and and that's their competitive

612
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,039
differentiation

613
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,960
uh in a similar context making the right

614
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,240
investment and protecting information is

615
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,200
something that

616
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,240
um that can help give you competitive

617
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,799
advantage

618
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,440
um you know if you have good confidence

619
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,760
that

620
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,200
uh i'm considering doing business with

621
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,240
you as a business

622
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,799
or as as an individual if i know that

623
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,200
you're

624
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:20,320
doing the right things to protect my

625
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,080
information or my company's information

626
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,158
then then i'm going to have the comfort

627
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,559
that um

628
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,200
that my my information will more than

629
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,080
likely

630
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,280
be protected and you know breaches

631
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,360
always happen right

632
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,280
you know it's just part of business so

633
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,199
then the question becomes

634
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,760
are are you doing what's commercially

635
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:45,280
reasonable to minimize the damage when

636
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:48,158
when breaches happen uh it's like um

637
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,600
bank branches get robbed regularly but

638
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,440
the fact that they get robbed doesn't

639
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,840
mean the banks shut down right they put

640
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,600
in the right controls so they'll put in

641
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,000
video cameras they'll put in packs of

642
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,639
dying stacks of money so when

643
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,200
uh their their branches are robbed you

644
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,840
have a reasonable idea of who did it

645
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,679
and and then likewise you have the

646
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,000
ability to minimize

647
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,080
um the damage when it happens and not

648
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,919
lose as much money

649
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,080
um and i think there's a really strong

650
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,400
analog in terms of the

651
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,360
the the investment and and cyber

652
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,520
security and

653
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,280
and investing at a commercially

654
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,600
reasonable level

655
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,200
um one of the conversations we were

656
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,020
having earlier mike was

657
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,360
um well i identity is one

658
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,760
[Music]

659
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,399
core component of protecting information

660
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,360
it's one

661
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,559
tool in the toolbox right and and you

662
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,879
have to understand

663
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,639
where where the right fit is how how

664
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,919
have you approached

665
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,559
um identity and

666
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:52,320
and and it fitting into a broader

667
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,320
security solution center security

668
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:58,399
architecture

669
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:01,679
so identity is is fundamental

670
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,200
um most folks hate uh the provision

671
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,039
process right because you have to get

672
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,840
all the things right if you don't get it

673
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:10,879
right then things don't work

674
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,678
um moving towards digital identities has

675
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,039
been a

676
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,960
key component of what we've done this

677
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,919
year actually so if you think of our

678
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,039
population

679
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:21,039
of uh people who use technology

680
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,240
we have a lot of office workers do tens

681
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,679
of thousands of office workers people

682
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,960
take calls people who sit in offices

683
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,320
like this and

684
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,480
chat on the phone and go to meetings all

685
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:32,559
day long

686
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:34,960
and we also have drivers and people who

687
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,678
load trash and sort recyclables and

688
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,520
those kind of things

689
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,039
and traditionally we haven't digitally

690
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,279
engaged those people

691
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,240
so we are actually in the process of

692
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,960
digitally engaging

693
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,640
all of those people and functionally

694
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,159
doubling the size of people who engage

695
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,919
with us on a true digital level

696
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,919
this company is going through a digital

697
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,240
transformation um all those things you

698
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,240
said

699
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,919
before how do we know our customer how

700
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,919
do we ensure that we're not manually

701
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,679
keying from one system to another system

702
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,679
right how do we make our customer

703
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,640
service representatives incredibly

704
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,080
effective at

705
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,919
having the data needed to solve the

706
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,360
customer's problem at their at their

707
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,039
fingertips and that's

708
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,719
connecting all of these systems and

709
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,200
making sure all those systems that you

710
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,720
can

711
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,480
move seamlessly between them which is

712
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,360
fundamentally a single sign-on kind of

713
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,279
problem

714
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,719
uh and ensuring that the processes that

715
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,240
are moving data from one system to

716
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,400
another as we rebuild them and we

717
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,000
rebrand them

718
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,520
is also an identity problem how do you

719
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,960
make sure that the service accounts are

720
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,360
secure the privileged accounts are

721
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,240
secured and we're not losing things in

722
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:35,279
in translation um

723
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:38,640
it really does enable everything else

724
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,600
our chief digital officer uh as we got

725
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,559
through this i had i

726
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,120
used i had a one-on-one with him and uh

727
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,360
he says

728
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,719
mike you know and i was being you know

729
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,639
somewhat bashful

730
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,000
and you know self-deprecating he was

731
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,279
like mike every time i turned around

732
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,480
somebody said hey when's my cougar need

733
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,480
to solve this problem right

734
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,840
because at the end of the day it was how

735
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,200
fast can we onboard all these people

736
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,720
into the system and i'm going

737
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,559
well we have i got a great team right

738
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,400
he's like mike take the councilman

739
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,080
you know if we had to go configure cloud

740
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,679
right because all of cloud

741
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,520
is fundamentally about uh identity

742
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,120
right it's how do you configure those

743
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,320
security groups what is in those

744
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,439
security groups what are the permissions

745
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,678
of security groups have

746
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,720
and that's done by my team you know it's

747
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,159
not a

748
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,600
bob west id but it is nid and

749
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,120
you know making sure that all those

750
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,799
processes work and they work flawlessly

751
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,399
is perfect

752
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,000
yeah you know i wanna i wanna build on

753
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,200
one thing that you were saying that you

754
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,320
know

755
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,960
identity is is the perimeter

756
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,480
i think if there's two things that you

757
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,679
really need to get right

758
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,840
is is managing identity and

759
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,720
and then as rich was saying you know

760
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,840
encryption

761
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,880
uh plays a pivotal role in protecting

762
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,559
information

763
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,799
and i think there there's still a lot of

764
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:53,440
enterprises that think that

765
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,559
you know an inside is safe and outside

766
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,919
isn't

767
00:25:54,559 --> 00:26:01,200
right and and the reality is

768
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:03,679
that uh there are about 3 000

769
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,559
companies that are informed by the fbi

770
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,559
every year that they've been

771
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:09,840
compromising that's the first time

772
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:12,080
that they hear about it so so if your

773
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,520
mindset is the inside is safe and that's

774
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,840
the reality

775
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,918
um then then there's a bit of a a

776
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,039
mindset adjustment that needs to take

777
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,840
place

778
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:23,360
and and and as a consequence because

779
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,879
people historically have thought that

780
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,320
inside is safe

781
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,919
encryption has been something that

782
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:32,000
becomes optional

783
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,000
where where the mindset should be

784
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,000
understand what your crown jewels are

785
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,600
and and it doesn't

786
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,440
it doesn't matter where they sit whether

787
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,840
it's inside whether it's in the cloud

788
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,520
protect them properly encrypt the snot

789
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,520
out of them make sure you have a good

790
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,559
key management process you know make

791
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,760
sure that you're separating the

792
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,080
encryption keys

793
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,200
from what you're encrypting and then and

794
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,559
then the second thing

795
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,720
is making sure that there's good

796
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:57,039
identity process around everything

797
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,039
and and that you have a holistic way of

798
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,158
managing identities so as you provision

799
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,480
or deep provision

800
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,159
having the same process for the systems

801
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,520
that you manage as well as the systems

802
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,880
that are in the cloud

803
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,679
that is uh identity nirvana um

804
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,360
i know we're getting close to the end of

805
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,919
our presentation

806
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,639
um and i want to ask you one last

807
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,799
question

808
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:24,000
what what do you think the

809
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:26,000
the prevailing issues are that cyber

810
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,520
security organizations have in large

811
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,080
enterprises

812
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:35,360
that can be improved on

813
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,879
i think you hit on it earlier um i

814
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,199
personally spent an enormous amount of

815
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,080
time uh this year working through what

816
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,520
are the business

817
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,360
impacts of cyber security right

818
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,200
and that was that was a communication

819
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,879
conversation more than anything else

820
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,080
because uh one thing that i've learned

821
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,360
as we move from a traditional i.t

822
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,639
department to what was now

823
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,600
rebranded as digital is that customer

824
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,840
conversations

825
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,279
internal customer conversations internal

826
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,720
user conversations are critical how do

827
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,679
you do the storyboards how do you do all

828
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,919
those things

829
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,880
so you understand how people view life

830
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,480
rather than

831
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,919
uh building out systems kind of

832
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,520
deploying them to people you know

833
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,960
i've said in the past engineers are the

834
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,520
worst ui people because

835
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,320
we will tolerate a number of like weird

836
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,279
things

837
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,080
and when you sit down in front of

838
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,679
somebody who doesn't understand

839
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,639
technology that's just weird why would i

840
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,480
do that

841
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,720
um so we spent a lot of time this year

842
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,960
talking about what does it look like if

843
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,039
collection operations you know moving

844
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,000
trucks in and out of a yard to various

845
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,000
places

846
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,760
what does that look like if you can't

847
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,360
rely upon the data do i know where the

848
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,919
truck is do i know how

849
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,360
how soon the trick needs to be rerouted

850
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,279
all those pieces

851
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,439
and actually putting real financial

852
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:43,279
value in working through some of the

853
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,120
likelihood you know old school

854
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,000
annualized lost expectation behind the

855
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,840
calculation

856
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
and we've done that you know dozens and

857
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,240
dozens of times across our entire

858
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,360
our entire business so how do you get

859
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,520
past the

860
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,799
i'm a guy in a small shop that's

861
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,320
deploying capabilities that everybody

862
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,840
kind of thinks is important but not sure

863
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,158
why they think it's important

864
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,199
to a i can talk to you in terms that you

865
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,480
understand and we can have a

866
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,320
conversation about

867
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,440
oh you use this application to go close

868
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,960
the books well what happens if that

869
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,480
application isn't there

870
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,159
that application moves to the cloud

871
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,520
where it's got more exposure now how do

872
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,919
we make sure that we

873
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,918
maintain the integrity of that process

874
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:21,360
yeah and everything from

875
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:24,480
landfills to uh

876
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:27,120
to you know old school hr right

877
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,000
yeah yeah absolutely and you know i

878
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,600
think what one

879
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,440
there's a number of lenses that you you

880
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,719
can look at in terms of

881
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,720
how do you prioritize protecting systems

882
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,159
uh i i would expect that waste

883
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,440
management

884
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,240
some things that are on the short list

885
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:46,000
would be uh billing systems

886
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,760
uh fleet management um all those general

887
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,320
types of systems because

888
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,840
i i would want to understand what what

889
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,960
are the systems that i rely on to

890
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,399
generate revenue

891
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,399
right you know what's the short list and

892
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:00,080
and then there's other other lenses you

893
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,279
can look at right in terms of regulatory

894
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,960
compliance

895
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:06,799
uh et cetera et cetera et cetera but

896
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,120
but the revenue is something that anyone

897
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,799
in leadership will understand

898
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,120
right you know if if we don't protect

899
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,480
these systems properly

900
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,239
it means that we're not going to make

901
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,399
the amount of money that that we should

902
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,279
or we may lose money

903
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,080
on them hey john i know that we're

904
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,520
getting close

905
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:28,240
to our time allocations so

906
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,000
um perhaps this might be a good time to

907
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,559
field some questions

908
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,279
yeah i don't see anything in the q a uh

909
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,799
window

910
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,840
so folks if you have some questions

911
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,840
about identity

912
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,320
in any context identity is the new

913
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,879
perimeter

914
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:47,279
so uh please type your questions into

915
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,600
the chat or q a window and we'll

916
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,279
try to answer those you know if there

917
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:55,039
aren't any questions right now mike

918
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:57,600
um um would love to

919
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:59,679
understand your general guidance for the

920
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:04,080
others that are that are listening

921
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:04,480
um if you're starting from square one or

922
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,720
you're

923
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,039
you're transitioning from one gen of

924
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,840
identity solutions to another

925
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:13,279
um what what's the best way to do who do

926
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,639
you get involved

927
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:17,679
in in a large enterprise we've had some

928
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,519
success with

929
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,720
our internal controls people our

930
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,080
internal audit people

931
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,559
because they think about things in a

932
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,519
different way but broad engagement

933
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,559
uh and really trying to build the system

934
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,000
from scratch

935
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:33,600
is is important right the other general

936
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,279
advice i generally give people when i

937
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,199
talk about um

938
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,720
identity is it's important to move

939
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,519
forward right

940
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,799
identity has some really really really

941
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,039
hard

942
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:46,000
problems that have to be solved right

943
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,760
you think about name

944
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,279
changes when someone changes their name

945
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,559
and their id changes and how do we

946
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,399
change that back and updated all the

947
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:56,080
systems that you know so

948
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:57,039
focus on 80 not the 20 that is really

949
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,360
really hard and start

950
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,879
moving that way you know you can always

951
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,479
have a manual process for something that

952
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,080
happens very rarely but you've got to

953
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,799
get it right for the vast majority of

954
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,600
things

955
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:09,200
um making sure roles have owners that

956
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,199
there is a person that cares

957
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,960
right because at the end of the day i

958
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,519
tell my auditors and they get angry with

959
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,320
me

960
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,440
is i don't know what the business is you

961
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,639
know i don't know whether

962
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,320
bob west should have that uh entitlement

963
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,480
or not i simply don't know

964
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,158
right so if someone keys it into the

965
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,039
system and it gets approved i'm gonna go

966
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,120
provision it

967
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,960
so how do i work with the people who

968
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,279
care about these things

969
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,640
to ensure that we've got the right folks

970
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,919
making the right decisions as you go

971
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,880
through this provisioning and approval

972
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,480
process

973
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,640
yeah no entitlement management is

974
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,480
definitely something and to your point

975
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,720
um it's the business that really

976
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,360
understands what their employees need

977
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,320
access to

978
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,799
and you can you can take a guess uh in

979
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,720
in

980
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,399
the security organization but but it's a

981
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,519
guess right

982
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:57,678
and um one of the things i like that i

983
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,399
heard you say was you know get get 80

984
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,120
of the way there and prove the value one

985
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,719
of the things

986
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,239
that that we did um

987
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,480
in one of the large enterprise identity

988
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,600
implementations is we did an analysis in

989
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,679
terms of

990
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,080
what are the most common applications

991
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:19,039
that the average employee uses

992
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:22,080
and it ended up being less than 10.

993
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:24,399
and we focused on making sure that those

994
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,199
applications were really solid in terms

995
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:28,639
of

996
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:32,799
provisioning in terms of authentication

997
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:35,840
uh in terms of uh entitlement management

998
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:38,000
and and then we moved out a lot of it is

999
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,879
setting expectations uh

1000
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,919
on the business side um and and when

1001
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,399
employees or business partners can see

1002
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,399
uh a fundamental difference in terms of

1003
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:51,360
their experience

1004
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:53,199
then then it's much easier to say you

1005
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,399
know here here's the value that we got

1006
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,399
out of this investment right

1007
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,399
yeah absolutely um yeah because

1008
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,480
otherwise it's just the black hole

1009
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,399
right i tell my boss every year i tell

1010
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,640
them you know look

1011
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:08,399
i could spend a billion dollars a year

1012
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,240
on security right and we'd get about

1013
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,918
15 billion dollars in revenue i could

1014
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,040
buy every point product right i had this

1015
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,359
conversation with

1016
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,040
others inside and outside auditors like

1017
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,918
the trick is not pointing out things we

1018
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,279
could do

1019
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,239
right there's an infinite amount of

1020
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,919
things you can do that will

1021
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:24,959
incrementally make you better

1022
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:26,638
at defending but what is important is

1023
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,399
making the choices making strategic

1024
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,919
choices that you can explain to people i

1025
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,520
mean i think you said it very very well

1026
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:33,118
right that it's really about how does

1027
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,639
this benefit the business

1028
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,560
right because people don't care about

1029
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,159
technology that's for me to worry about

1030
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,239
and they trust me to worry about it and

1031
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,119
make good choices yeah but

1032
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:44,959
but moving forward on the you know how

1033
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,399
do we allocate a fixed pool of dollars

1034
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,480
and arguing for more or

1035
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,319
recognizing that i have to go down a

1036
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,560
little bit is really the art

1037
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,560
to sitting in a chair like this right

1038
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,639
that's the hard part

1039
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,320
yeah absolutely hey john i know we're at

1040

1042
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,359

1053
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,279
that you're right identity is the new

1054
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,400
perimeter

1055
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:31,040
and uh and that perimeter is changing

1056
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,680
as we change the way that we work to be

1057
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,279
