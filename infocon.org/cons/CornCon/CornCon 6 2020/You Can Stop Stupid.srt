12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,920
half

13
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:54,078
hour or give or take so i have to be

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,879
somewhat efficient with my time

15
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,320
so anyway uh oh go ahead and minutes up

16
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,440

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,399
okay uh well hopefully life will be

18
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,878
grand then

19
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,880
um so anyway let's do this i think i've

20
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,320
told this story before to the

21
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,080
corn con crowd but it's so iconic i'm

22
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,839
gonna tell it again and let's assume

23
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,158
people haven't heard it before

24
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,479
but one time i was doing a security

25
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,600
assessment espionage simulation

26
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:25,280
where i had to essentially go ahead and

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,439
we were infiltrating a company and i had

28
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,600
you know a tech guy with me hackerish

29
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,559
tight and i told him here's the deal

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,559
we're going to walk into the facility

31
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,400
during the morning rush hour we're going

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,439
to kind of follow people in and

33
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,840
everybody's going to be

34
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,199
essentially angling to the left we're

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,119
gonna go with them

36
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,040
there is a receptionist in the middle of

37
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,600
this large lobby

38
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,560
and we're just gonna try to ignore her

39
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,119
as best we can so anyway starts out we

40
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,360
go in and we have to like get up in an

41
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,200
elevator the elevator has card swipes

42
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,320
but of course everybody at that time is

43
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,960
swiping

44
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,279
pretty much of every floor so we just

45
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,119
decide to get out on the third floor

46
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,479
find an empty conference room i pick up

47
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,959
the phone i call people up and say hi um

48
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,879
i'm the cio i need contractors to get

49
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,280
badges where do i send them

50
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,200
and anyway after being transferred

51
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,440
around a couple times a woman says send

52
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,519
them down to the front lobby desk

53
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,440
so me and my accomplice go down there

54
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,840
and then the receptionist is like i

55
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,560
tried to stop you too you two went by

56
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,480
i'm like oh we were just talking um i

57
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,800
i'm sorry i didn't know we had to check

58
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,959
in

59
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,640
she's like oh don't worry you look busy

60
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,000
and she's like you're here now anyway i

61
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,000
go yes we are

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,680
and so i go well we need badges and we

63
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,519
were told to come see you and she's like

64
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,319
yeah hold on a second and she calls a

65
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,720
guard

66
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,720
the guard comes over and she tells the

67
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,080
guard these gentlemen need badges can

68
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,920
you please give it to them

69
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,840
so the guard takes us to the guard room

70
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,359
kind of off the lobby

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,360
and we walk in there and we get our

72
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,800
pictures taken and the guard goes so

73
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,599
what do you two guys do i go

74
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,599
um the computer stuff guard then goes oh

75
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,959
do you need server room access i go as a

76
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,518
matter of fact we sure

77
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,680
do and the guard tells us well here's

78
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,239
the badges the server room access you

79
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,159
know

80
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,680
not sure when it's going to be when the

81
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,599
computer is going to refresh

82
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,440
but probably within a couple hours

83
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,599
you'll have access so anyway

84
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,280
around lunch time because you know give

85
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,640
or take this was about still nine

86
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,959
o'clock in the morning

87
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,159
around lunchtime specifically because we

88
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,040
knew nobody would

89
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,519
as few people as likely would be there

90
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,159
we

91
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,239
went around the basement and just tried

92
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,720
swiping the card until we finally found

93
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,799
an

94
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,239
until it finally unlocked because we

95
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,200
assumed the server room was in the

96
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,080
basement

97
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,879
we walked in and we found all these

98
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,120
admin

99
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,040
systems like for example the windows

100
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,720
primary domain controller

101
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,440
logged on no screen savers logged on as

102
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,680
admin

103
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,480
we just went ahead added a new admin

104
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,200
user

105
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,879
and then left and we basically then had

106
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,480
full control of their network for all

107
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,679
practical purposes

108
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,238
so um we did other stuff but in a

109
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,280
little while later i wrote up my report

110
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,159
and along that

111
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,959
along that report essentially i

112
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,280
described the situation at a high level

113
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,040
and then what happened was a three weeks

114
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,680
later i got a call from some guy who

115
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,759
says

116
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,040
um i'm the facility manager i need to

117
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,160
know the name of the guard who gave you

118
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,720
the badge i'm like

119
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,639
what he's like i need to know the name

120
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,600
of the guard you gave you a badge i go

121
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,880
i'm not telling you

122
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,800
he's like what do you mean you're not

123
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,520
telling me i'm in charge of this bill

124
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,000
i go honestly i have no idea who the

125
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,280
hell you

126
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,960
are but fundamentally even if you are

127
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,960
who you say you are the only person i

128
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,960
report to is the cio

129
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,560
and if the cio asked me for the name of

130
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,359
the guard who gave me the badge

131
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,120
i'll give it to him but at the same time

132
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,800
you should know that if he does ask me

133
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,800
that when i give him the name i'll say

134
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,280
the fact this person gave me the badge

135
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,919
was

136
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,320
not good the fact you have no idea who

137
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,320
it is is infinitely worse

138
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,000
so of course you can imagine i never

139
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,880
heard from the cio

140
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,759
now what everybody thinks is the moral

141
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,919
was well

142
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,880
everybody laughs at the guard for you

143
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,599
know offering us server room access

144
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,360
but really was the guard really that

145
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,199
stupid i mean that's why it's funny

146
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,120
because you think the guard's stupid

147
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,320
but the reality is is like what did the

148
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,280
guard do the guard

149
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,159
did exactly what you would expect the

150
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,280
guard to do

151
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,720
in this environment which was listen to

152
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,280
the nice woman

153
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,479
who told everybody who who gets badges

154
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,638
and who doesn't

155
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,560
and then the server room access whose

156
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,840
fault is it that there was no

157
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,960
for example authorization string to go

158
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,039
ahead and provide

159
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,400
access to sensitive areas within the

160
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,320
organization

161
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,000
this is how it was just done and the

162
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,639
guard did nothing

163
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,600
that any other guard probably wouldn't

164
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,600
have done

165
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,199
not because the guards were stupid but

166
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,639
that's just because the whole

167
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,800
environment

168
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,319
so in this case yet no i'm not saying

169
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,600
about a stupid user

170
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,600
you know everybody thinks stupid

171
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,000
security guard again it's not the

172
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,960
people the end people like the guard or

173
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,520
the user

174
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,960
it's the systems in place that are the

175
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,560
stupid things and this is

176
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,239
really what the presentation is going to

177
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,560
focus on so

178
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,440
anyway let's hope i can do this without

179
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,919
um

180
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,840
screwing things up okay there we go so

181
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,240
anyway what is stupid you know looking

182
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,560
at the dictionary definition there is a

183
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,479
dictionary definition which is having or

184
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,000
showing a great lack of intelligence or

185
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,719
common sense

186
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,280
now stop to think about it and you know

187
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,840
this is

188
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,919
logical but do you hire people with a

189
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,039
great lack of intelligence again

190
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:41,680
do you go out and assume that

191
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,440
i'm gonna hire somebody who's stupid for

192
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,039
lack of a better term do they have a

193
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,240
great lack of intelligence

194
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,318
and if you do and you put these people

195
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,720
in a position of responsibility that

196
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,800
could cause significant damage again

197
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,440
whose fault is that and who's really

198
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,080
stupid likewise for common sense

199
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,960
you know if you if you see me before you

200
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,680
know i

201
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,239
live by the motto there is no common

202
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,199
sense without common knowledge

203
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,199
and if you're not giving people common

204
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,880
knowledge that's your fault if you do

205
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,360
that's one thing

206
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,880
but the reality is most people don't

207
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,120
have the common knowledge

208
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,880
that a cyber security professional would

209
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,199
and i'll be up front with you

210
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,280
i've dealt with cyber security people

211
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,520
who don't have as much common knowledge

212
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,758
as you would like to assume as well

213
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,120
but either way you know if somebody is

214
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,520
acting stupid

215
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,639
you know did you give them the training

216
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,719
do you expect

217
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,039
these people the failing because here's

218
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,880
the reality it is common

219
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,560
knowledge people will fail it is

220
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,520
therefore common sense

221
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,400
that at any given time with phishing for

222
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,039
example

223
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,318
four percent of the users will click on

224
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,960
a phishing message

225
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,960
it doesn't matter you know this whole

226
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,318
concept of the human firewall is

227
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,638
laughable because

228
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,080
four percent of the time according to

229
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,120
the verizon dbir

230
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,960
it's gonna fail now again

231
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,120
if you know it's common knowledge that

232
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,638
people are gonna exercise a lack of

233
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,520
common sense

234
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,080
again whose fault is it even assuming

235
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,240
you gave

236
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,599
them common knowledge you have to assume

237
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,599
they will fail

238
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,199
and the reality is and i don't think i

239
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,560
talk about this but people are going to

240
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,039
fail for a variety

241
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,919
of different reasons and lack of

242
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,199
awareness

243
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:30,159
lack of common sense is not always

244
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,080
the primary reason so anyway who's the

245
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,279
stupid one when it comes down to it the

246
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,039
users or the

247
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,679
i'm not going to say you because you all

248
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,640
are just truly paragons of security

249
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,880
virtue

250
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,598
but the reality is is that your

251
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:47,040
organizations are probably the people

252
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,880
making people stupid now here's the

253
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,800
thing it's not about you if you're a

254
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,200
cyber security professional you

255
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,240
listen and you read stuff and all this

256
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,040
you know you've been fed

257
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,760
a whole bunch of ignorant crap you know

258
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,160
every

259
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,680
awareness company out there give or take

260
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,760
even the good ones

261
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,079
tends to have you know they advertise

262
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,200
creating the human firewall

263
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,040
you know you know when you hear things

264
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,800
like this what are you going to assume

265
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,880
you hear companies and you hear all

266
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,120
these people in the awareness industry

267
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,800
you know pontificating how you your

268
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,720
users should be your last line of

269
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,439
defense or they should be the first line

270
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,680
of defense

271
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,720
or they should be the first and last

272
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,279
line of defense

273
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,800
at the same time you know i call this

274
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,120
bro science if you work

275
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,839
out you know in it like you know there's

276
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,880
a whole

277
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,320
terminology regarding going to a gym and

278
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,560
it's like you have the bros

279
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,959
in the gym it's like more protein bro

280
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,000
you know lift heavy bro you know

281
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:47,599
few reps lift heavy type of stuff

282
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,680
that's bro science you know not that and

283
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,160
if this is really right it's just passed

284
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,079
on from one of the bros to the other

285
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,600
this is how the awareness industry

286
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,760
pretty much is again

287
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,080
you hear these platitudes about the

288
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,120
users and what you should be doing

289
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,160
and you're basically hearing bro science

290
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,880
from people about

291
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,880
psychology and all this and those aren't

292
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,720
really great sciences to look at and

293
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,640
i'll cover why in a bit

294
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,480
but anyway here's the reality of the

295
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,720
situation and here's why

296
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,640
all of this is bad when you hear the

297
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,160
human firewalls your last line of

298
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,560
defense and everything

299
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,360
people are focusing on the proximity of

300
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,518
the error

301
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,600
in other words they are saying that

302
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,720
because a user makes a mistake

303
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,200
the solution is in the user and frankly

304
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,440
let's

305
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,920
be real the user might not be making a

306
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,920
mistake the user can be malicious

307
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,519
the user might know that they're doing

308
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,599
something wrong but they don't have the

309
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,519
time to do it right for example locking

310
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,440
up the desk at the end of the day

311
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,279
maybe they have to run to the daycare to

312
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,360
pick them up so they won't be fine

313
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,279
ten dollars a minute which is what

314
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,519
happens around me apparently

315
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,399
but when you focus on the proximity of

316
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,360
the error

317
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,040
you have issues because rarely is the

318
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,240
proximity of the era

319
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,680
the solution nor the cause of the actual

320
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,760
error itself so

321
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,199
let's talk about that because you know

322
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,240
it's kind of like saying i've showed

323
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,480
this before

324
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,399
but it's like saying if a canary dies in

325
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,600
a coal mine the solution is healthier

326
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,399
canaries

327
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,360
the reality is it's a canary's job to

328
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,120
die before

329
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,120
everything oh i shouldn't say a job but

330
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,040
let's just say it's a canary's fate

331
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,040
that they are the first thing to die in

332
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,560
a coal mine should there be poisonous

333
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,519
gas

334
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,920
and it's not the canary's fault it's the

335
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,680
fault of the entire environment likewise

336
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,519
it's not the user's fault

337
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,359
it's the fault of the environment that

338
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,800
they're forced to work within

339
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,399
in an organization so now here's newman

340
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,640
a lot of people hopefully remember

341
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,279
newman from the tv show seinfeld

342
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,279
but and newman himself is actually

343
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,000
irrelevant to this but i wanted a cool

344
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,040
memorable

345
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,079
image for the field of accounting

346
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,639
and why is that stop and think how would

347
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,760
it be

348
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:02,880
if a and as cfo walks into

349
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,319
the boardroom and says okay we've had a

350
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,240
10 million dollar loss

351
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,560
because the user did something wrong and

352
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,560
you know you can't blame the user

353
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,160
you know you can't stop stupid and all

354
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,359
this stuff the cfo would be

355
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,319
fired in a heartbeat why what is the job

356
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,079
of a cfo

357
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,279
the job of cfo is to ensure financial

358
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,399
processes

359
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,560
are seamless and work well more

360
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,760
important when you implement financial

361
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,199
process

362
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,839
you're going ahead and you're

363
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,800
implementing a system in place

364
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,639
that basically categorizes all incoming

365
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,279
you know financial data

366
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,000
it goes ahead and let's face it you

367
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,880
assume

368
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,600
a user is involved in inputting or

369
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,720
somehow

370
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,200
using financial resources along the way

371
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,360
but that doesn't mean that the system is

372
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,120
reliant upon the user

373
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,240
being the pivotal point in the whole

374
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,600
process doing it correctly

375
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,360
simultaneously they also go ahead and

376
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,240
have audits they have forensic

377
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,240
accounting

378
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,240
they're looking to make sure everything

379
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,880
resolves appropriately

380
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,800
in the end they don't just go ahead and

381
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,560
randomly

382
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,160
do things like say a user is our paragon

383
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,760
of virtue and our whole accounting

384
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,680
system relies upon

385
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,160
the user being aware again a cfo would

386
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,959
be

387
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,199
fired in a heartbeat for having making

388
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,000
their users the first and last line of

389
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,200
defense

390
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,720
of good accounting practices you know

391
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,120
here's another thing a lot of people

392
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,279
don't

393
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,880
know and i i maybe some people do but

394
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,959
i'm a scuba instructor

395
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,000
a master scuba diver trainer it's

396
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,000
actually you know

397
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,399
an open water scuba instructor with some

398
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,639
more skills and specializations

399
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,399
and a base number of certifications that

400
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,880
i perform for people

401
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,040
and essentially what happens is when i

402
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,920
certify people and this is an example

403
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,319
of like a group of students potentially

404
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,360
being

405
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,720
you know taking their skills test and

406
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,800
the first time i ever heard the

407
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,480
expression you can't can't

408
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,959
can apostrophe t stop stupid

409
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,959
was when i was actually taking my open

410
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,239
water scoop instructor class and the

411
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,319
course director

412
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,839
who was teaching us he goes you know you

413
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,600
can't stop stupid

414
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,959
and i'm sitting there thinking you know

415
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,800
what this whole

416
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:22,560
course is us attempting to stop stupid

417
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,079
because when you think about scuba

418
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,599
instruction you know

419
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,839
the first thing we do is we have

420
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,279
students fill out a medical evaluation

421
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,399
to make sure they don't just have a

422
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,800
heart attack

423
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,560
we try to go ahead and we make sure that

424
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,079
they're comfortable in the water so we

425
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,760
put them in a pool and see if they could

426
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,560
float for a period of time

427
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,319
and can swim for at least 25 50 yards i

428
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,920
forgot the exact number

429
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,199
and so that way you know they're not

430
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,639
going to freak out in the water when

431
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,279
they have to do things

432
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,760
then after that we go ahead we give them

433
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,079
like

434
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,519
they have to take hours and hours of

435
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,680
online training

436
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,480
which is essentially safety procedures

437
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,880
and how not to get killed in theory

438
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,480
so then you go ahead and they have that

439
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,480
then you have to give them a test to

440
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,320
make sure they've absorbed enough

441
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,240
i mean frank there you get they're given

442
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,920
a test online but a good instructor also

443
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,279
gives them a test in person

444
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,079
to make sure somebody didn't take the

445
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,839
test for them then you bring them into

446
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,199
the water and you don't just throw them

447
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,600
in the middle of the ocean

448
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,800
you bring them into the water at the

449
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,199
five foot mark

450
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,040
inside a pool just enough where well

451
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,959
actually three feet usually

452
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,560
just enough so they can like kneel down

453
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,758
and get their heads underwater and see

454
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,680
who can freak out

455
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,920
likewise the equipment's been inspected

456
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,239
and so on then once you see everybody

457
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,360
looks comfortable you let them slowly go

458
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,920
down from the

459
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,440
shallow end they slowly go down to the

460
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,680
deep end

461
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,240
and you watch them again even in the

462
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,680
deep end usually the pool's 10 maybe 15

463
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,160
feet at the most

464
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,239
can't really do much harm then assuming

465
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,319
they take all their skills and you go

466
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,320
through their skills and everything then

467
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,240
finally you take them to be open water

468
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,480
certified and this is an example of

469
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,320
people being open water certified where

470
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,639
you bring them to a platform the

471
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,800
platforms usually give or take about 15

472
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,600
feet but never more than 30 feet

473
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,758
again almost impossible for somebody to

474
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,079
harm themselves in 30 feet of water

475
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,800
can be done but if you're being watched

476
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,599
and everything

477
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,079
usually they can't do too much harm and

478
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,519
then

479
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,120
you know everybody's there and then

480
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,360
you're going through one at a time

481
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,279
now also when i'm in the water one thing

482
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,399
that's not as obvious and it's hard to

483
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,480
see on the slide

484
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,240
but there's somebody watching and i

485
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,279
always make sure i bring in a system

486
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,240
instructor

487
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,839
or a s or a dive master just so that

488
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,199
they can watch everybody because one

489
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,440
time for example

490
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:42,000
you know i'm there in a position like

491
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,040
this where i'm the person

492
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,800
watching one student do a skill

493
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,560
and then i notice in the corner of my

494
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,560
eye another student decides i'm going to

495
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,359
look under the platform and see what's

496
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,359
there

497
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,279
and i start going over there but the

498
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,759
dive master has already caught them

499
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,000
because

500
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,000
why because somebody's going to do

501
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,079
something they're not supposed to

502
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,559
and then you know you think about it but

503
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,280
even after that so even underwater we're

504
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,839
working

505
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,639
watching people and so on but that's not

506
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,879
even it

507
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,559
we also have insurance we know where the

508
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,880
local hospitals are

509
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,399
the facility has insurance the school

510
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,799
has insurance the

511
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,240
instructor has insurance we even take

512
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,039
out insurance policies

513
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,039
on the students but just in case they

514
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,559
get injured that's standard practice in

515
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,039
the dive industry too

516
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,678
so the whole issue about scuba diving

517
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,080
there's

518
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,720
a gazillion ways you could probably get

519
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,120
hurt

520
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,400
the reality though is because of all the

521
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,080
processes in place

522
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,360
and expecting a user or diver to do

523
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,600
something stupid

524
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,719
diving is statistically safer than

525
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,520
bowling

526
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,919
that's actually a true story but anyway

527
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,600
so

528
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,000
then this brings up the whole related

529
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,399
issue of safety science there is a

530
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,240
science of safety science and

531
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,520
fundamentally they look at

532
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,320
why somebody gets injured and a user

533
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,960
is considered as much a part of the

534
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,120
system

535
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,559
as a computer when you apply that to

536
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,959
cyber security

537
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:11,760
the computer is the system the file

538
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:15,039
servers are the system the user is just

539
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,640
an entry point into the system

540
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,960
and when they look at things from a

541
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,559
safety science perspective they see the

542
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,120
results of failure

543
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,280
and they look at it comprehensively if a

544
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,120
user injures themselves in a

545
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,879
in a company in a manufacturing

546
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,959
environment they look at that as a

547
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,360
failure of the entire system

548
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,400
not of the user because the entire

549
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,639
system did not

550
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,600
frankly the entire system enabled them

551
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,919
to be injured

552
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,959
but then allowed the injury to actually

553
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,520
happen

554
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,520
so again they look at the humor is just

555
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,559
the proximity of the error

556
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:51,200
and the error itself is just a

557
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,200
symptom and that's a critical aspect

558
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,559
clearly when a user makes a mistake in

559
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,760
cyber security

560
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:59,840
it's a symptom of a failure of the whole

561
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,200
system and this something you really

562
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,840
really

563
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,120
got to get across but user error where

564
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,959
we go it's just a

565
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,039
symptom of what's wrong with the

566
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,400
computing systems that we are supposed

567
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,400
to support

568
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,840
now taking this to the extreme if you

569
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,320
look at it from a safety science

570
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:19,600
perspective these are 737 jets

571
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,720
and the 737 jets theoretically um

572
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,719
oh sorry specifically 737 max

573
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,840
jets you can tell by the shape of the

574
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,480
winglets

575
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,120
anyway obviously these are all parked

576
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,799
why

577
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:35,840
because 737 max jets had a tendency to

578
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:37,679
aim themselves into the ground now when

579
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,240
this first happened everybody has

580
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,960
it must be the pilots was this pilot era

581
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,559
cause

582
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,240
airplanes like a 737 they don't just aim

583
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,200
themselves into the ground

584
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,640
so clearly it must be the pilot right

585
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,559
and then you stop and think

586
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,679
well right now you should know the real

587
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,918
answer based on

588
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,679
what i'm saying but the reality is could

589
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,880
the pilots have saved the plane

590
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:04,320
the answer is yes but

591
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,960
the problem was initiated years before

592
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,720
this

593
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,480
when they started redesigning the

594
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,520
software on the 737

595
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:14,559
map for the 737 max jets

596
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:18,320
you know compared to the original 737

597
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:20,559
you know 200 800 900 series airplanes

598
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,918
and what happened was and the reason

599
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,678
these accidents occurred

600
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,559
was that these 737 jets have aoas angle

601
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,480
of attack

602
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,678
sensors on the side of planes i don't

603
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,039
know if mike doherty's

604
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,120
listening now but anyway he can verify

605
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,559
or he can criticize whichever is

606
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,439
applicable

607
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,320
but the reality of the situation is that

608
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,200
in the past

609
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,000
versions of the jets there were warnings

610
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,919
if the

611
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,720
angle of attacks on each side of the

612
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,440
planes disagreed and

613
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,120
what happened was they assumed kind of

614
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,320
they gave out a warning

615
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,600
and they assumed pretty much not a bad

616
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,320
situation

617
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,799
but with the 737 max jets they

618
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,200
reprogrammed the system and first off

619
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,918
they took away the warning indicator by

620
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,120
default

621
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,720
that said the two aoas on bo on either

622
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,439
side of the plane were disagreeing with

623
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,679
each other

624
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,120
that was number one pilots weren't made

625
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,640
aware of that because they never

626
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,918
implemented the training

627
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,000
because training they said these are

628
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,600
737s they're similar enough

629
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,520
you could just read a document for the

630
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,158
differences and that

631
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,039
that if that was reflected in the

632
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:31,039
documents it was not reflected well

633
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,360
so that was another issue and then the

634
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,679
warning lights went out and pilots did

635
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,879
actually save these planes because the

636
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,400
autopilot

637
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,880
again saw these 730s the aoas disagree

638
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,280
they assumed the plane was going down

639
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,480
and if you're not familiar with the

640
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,080
applicable sciences when a plane starts

641
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,320
going down for whatever reason

642
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,760
the way to fix the situation is to make

643
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,399
the plane go faster

644
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,080
because faster planes generate more lift

645
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,799
and the way to do that quickly

646
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,639
is to angle the plane down and that

647
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,960
increases the speed which then can

648
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,919
in turn increase the lift and get the

649
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,120
planes heading back

650
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:11,360
up this however was the

651
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,280
autopilots were however saying okay

652
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,959
we're going to speed up the plane

653
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,960
and what happened was they aimed

654
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,640
themselves down pilots saw what was

655
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,679
going on they turned off the autopilot

656
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,280
took control

657
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,280
got everything handled then they turned

658
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,600
the autopilot back on and boom

659
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,320
planes headed back down again pilots

660
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,959
were left

661
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,200
really really confused is this what you

662
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,200
want in a situation for the pilots could

663
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,200
the pilots have saved it

664
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,960
theoretically if they anticipated every

665
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,440
problem possibly

666
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,080
was the pilot really the problem no the

667
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,960
pilots

668
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,760
the problems were systematic and the

669
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,280
pilots just

670
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,158
failed across the board as part of the

671
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,000
system

672
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,360
they did everything right that they were

673
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,200
trained to in general

674
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,600
but there were there were things they

675
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:59,360
were never informed of

676
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:02,080
um so where does blame usually fall

677
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,199
or where should it fall the usual fault

678
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,520
that everybody

679
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,840
assumes is like it's the user you know

680
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,639
user fault is but that's really only

681
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,520
ten percent of actual problem the

682
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,400
environment

683
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:17,039
is ninety percent of the problem even

684
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,400
looking at the 737 max jet issue for

685
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:21,360
example

686
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,360
it was the software that caused the

687
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,120
whole failure of the system

688
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,559
it wasn't just all of a sudden the plane

689
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,918
decided to head down

690
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,000
it was the software it was the

691
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,760
environment the plane was operating fine

692
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,480
it was the software environment

693
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,480
that took the system down but anyway you

694
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,559
know in cyber security you look at where

695
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,080
things happen you look in safety science

696
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,559
where things happen

697
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,760
so for example safety science you know

698
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,240
um

699
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,000
they look at the injuries that occur

700
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,000
they find that ninety percent of the

701
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,480
injuries occurred in for example

702
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,559
manufacturing environments because of

703
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,240
the systems in place because of the

704
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,520
design of the equipment

705
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,200
you know there is one case where i was

706
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,480
doing an awareness program for

707
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,559
manufacturing

708
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,480
actually so i can name them but you know

709
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,840
let's just say they were a manufacturing

710
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,559
organization

711
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,199
and they ended up you know having for

712
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,760
example

713
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,960
heavy wrenches fall on people they

714
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,840
solved the problem by

715
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,880
drawing the silhouette of where a wrench

716
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,760
is supposed to be

717
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,559
when not in use ironically not only did

718
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,279
they go ahead

719
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,960
and stop those errors from happening or

720
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,480
for the injuries from happening because

721
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,720
the things were put in place

722
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,760
it also stopped the theft of a lot of

723
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,840
hand tools

724
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,440
because now very quickly at the end of

725
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,360
the day you could see if the tool was

726
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,919
there or if the tool was not there

727
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,120
so that was a that was actually uh what

728
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,960
do you call it a

729
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,279
side effect a good side effect of

730
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,279
everything but then the user

731
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,760
for whatever reason is involved ten

732
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,760
percent of the time or usually at fault

733
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,799
at ten percent of the time what is that

734
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,480
ten percent

735
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,918
could be carelessness in other words

736
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,360
they know what to do

737
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,120
but they just don't do it it could be

738
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,399
blatant ignorance or the lack of

739
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,719
training same thing

740
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,799
more important it could be malice the

741
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,120
user could intend to do something wrong

742
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:08,320
and if you look at the dbir again

743
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:11,039
the dbir kind of finds that 28

744
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,918
of all incidents occur because of

745
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:16,879
malicious activity by an authorized user

746
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:19,760
so that's critical to understand

747
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,440
but the ten percent as a whole this is

748
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,679
where awareness and training

749
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,039
might fit in you know telling people

750
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,080
what they should be doing how they

751
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,120
should be doing it

752
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,879
maybe providing extra motivation on why

753
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,639
they should be doing it even if they

754
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,960
think they don't have the time to do it

755
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,840
but that's still only ten percent of the

756
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,000
problem

757
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,120
and here's uh you might have seen this

758
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,200
before but

759
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,360
awareness this is applied behavioral

760
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,760
science at the end of the day though and

761
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,399
this is a critical factor for those

762
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,440
trying to solve the user error or the

763
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,200
user

764
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,480
action problem and i'm going to call it

765
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,000
user action

766
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,320
for now and then we'll talk about

767
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,360
another phrase in another slide or two

768
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,000
but you know stopping user action the

769
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,678
way

770
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,200
this happens in applied behavioral

771
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,679
science when you consider it

772
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,440
you have an antecedent antecedent in our

773
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,200
world is awareness training

774
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,279
you know something that is supposed to

775
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,799
get the users to behave

776
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:17,120
in a given acceptable way and

777
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,639
then so you give them information for

778
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,199
example how to do things right

779
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,840
and then you tell the user please do

780
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,480
things right they're left to their own

781
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,879
devices and

782
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,120
when they behave in a given way they

783
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,840
then have a consequence of one form or

784
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,080
another

785
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,520
now the concept is the consequence could

786
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,439
be good bad or neutral

787
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,360
so one thing we tell users is not to

788
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,960
reuse their personal passwords with

789
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,678
their work pass or you know

790
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,000
as their business password and think

791
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,240
about this way we tell a user go ahead

792
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,600
you know don't reuse your password let's

793
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,799
face it they do

794
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:53,360
what is the consequence for reusing

795
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:55,158
a personal password as the business

796
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,918
password

797
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:59,200
99.9 percent of the time there is no

798
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,880
consequence

799
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,120
and that means it's a positive

800
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,559
consequence why because they have

801
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:08,320
one less password to remember and so

802
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,080
they're more likely when they have to

803
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,480
use passwords again to keep

804
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,480
using the same password the only time

805
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,559
there's a negative consequence

806
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,559
in order that will get them to change it

807
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:21,600
if for example their account

808
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,240
their pat user id and password ends up

809
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,439
on

810
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,360
you've been pawned and somebody

811
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,440
figures it out and starts doing this

812
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,199
this was the case for example i think it

813
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:35,039
was about a year ago or so

814
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,120
when the ring when hackers were breaking

815
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,360
into people's home networks

816
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,360
and talking to people's children if they

817
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,080
were using the ring system

818
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,959
where parents put ring cameras inside

819
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,678
their house

820
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,559
to watch their kids and what happened

821
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,679
was

822
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,000
they had they reused their passwords

823
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,799
from

824
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,720
other sites for their ring account in

825
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,158
other words they had their basic email

826
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,279
address that they use on all their

827
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,279
internet accounts

828
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,919
they then had a password that they kept

829
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:07,120
reusing on multiple accounts

830
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:09,120
and what happened was all of a sudden

831
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,000
they were reusing these passwords

832
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,039
somebody sees these hack passwords and

833
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,679
starts trying to

834
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,440
just guess it on the ring site and then

835
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,200
they got access to accounts and then

836
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,840
they could you know go ahead

837
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,279
and look at the um look at the cameras

838
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,439
inside the house

839
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,640
as well as interact with people so they

840
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,120
would see children

841
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,559
on these accounts or sorry children in

842
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,199
their bedroom and they would start

843
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,440
talking to the children in the bedroom

844
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,840
that's a negative consequence and

845
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,440
that was maybe getting people to change

846
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,240
their behavior hopefully

847
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,360
but really you gotta understand

848
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,880
awareness

849
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,559
20 of the potential problem 80

850
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,799
of changing people's behavior

851
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,240
influencing behavior not changing it but

852
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:55,120
influencing behavior

853
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,039
is based upon consequences it's not

854
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,239
based upon an awareness program so

855
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,120
remember that

856
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,440
now let's talk about the concept of boom

857
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,360
and

858
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,399
i mentioned this before but boom is

859
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,559
counter is a counter terrorism principle

860
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,439
basically you have left the boom boom

861
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,039
and write a boom

862
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,039
left the boom are those steps that

863
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:15,440
prepare that lead up to

864
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,200
a terrorism attack boom is essentially

865
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,480
the attack itself right of boom

866
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,480
is mitigating the damage or catching the

867
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,760
bad guys whatever the case is

868
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,000
from a terrorism attack so you look at

869
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,640
it

870
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,559
and what's there in counterterrorism

871
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,960
left the boom we're talking prevention

872
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,240
in other words what you're trying to do

873
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,600
in left to boom

874
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,000
is you're going ahead and figuring out

875
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:41,199
who are the potential bad guys

876
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,480
who might do us harm you you collect

877
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,080
intelligence on them

878
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,520
you figure out if you want to go arrest

879
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,199
them you want to blow them up you want

880
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,639
to do whatever you want to do

881
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,559
to stop these bad people from existing

882
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,880
or at least launching an attack against

883
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,080
you then simultaneously you figure out

884
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,000
wait a second

885
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,399
i'm not going to be able to stop

886
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,520
everyone but at least let me try to put

887
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:04,320
in protection for

888
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,600
likely targets and so i'm going to go

889
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,399
ahead and one for

890
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,158
one case for example in um that the

891
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,080
september 11th bombings

892
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,919
a lot of people well some people know

893
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:17,039
but for example in the september

894
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:19,600
11th bombing on the pentagon

895
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:21,600
the pentagon actually started preparing

896
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,000
itself not necessarily for an airplane

897
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,240
flying

898
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,360
into it but it prepared itself for a

899
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,919
potential bombing

900
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,840
inside and they reinforced the walls

901
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,240
they started hardening things put in

902
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,720
extra steel put an extra protection

903
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,080
throughout the building now when the

904
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,000
airplane came in

905
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,080
obviously they didn't plan for that but

906
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,919
they did go ahead and the protection

907
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,158
they did to stop a bomb

908
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,200
significantly decreased the amount of

909
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,760
death and

910
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,120
other issues and damage that they would

911
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,279
have incurred otherwise

912
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,719
then obviously boom point to boom you

913
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,720
can have different things like bomb

914
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,480
detectors you can for example harden

915
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,279
cockpit doors or whatever

916
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,799
and that's boom write a boom you have

917
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,840
the response you figure out you know

918
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,679
what

919
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,360
what happens if there's a secondary

920
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,720
explosion unfortunately like what

921
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,519
happened with the boston marathon

922
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,080
bombings

923
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,440
we can't just send responders in because

924
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,320
they want to help people

925
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,279
but how do we do that responsibly in

926
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,879
case

927
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,640
there's secondary explosion what if

928
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,679
there's poisonous gas what if there's

929
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,519
radiation

930
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,840
how do we do things how do we get things

931
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,039
up and running what about also making

932
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,519
sure we have enough

933
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:29,760
hospital beds for people and so on and

934
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,679
then also if there's bad people involved

935
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,679
how do we close the city down

936
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,440
how do we close an area down to try to

937
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,440
isolate the bad people and so on

938
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,039
it's a very complicated issue and

939
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,960
different professions

940
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,120
and different technologies are used

941
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,120
throughout the entire cycle

942
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,239
however in cyber security guess what

943
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,479
guys you probably

944
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,760
don't have that but in the real world

945
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,240
though they look at this as a

946
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:55,360
comprehensive thing in cyber security

947
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,919
we don't that's one of our failings

948
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,959
we look at user error as the human

949
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,679
firewall

950
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,120
we look at it as making our users the

951
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:07,120
last line of defense

952
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:09,360
just no anyway with ninety percent of

953
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,959
attacks involving user compromise

954
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:16,320
if you focus on boom as a user

955
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,919
action and again user action think about

956
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,039
the fact that you're gonna stop

957
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:23,840
ninety percent of most of the attacks

958
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,440
so again phrasing this whole thing boom

959
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,240
is the user action

960
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,559
that can initiate a loss and this is one

961
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,320
thing as opposed to user action

962
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:34,320
we call i start calling it user

963
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,360
initiated loss because the user

964
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,678
doesn't cause damage or loss the

965
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,719
system as a whole allows for it to

966
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,799
happen

967
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,320
it's not a user that deletes all the

968
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,799
files on a system

969
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,639
it's the system operating system that

970
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,679
delete the files that's a critical

971
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,480
distinction

972
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,399
they can type a command in it doesn't

973
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,360
mean the system should allow the command

974
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,080
to execute

975
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,678
as a critical example and too many

976
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,120
people in the cyber security world they

977
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,880
just throw their hands up and say you

978
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,239
can't stop stupid it's like no

979
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,799
yes you can stop stupid that is your job

980
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,679
to stop stupid and that's a critical

981
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:12,399
difference

982
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,799
than the way people currently act it's

983
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:15,518
your

984
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:18,080
job to sound stupid the user just

985
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:21,679
initiates a potential loss

986
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:24,158
you the system has to allow the loss

987
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,240
to be initiated the system has to

988
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,919
present the user with an opportunity

989
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,840
for example a phishing message that

990
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,760
contains ransomware

991
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,399
the system has to let the phishing

992
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:37,679
message all the way through to the user

993
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:39,360
it then has to allow the user to do and

994
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,840
initiate that by clicking on the

995
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,918
ransomware but then it has to allow the

996
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,678
user to install the ransomware

997
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,679
it has to allow the ransomware to

998
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,480
encrypt files all over the network and

999
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,519
stuff

1000
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,519
the user might initiate the

1001
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,159
execution of the ransomware but the

1002
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:59,440
ransomware should not be successful

1003
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,760
if your network is secure by design

1004
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,080
i guess zero trust is one aspect but you

1005
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,559
understand what we're talking about

1006
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,678
by the way you want to stop the loss

1007
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,839
potential

1008
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,440
but you also want to stop the loss from

1009
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:14,560
being realized

1010
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,720
so anyway really leave that here so now

1011
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,320
when we're talking about users in cyber

1012
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:20,560
security environments

1013
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,520
your goal is to prevent the user from

1014
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:26,078
being in a position to initiate the loss

1015
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:28,079
in the ideal world the user can click on

1016
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,919
a phishing message for example

1017
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,599
if you stop the phishing message from

1018
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,480
getting there for example you can use

1019
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:34,800
dmarc

1020
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,639
to make sure your domains aren't being

1021
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,839
spoofed as one example

1022
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,760
you then go ahead and you have

1023
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:42,000
anti-malware things that go ahead and

1024
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,040
delete messages before they get to the

1025
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,199
user

1026
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,440
then likewise you're creating a culture

1027
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:49,439
you know this is where like again

1028
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,839
user awareness i kind of say is that the

1029
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:56,560
point of boom but your awareness program

1030
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:59,599
also should create a culture as a whole

1031
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,119
that gets people to do the right things

1032
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,359
by default

1033
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,520
you know i keep using the example of

1034
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:07,759
when i worked at nsa and this is kind of

1035
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:11,040
a left to boom issue to a certain extent

1036
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,160
but when i worked at nsa i had a badge i

1037
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,960
had to wear

1038
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,520
and obviously and then one like to do my

1039
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,119
job for

1040
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,800
a point in time i had to take off my

1041
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,839
badge leave it on the desk while i use

1042
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,680
this plotter

1043
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,200
the plotter had a mechanical arm so you

1044
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,000
didn't want a dangling badge while you

1045
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,078
used it

1046
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,520
then i was like working shift work three

1047
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,720
o'clock in the morning i ran

1048
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,560
out to the go use the restroom when i

1049
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,319
was in the hallway all of a sudden

1050
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,920
guards stopped me because guards do

1051
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,000
round in nsa

1052
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,040
and the guard's like where's your badge

1053
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,200
i'm like oh

1054
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,720
and then i like oh must be by my desk

1055
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,160
he's like okay we're going to your

1056
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,919
office i'm like you're not allowed

1057
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,680
anywhere near my office

1058
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,119
he's like then i'll wait by the main

1059
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,078
entrance so

1060
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:53,760
guard followed me i opened up the door

1061
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:56,960
and he held it ajar

1062
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,440
i then went into my office within the

1063
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,880
office and i kept looking for my badge

1064
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,560
and my co-workers all this

1065
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,040
after a while goes are you looking for

1066
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,240
something ira and i'm like where's my

1067
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,599
effin badge

1068
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,118
he's like you mean the badge that should

1069
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,320
be around your neck i'm like give me my

1070
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,280
 badge

1071
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,880
and he's like and then we you know the

1072
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,599
guard's like is there a problem and then

1073
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,359
finally the

1074
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,200
guy gave me the badge i showed it to the

1075
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:21,119
guard but do you think i ever

1076
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,319
went ahead and left my bed somewhere

1077
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,760
else that was a

1078
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,640
culture that you know that was a painful

1079
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,480
lesson

1080
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,040
but that was a lesson because there was

1081
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,000
the culture of wearing badges

1082
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:36,320
so anyway likewise users can help you

1083
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,760
detect for example tailgaters and a

1084
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,160
whole bunch of other people

1085
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,760
stop people who aren't wearing badges as

1086
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,520
an example

1087
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,200
anyway then you have governance and this

1088
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,359
is probably the key factor

1089
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,040
all organization processes should be

1090
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,240
clearly defined we don't do that in

1091
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,279
cyber security

1092
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:55,839
we tell users okay well do this do that

1093
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,920
everybody should you know again every

1094
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,799
user should know how to do their job

1095
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,720
properly

1096
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,400
and this is a failing of awareness we're

1097
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,959
training people and you'll see another

1098
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,760
slide

1099
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,280
we're training people to be elmer fudds

1100
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,680
governance should say how

1101
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,480
a specific job is done from start to

1102
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,118
finish

1103
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,880
it should define security throughout the

1104
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,280
entire process

1105
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,079
before it gets to a user once it's at a

1106
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,640
user and then

1107
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,440
after the user has their impact on the

1108
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,118
process

1109
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,560
there should be governance regarding

1110
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,640
that but again

1111
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,400
the whole process should be planned out

1112
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,078
in advance and if you do governance

1113
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,640
right you might even be able to take

1114
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,880
users

1115
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,799
out of the process to begin with and if

1116
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,280
a user is not in the process

1117
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,280
they can't initiate a loss now we're at

1118
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,480
the point of boom the user is presented

1119
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,119
with the opportunity

1120
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,440
to initiate a loss now this goes to do

1121
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:47,599
we have a good user experience

1122
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,680
do we guide the users to do things

1123
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,599
properly are there warnings other

1124
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,078
indicators like this is an external

1125
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:56,320
email in the case of phishing messages

1126
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,119
as an example to get people to do things

1127
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,280
right

1128
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,800
but at this point you know hey this

1129
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,280
might be where awareness is

1130
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,000
do they do the action do they detect it

1131
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,119
do they prevent

1132
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,280
it do they let people know from you know

1133
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,000
there's an attack in process those are

1134
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,480
critical

1135
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,119
remember any of this can be accidental

1136
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,760
careless

1137
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:18,000
willful malicious or forced and what i

1138
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,599
mean by force is maybe a bad guy is

1139
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,920
forcing somebody to do something for

1140
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,040
whatever reason you don't know what's

1141
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,320
going on

1142
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:28,880
but you have to assume the action itself

1143
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:31,599
the initiation of the loss you can't

1144
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,599
attribute a reason to it at this time

1145
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,440
and frankly again the reason is

1146
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,760
irrelevant at this point

1147
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,119
and like i mentioned before with

1148
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,160
awareness programs

1149
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,680
a good awareness program is supposed to

1150
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,598
embody the process

1151
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,720
and tell people how to implement the

1152
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,800
process

1153
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,959
the reality though we're training people

1154
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,720
in awareness to be elmer fudds

1155
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,520
always be on the lookout for the westley

1156
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,839
wabbit always tell people you know

1157
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,800
here's the you know be on the lookout

1158
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,880
for the bad guy

1159
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,400
and the ba and your users are doing what

1160
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,680
you tell them they're like is this that

1161
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,720
hacker i was told about

1162
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,240
it's like no hackers do things this way

1163
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,240
and they're not telling me to do things

1164
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,799
this way this was completely a different

1165
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,680
way

1166
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,560
so clearly it's not the hacker again the

1167
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,799
concept is

1168
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,400
users should be doing things right they

1169
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,960
shouldn't be afraid about

1170
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,079
what's going to go wrong if you tell

1171
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,720
users how to

1172
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,160
implement governance properly how to do

1173
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,078
their job properly

1174
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,359
they're not sitting there because think

1175
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,040
about it this way

1176
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,640
the criminals you're facing if you're

1177
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,839
dealing with a phishing message you're

1178
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,839
dealing with whatever

1179
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:37,359
you're dealing with bad guys trying to

1180
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:39,359
steal information

1181
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:41,040
you're likely dealing with you know

1182
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:43,680
organized criminals

1183
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,800
sociopaths you know well-funded

1184
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,520
organizations

1185
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,680
you don't want a low-level employee

1186
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:52,560
being your front line of defense

1187
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,598
against an organized criminal and that's

1188
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,359
what happens

1189
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,640
you know whether or not this is like the

1190
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,400
russian mafia

1191
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,480
or it's just kind of like a low-level

1192
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,440
gang that's trying to get ransomware for

1193
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,280
the first time

1194
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,520
it doesn't matter but your users should

1195
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:08,480
be thinking what is the right way to do

1196
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,720
things not who should i be afraid of

1197
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,640
then we get to write a boom right a boom

1198
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,560
the loss has been initiated for whatever

1199
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,400
reason the user did something

1200
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,480
that if you don't stop it is going to

1201
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,079
set off a sequence of events

1202
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,440
you know and how do you do things like

1203
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,319
that you set up your environment

1204
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,319
properly

1205
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:26,160
you go ahead users don't have admin

1206
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:27,920
privileges as an example

1207
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,839
you put in data leak prevention you put

1208
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,640
in web content filtering

1209
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:35,279
you have limited accesses for users who

1210
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,640
don't need the accesses and so on

1211
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,960
you know are there additional

1212
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:41,118
protections are you using user and

1213
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,800
user entity and user and entity

1214
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:45,200
behavioral analytics

1215
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,000
are you looking for the initiation of

1216
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,160
damage

1217
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,079
are you looking for this and then are

1218
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,799
you proactively stopping it

1219
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,000
because a user you know i i get involved

1220
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,000
in these arguments about

1221
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,599
awareness being you know people claim

1222
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,720
awareness is a waste of money i still

1223
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:03,839
think it's one of the

1224
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:06,399
best uses and should have a legitimate

1225
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:07,759
budget and you have people who say users

1226
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,720
should click on everything and it should

1227
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,440
be irrelevant

1228
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,560
you know what to a large extent they're

1229
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,800
right

1230
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,839
but that should not be your entire

1231
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,760
program

1232
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:20,078
you know again one of the problems is

1233
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,400
you have people working in silos

1234
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,119
you have some people who focus on left

1235
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,119
the boom

1236
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,880
type of cyber activities you have the

1237
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,599
awareness people who focus on the point

1238
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,520
of boom

1239
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,520
then you have other people who focus on

1240
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,240
write a boom like your engineers your

1241
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:37,040
people doing daily prevention and so on

1242
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,959
all these people are focusing in silos

1243
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,920
but the problem is you should never rely

1244
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,640
upon

1245
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,079
one point of failure such as letting

1246
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,799
users click on everything

1247
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:48,160
that's as stupid as you know the other

1248
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,040
way around

1249
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:53,200
so anyway most important do a

1250
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,359
post-mortem go back analyze the incident

1251
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,279
what caused the incident what enabled it

1252
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:59,359
but here's the critical factor the

1253
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:02,560
proximity of the incident

1254
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:05,440
is not the cause of the incident

1255
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,720
you know the proximity is the symptom of

1256
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,440
the incident

1257
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,839
and you have to figure out what led to

1258
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,760
that

1259
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,759
incident from happening act the

1260
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,040
proximity and then figure out

1261
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,520
after the proximity of the error or the

1262
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,920
proxy

1263
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:22,079
the proximity of the initiation what

1264
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,319
could have stopped that

1265
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,200
and you know you go back and you figure

1266
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:27,279
out okay

1267
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,279
how did we get lucky that's another key

1268
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,640
factor what stopped the attack from

1269
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,720
being worse

1270
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,319
what made the attack better where could

1271
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:37,040
we have detected the attack

1272
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:38,560
and so on because this is your best

1273
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,960
incidents i hate to say

1274
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,720
you know art can be a hidden blessing if

1275
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,400
you have a low level incident in some

1276
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,640
ways the twitter hack

1277
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,560
where you had this teenager doing a

1278
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,359
vision attack called a mastermind

1279
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,160
because

1280
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:53,440
the security was incompetent but you

1281
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,160
know in the twitter hack

1282
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,760
for all you know you had this teenager

1283
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,759
finding this major problem and

1284
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,280
essentially just selling it for other

1285
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,160
people to do bitcoin

1286
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,760
theft in theory if something like this

1287
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,960
happened like somebody took over

1288
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,880
biden obama's and trump's twitter

1289
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,599
accounts at just the wrong moment in

1290
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,480
time

1291
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:15,760
that could be election meddling in a

1292
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,319
major way

1293
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,960
and perhaps this idiot teenager who did

1294
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:21,520
this

1295
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,040
not the mastermind but the idiot went

1296
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,359
ahead

1297
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,160
and you know the the discussion and the

1298
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:28,480
investigation

1299
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:30,000
might have saved much more damage than

1300
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,640
could have otherwise been done should

1301
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,400
russians iranian chinese or whoever else

1302
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,040
wanted to manipulate the election at the

1303
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,640
wrong moment again doing a post-mortem

1304
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,640
that might sound like a lot of work but

1305
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,640
safety science does it every time

1306
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,720
accounting if you have a large loss

1307
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,560
there's a whole bunch of accountants

1308
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,399
there's a whole bunch of cfos and

1309
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,359
consultants that come in and figure out

1310
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,760
why these things

1311
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:54,000
why a major laws happen there's an

1312
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,040
outage in operations again like

1313
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,040
for example what happened with

1314
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:59,920
cloudflare a few months ago

1315
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,400
you know there's like major analysis on

1316
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,400
why

1317
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,480
there were lots of losses in cyber

1318
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,000
security you know it's like oh that's

1319
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,839
the stupid user

1320
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,520
you know what we can't stop that stupid

1321
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:11,359
user no you can

1322
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,720
stop the stupid user or you're the

1323
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:14,560
stupid one

1324
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,319
anyway like i mentioned before if you're

1325
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,920
stopping nine well

1326
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:19,839
users are ninety percent of the

1327
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,760
incidents and if you can stop

1328
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:23,599
or what i mean by ninety 90 of the

1329
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:26,160
incidents 90

1330
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:28,079
of incidents involve users as the

1331
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:30,078
primary attack vector in other words

1332
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,760
they're the way into the system

1333
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,839
and the reason the other way in is not

1334
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,440
because the users are stupid

1335
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:37,520
but because you're stupid in

1336
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,400
constructing the protections around the

1337
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,560
user

1338
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,760
and if you can nail that down and stop

1339
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,040
that 90 percent

1340
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,280
odds are pretty good you're going to

1341
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:50,400
stop the other 10 as well

1342
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:53,040
um i use the example of ceo fraud w-2 um

1343
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,720
corncon you're likely all u.s people but

1344
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:58,160
you know think of it this way

1345
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:00,319
um you go ahead and you decide to

1346
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:02,078
for example a criminal goes ahead and

1347
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:03,119
they send in a message saying i'm the

1348
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,240
ceo

1349
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:08,480
i need you mr low-level hr person to

1350
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,439
send my new accounting firm all the w-2

1351
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,240
information

1352
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,800
as an example and that attack goes

1353
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,240
through

1354
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,000
and then what happens is what should

1355
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:18,078
happen left to boom you should be doing

1356
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,800
email filtering maybe dmarc will weed

1357
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,440
this out

1358
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,040
your webca your your email filter should

1359
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,200
take the message away

1360
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,160
likewise you should tag messages as

1361
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,759
external

1362
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,399
if they're coming from outside the

1363
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,880
company it's possible that some bad guy

1364
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,480
might

1365
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,400
compromise email accounts that's a

1366
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,000
different sequence but generally if

1367
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,280
they're coming from outside the company

1368
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,280
and sending this in

1369
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,119
you should give start filtering out

1370
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,359
these attacks as best you can

1371
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:44,960
and then providing for a user experience

1372
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:47,359
simultaneously that we

1373
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:48,480
you know gives the users at least a

1374
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,400
fighting chance

1375
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,680
but then when it gets to the user for a

1376
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,440
w-2 thing

1377
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,279
you know you you shouldn't have a

1378
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,079
low-level person randomly saying you

1379
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,640
know what

1380
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:01,119
hey the ceo has reached out to me

1381
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:03,680
personally i'm going to send out pii

1382
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,240
personally identifiable information

1383
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,078
again

1384
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,399
that should not be the case you should

1385
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,079
not have a low level person

1386
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,160
being on the front line against the

1387
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,079
trained criminal sociopath who wants to

1388
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,759
steal millions of dollars

1389
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,760
no matter what so what should the below

1390
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,280
level person do they're like this is a

1391
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,119
release of pii

1392
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,800
i can't do that the only person who

1393
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,319
could do that's the head of hr

1394
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,720
they also need general counsel

1395
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:28,400
protection what i'm at a low-level

1396
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,879
analyst going to do i don't care if it's

1397
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,119
the ceo i'm giving it to the head of hr

1398
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,960
and they're going to make a decision and

1399
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,599
then if they make the decision and then

1400
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,839
they can

1401
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,040
for example convince the general counsel

1402
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:41,680
to release it

1403
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:43,200
i hate to say it but the criminal might

1404
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:47,440
have earned that

1405
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:49,359
crime the reality of the situation is

1406
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,960
that's not going to happen most of the

1407
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:52,078
time it's going to be filtered out

1408
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,000
somebody's going to say hey wait a

1409
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:55,359
second this isn't from the ceo let's

1410
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
check this out

1411
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:59,759
but either way let's assume that somehow

1412
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,720
the criminal goes ahead and does

1413
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,119
all this and gets the general counsel to

1414
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,279
approve

1415
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:06,720
everything you should be able to have

1416
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,920
write a boom there's warnings of

1417
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,480
attaching the file

1418
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,640
data leak prevention software goes ahead

1419
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,960
and filters out the attachment before it

1420
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:18,160
gets sent out of the company and so on

1421
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:20,160
so people can look at this is a systems

1422
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,759
approach and that's the key term a

1423
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,920
systems approach

1424
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,680
to stopping what i'm referring to is

1425
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:28,079
user initiated loss

1426
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:30,160
you might refer to it as stupidity but

1427
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:33,440
likewise if you look at it this way

1428
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:36,558
handling pii handling a pii

1429
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:39,040
you know in general can

1430
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:41,200
not just stop this w-2 fraud but a

1431
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,800
variety of different types of attacks

1432
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:45,279
against the organization

1433
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,400
data leak prevention might stop the w-2

1434
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,160
type of attack

1435
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,559
but it's also going to stop lots of

1436
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,319
things like customer data leaking out

1437
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,839
sensitive information being sent out

1438
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:56,079
accidentally and so on it's going to

1439
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:57,920
stop a whole bunch of different laws

1440
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,760
filtering of incoming messages on

1441
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,240
servers again stops so much

1442
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,280
tagging a mail is external can stop a

1443
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:06,000
lot of

1444
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:08,000
random attacks against your organization

1445
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
warning of attachments could be like hey

1446
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,559
wait a second i wouldn't do this

1447
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,800
it's gonna again there's so much overlap

1448
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:16,000
if you start looking at one type of user

1449
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,599
initiated loss

1450
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,839
compared to losses across your

1451
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:22,160
organization i've already beat this to

1452
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:23,920
death but if you can mitigate 90

1453
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,920
you're gonna probably catch a lot of the

1454
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,520
remaining 10 as well

1455
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,520
not just because we're dealing with a

1456
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,640
user error but because we've

1457
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:35,200
hardened the system as a whole that's

1458
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:37,920
the key factor we're not looking at it

1459
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:40,078
as a user related issue we're looking at

1460
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,079
it as a systems issue and as a result

1461
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:44,000
we've hardened the whole system

1462
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:45,520
now awareness is still mandatory i

1463
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,800
mentioned this everybody says oh

1464
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,720
you just went through a whole bunch of

1465
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,839
reasons why awareness is like

1466
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:54,319
not as valuable as addressing the system

1467
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:56,078
here's the thing everything along the

1468
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:58,800
way will fail

1469
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:00,400
awareness is a good risk reduction tool

1470
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,040
for a user to click on a phishing

1471
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,720
message

1472
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:05,920
your entire pre left the boom technology

1473
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,480
has to fail

1474
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,280
pretty much you allowed a bad message to

1475
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,960
get through

1476
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:14,000
so in other words your email filtering

1477
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,800
did nothing the expensive email gateway

1478
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,280
did nothing

1479
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,359
but if a user is looking at it a user

1480
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,599
can in the right circumstances that i've

1481
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:24,960
been involved in situations like this

1482
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:27,520
can stop millions of dollars of damage

1483
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,040
proactively so you've got to go ahead

1484
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,000
and make sure users know how to do

1485
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,680
everything right

1486
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,680
every time a user doesn't click on a

1487
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,440
phishing message every time a user

1488
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:38,000
doesn't open up their spam file

1489
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,119
every time users do things right it's a

1490
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,280
success story

1491
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:43,359
but we don't report on that because you

1492
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,119
really again left the boom has failed

1493
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:46,799
and you can't make sure write a boom is

1494
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,760
any gonna be any more successful and

1495
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,520
left to boom

1496
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,920
so you got to make sure you do risk

1497
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:53,599
reduction throughout the entire chain of

1498
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,680
events

1499
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:57,280
anyway and this is the key thing are you

1500
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:59,839
throwing around tactics

1501
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,440
or do you have a strategy because again

1502
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:03,279
like i mentioned before you have one

1503
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,720
team that might do email gateways you

1504
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,160
have another team doing awareness you

1505
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,839
have another team doing

1506
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,640
daily prevention and the other

1507
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:14,000
technologies who's looking at this

1508
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,640
as a strategy again all too frequently

1509
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,119
you have

1510
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:19,440
csos and other people and again they're

1511
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:21,200
trying to make the most of their budget

1512
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,040
but they have to look at things a

1513
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,759
different way giving the scope of the

1514
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,400
errors and

1515
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:28,559
losses that we're looking at so again

1516
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:31,520
look to pursue a strategy

1517
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:33,119
of mitigating user initiated loss and

1518
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:35,280
you're going to stop a lot of damage now

1519
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:36,960
again the most important takeaway

1520
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,960
you know here's the key thing i didn't

1521
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,079
mention this but you want to make sure a

1522
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,160
canary doesn't just

1523
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,280
die from a heart attack it would be bad

1524
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,520
if you empty out an

1525
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:48,000
entire coal mine and it just so happens

1526
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:51,280
the canary had a heart attack that's bad

1527
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,119
on the other hand the canary is just the

1528
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,359
proximity of the problem

1529
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,400
in general you don't want healthier

1530
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:58,480
canaries

1531
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,160
you want to make sure canary dies when

1532
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,960
they're supposed to die

1533
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,879
likewise you know your users are just

1534
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,960
part of the system and no you don't want

1535
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,800
your users to die

1536
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,800
but in the reality you don't want them

1537
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:13,119
to make an error but if they make an

1538
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,960
error the error is just a result of the

1539
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:18,559
entire system

1540
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:20,880
not their own actions and here's the key

1541
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:22,960
takeaway of the entire presentation my

1542
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,319
new book you can stop stupid is now

1543

1549
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:39,920
