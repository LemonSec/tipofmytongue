1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,960
and i'm starting

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,280
all right good afternoon i'd like to

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,960
introduce richard marshall

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:16,720
check out richard's bio for more details

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:20,080
uh i've known rich for geez

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:23,038
probably 12 years and uh

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,560
of an amazing background and a real

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,240
great perspective on the industry

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,240
so let me

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,040
allow richard to start his presentation

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,160
if you think kobit was bad

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,480
let me share the slides here and we'll

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:44,879
get going thank you

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:46,800
thank you thank you john

15
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,440
all right i guess i'm in control on my

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,800
slides and i'll start my presentation

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,000
uh at the onset i need i need to thank

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,599
uh should i start talking now john um

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,039
you may need to request control but if

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,039
you have control then you're all set

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:13,839
all right i'm requesting control now

22
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,840
and just tell me when to start talking

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,839
yup go right ahead all right uh john

24
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,360
thank you very much for inviting me and

25
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,320
giving me the opportunity to make a

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,439
presentation

27
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,520
at corncon

28
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,960
as far as i'm concerned corncocon is

29
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,119
probably the

30
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,079
the best security conference in the

31
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,720
country

32
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,679
uh especially now but i've been involved

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,079
with you guys

34
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,320
for at least three or four years i was

35
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,119
there a couple of years ago and i'll

36
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,758
tell you

37
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,399
a hospitality and the opportunity to

38
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,640
meet with

39
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,240
fine folk out there is just absolutely

40
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,000
astounding

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,759
um i know those of you in the audience

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,079
are thinking it's kind of odd to

43
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,079
hear a presentation about modern day

44
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,880
cyber security from a guy who's

45
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,520
been in the business over 25 years uh

46
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,600
but i've

47
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,920
been speaking a lot at black hat and

48
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,679
defcon that's where john and i first met

49
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,520
and then we further submitted our

50
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,200
relationship at uh

51
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,200
the rsa conferences and uh

52
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,839
so we've been had a close working

53
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,879
relationship all of these years

54
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:24,080
but uh probably the

55
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:27,359
the best experience we've had together

56
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,000
was at corncon a couple of years ago

57
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,760
a great group of people it was wonderful

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,120
to be live with everyone

59
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,160
and i certainly look forward to being

60
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,920
able to do that again next year

61
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,079
there's just something about the

62
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,879
camaraderie of everyone

63
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,080
being together and sharing ideas all

64
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,200
right for those of you in the audience i

65
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,959
don't know whether you can

66
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,480
respond to any of my questions but i'll

67
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,400
just assume that you can

68
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,160
i want you to take a very close look at

69
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,040
this first slide

70
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,720
and tell me what's wrong with it tell me

71
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,400
what's missing

72
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,400
tell me what needs to be corrected

73
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,760
well i'm not going to wait forever for

74
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,920
an answer so i'll help you with this

75
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,760
most analysts when they're looking at a

76
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,119
screen trying to find

77
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,840
attacks look at tremendo look at details

78
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,680
which is very very important but it's

79
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,879
also very important that you note the

80
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,360
obvious

81
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,480
and so this slide was prepared with a

82
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,000
defect

83
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,640
initially to help point out the fact

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,120
that you need to look for the obvious if

85
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,279
you look down here at

86
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,040
my name you'll see that there's a dot

87
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,519
missing from the l

88
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,200
most people don't see that hardly anyone

89
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:45,200
will see that

90
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:50,238
but i use that to illustrate the point

91
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:53,359
that uh don't overlook the obvious

92
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,200
that's it's very critical uh to make

93
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,680
sure you catch everything

94
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,679
slide

95
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,239
all right

96
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,879
all right trying to move to the next

97
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,159
slide

98
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,239
i know it's going to take a little bit

99
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,359
of time here we are here's today's

100
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,639
objective

101
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,799
uh you know we're dealing with a

102
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,639
completely new situation with

103
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:25,120
uh the situation uh associated with

104
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,880
everyone having to stay home

105
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,880
and so we're accustomed to working in

106
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,240
islands of security you know offices

107
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,479
where everything is

108
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,080
nailed down we're very comfortable with

109
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,359
the security arrangement that we're

110
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,000
working with

111
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,360
and we think we have that under control

112
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,759
at least we have it

113
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,479
uh under control a lot better than now

114
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,240
so we

115
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,320
are in a position where we're moving

116
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,759
from islands of security as i like to

117
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,400
refer to them

118
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,479
to lily pads of vulnerability now what

119
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,840
do i mean by lily pads of

120
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:59,680
vulnerability everyone or a

121
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:04,479
large number of people

122
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,479
are working from home now

123
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,880
and it's creating

124
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,479
quite a few problems together but

125
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,280
they're also involved in shareware

126
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,639
everybody's using the same wi-fi system

127
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,479
and when they're all using

128
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,360
the same wi-fi system they're not all

129
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,039
paying attention to security

130
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,880
considerations children don't have any

131
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,320
choice they need to be on the internet

132
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,919
to do their homework

133
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:32,719
uh to attend class as it were

134
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,919
and those that are working from home

135
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,919
don't have the same

136
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,039
security procedures built into their

137
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,799
home system that they do in the office

138
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,400
while when they're in the office they

139
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,039
realize that the security

140
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,880
that's built into their system is going

141
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,639
to help protect them

142
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,320
but when they're at home and they don't

143
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,000
have that built-in protection

144
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,840
then that opens a lot of doors for

145
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,400
nefarious activity

146
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,520
and quite a bit of nefarious activities

147
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,520
ongoing

148
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,880
so what i'm going to try to provide

149
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:06,479
today is

150
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,479
what i've stated in the objective

151
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,840
and uh let's work together

152
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,479
to try to reach that objective

153
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,440
now the next objective is i'm working

154
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:23,039
from home so it's a little slow

155
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:26,479
uh let's see we jumped ahead

156
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:35,840
oh this is going too fast

157
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:37,440
let's go back a few slides

158
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:49,840
well it looks like everything's going to

159
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:49,840
happen at one time

160
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,680
and i'm going to ask you to take over uh

161
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,800
this thing is

162
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,800
beyond my control

163
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,960
that's going to relinquish control of

164
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,960
this

165
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:24,159
we'll make this work all right

166
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,159
shall i give up remote control now

167
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,880
yeah i have i have control would you

168
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,880
like me to okay

169
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:36,080
yeah go back to uh the second slide

170
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,479
all right i'm giving up remote control

171
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,479
to you

172
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,319
i don't know why i jumped ahead

173
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:50,479
we got this one yeah keep going back no

174
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,479
uh the actual second slide in the deck

175
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,840
keep going back

176
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,120
here okay keep going back

177
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,878
this one background okay yeah that's

178
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,080
this one yeah

179
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,840
yes all right a little bit of background

180
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,960
on this old guy i formerly was the

181
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,638
associate general counsel through

182
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,560
promotion system security or information

183
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,960
insurance at nsa

184
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,319
why is that important it was there that

185
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,799
i learned to be a hacker

186
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,959
i i was trained by nsa to be a hacker i

187
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,599
was halfway decent then i'm worthless

188
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,598
now

189
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,360
of course that was 40 years ago and 40

190
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,399
pounds ago

191
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,640
when i had a ponytail and as you can see

192
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,680
i don't have that much hair left

193
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,800
uh but i still am familiar with the

194
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,599
concepts that

195
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,040
was in my job at nsa was i was a legal

196
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,200
architect for the nation's first

197
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,959
information warfare exercise called

198
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,959
eligible receiver 97.

199
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,239
you can look it up on the internet there

200
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,880
have been several books that have been

201
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,440
written about

202
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,279
our participation in that but basically

203
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,480
we took a group of about

204
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,760
uh 15 15 to 24

205
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,240
pretty seasoned hackers

206
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,439
and we were designed to attack a dod

207
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,839
system

208
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,480
and my job was to make sure we could do

209
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,839
it legally without having to go to jail

210
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,760
because if you violate title 18 it's uh

211
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,200
it's usually a felony

212
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:30,480
and going to jail is not a very good

213
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,040
career move for most people but we did

214
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,800
not use

215
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,480
anything special and that's the point i

216
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,079
want to emphasize here

217
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,680
we did not use anything that was unique

218
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,399
to nsa

219
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,560
in terms of hacking all of the hacking

220
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,000
techniques that we used we downloaded

221
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,359
from the internet

222
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,720
now this was back in 1997

223
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,839
probably before many of you were born

224
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,640
but you can still download very very

225
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,320
from the internet today and that's a

226
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,760
point to remember

227
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,000
the adversaries are many they're all

228
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,480
over

229
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,440
the world they're dedicated they're

230
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,800
focused

231
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:14,320
they share information attack profiles

232
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:17,359
very generously so the

233
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:21,120
the threshold the attack surface

234
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,880
is very very large uh after i left that

235
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,240
i worked at the white house developing

236
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,439
some policies on

237
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,440
how to protect the critical

238
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,360
infrastructure and

239
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,279
cyber security initiatives and i

240
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,640
mentioned this point because

241
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,720
had those policies been implemented as

242
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,399
they were originally drafted

243
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,920
i think we could have avoided a lot of

244
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,959
the problems that we're experiencing

245
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,680
today

246
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,399
but unfortunately they were over

247
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,839
coordinated

248
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,600
everybody in the government wanted to

249
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,279
have their piece of the pie

250
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,600
and so things were diluted in terms of

251
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,399
strength

252
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,839
and so we lost an opportunity maybe

253
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,200
someday that'll come back and i

254
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,279
i think we're starting to get a better

255
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,120
hand on it now both with the department

256
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,920
of homeland security and

257
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,040
and the national security agency and it

258
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,560
was at at the

259
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,240
department of homeland security that i

260
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,119
was a director of global cyber security

261
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,959
management

262
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,440
which is an absolutely fascinating

263
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,880
opportunity i worked with

264
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,200
25 to 30 young individuals

265
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,200
they were young enough to be my children

266
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,200
actually

267
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,200
every one of them had a master's degree

268
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,959
in computer security

269
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,680
and i think i learned as much from them

270
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:34,800
as as anyone possibly could

271
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,399
i am an advisor to a number of boards

272
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,120
and national and international

273
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,680
corporations i thoroughly enjoy that

274
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,040
i also serve on a number of boards of

275
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,079
startups

276
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,719
that i do gratuitously

277
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,000
pro bono just to help these young folks

278
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,079
get started

279
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,839
let's go to the next slide john and

280
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,839
sorry i can't do this a little smoother

281
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,480
all right the focus here is how to keep

282
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,279
hackers out of your system

283
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,000
and uh you know the previous

284
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,920
presentation

285
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,120
which i thought was very very good about

286
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,399
malware

287
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,200
uh focuses on the persistent threat that

288
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,880
continues

289
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,959
day in and day out and of course it's

290
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,240
more critical now that we are working

291
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,839
from home

292
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,560
so one of the first things you need to

293
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,040
do is to identify

294
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,479
and correct your vulnerabilities and

295
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,519
that means you've got to look very

296
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,079
closely

297
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,519
at who you're connected to how you're

298
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,120
connected with them

299
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,880
because there are a number of ways that

300
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,800
the attacker can come in and take

301
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,839
advantage of you

302
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,519
one of the best things you can do in

303
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,560
terms of time

304
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:54,399
effort energy is to keep

305
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,719
your system patched we call it patch

306
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,639
tuesday when microsoft

307
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,000
comes out with their latest list of

308
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,440
patches

309
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,720
and all too often most

310
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,240
experts are a little late in installing

311
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,240
those patches

312
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,040
so while we may call it patch tuesday

313
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,760
the adversary calls it hacker wednesday

314
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,199
they get this same list of patches and

315
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,319
they take advantage of it

316
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,880
right away because they know we don't

317
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,360
always

318
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,959
patch our systems and this is

319
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,480
particularly true

320
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,959
when you're dealing with the financial

321
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,160
services sector

322
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:35,199
uh banks and other complex entities

323
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,839
have so many systems operating that is

324
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,639
before they install a patch they want to

325
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,800
review

326
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,880
the patch to make sure it doesn't have

327
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,519
any adverse impact on the operating

328
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,880
system

329
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,839
that's also true with the islands of

330
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,399
security not necessarily true with the

331
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,760
pattern

332
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,760
with what i call the lily pads of

333
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,680
vulnerability so

334
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,120
when you're at home you're your own

335
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,920
system administrator

336
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,959
when you're operating from home so it's

337
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,599
important

338
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,079
to you it's incumbent on you to make

339
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,160
sure you

340
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,479
patch your systems as soon as the patch

341
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:10,160
comes out that'll certainly help things

342
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,160
okay john ready for the next slide

343
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,439
all right this is a depiction of the

344
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,079
attack origins the

345
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,680
tax types et cetera and you'll see that

346
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,160
they're coming from all over the world

347
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,880
areas that you don't necessarily think

348
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,839
are going to be

349
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,800
that aggressive in attacking the united

350
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,360
states

351
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,719
now this depicts attacks on the united

352
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,279
states they're also attacking

353
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,600
europe et cetera but it's amazing to see

354
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,120
where all of these attacks are coming

355
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,600
from

356
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,399
uh you'll notice most of them are coming

357
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,519
from uh

358
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:48,720
china uh a few from russia

359
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:52,160
uh we also have some attacks coming from

360
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,199
uh western europe but just because the

361
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,439
attacks are

362
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,120
shown to be coming from western europe

363
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,480
doesn't necessarily mean that's where

364
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,440
they originated

365
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,399
all too often they originate in russia

366
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,079
or china

367
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,079
and then they're spoofed is coming from

368
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:09,279
western europe or indeed

369
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,719
from south america okay let's move along

370
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,240
to the next slide john

371
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,959
thank you for your help all right

372
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,000
i love this slide uh this is a

373
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,518
modification

374
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,240
of a thing called night lights it shows

375
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,519
where electricity is in the world

376
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,959
and the point to remember here is that

377
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,519
where there's light

378
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:33,680
there's an opportunity for a hacker and

379
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,519
you'll notice there's a tremendous

380
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,439
amount of light in the united states and

381
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:41,040
of course northern europe

382
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:45,279
and western europe but also look at

383
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:48,319
the activity in india and in china

384
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:52,720
it's amazing and then of course this is

385
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:55,519
24 hours a day do not make the mistake

386
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,880
of underestimating your adversary

387
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,839
they're intelligent

388
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,199
they're smart they're aggressive they

389
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,199
focus on attacks

390
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,240
over and over again they don't have that

391
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,880
much else to do

392
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,320
they don't have jobs so the easiest way

393
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,959
for them to make money

394
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,000
is to attack you and take advantage of

395
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,518
those systems

396
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,240
so they're highly motivated to do that

397
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:23,839
all right next one we're moving right

398
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,839
along here john

399
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,519
all right i know this is a busy looking

400
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,120
slide uh but this is the atomy of a

401
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,680
target data breach

402
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,680
and if you follow along you know numbers

403
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,680
one two three four and five i'll give

404
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,560
you an opportunity to

405
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,319
to read the notes as these take place

406
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,560
and you can see that these are

407
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:50,800
very sophisticated attacks um and again

408
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,880
these come from areas where you would

409
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,758
not ordinarily expect them to be that

410
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,560
skillful

411
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,040
and that technically qualified but

412
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,800
obviously they definitely are

413
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,800
one of the easiest ways is to come in

414
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,959
through a third party contractor we've

415
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,879
seen that over and over again

416
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,079
one of the more egregious examples was

417
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,199
when they

418
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,079
uh came in through an air conditioning

419
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,280
system

420
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:17,119
and then i was able to get in and

421
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,599
take over the system they do it

422
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,520
gradually they do it slowly

423
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,039
they don't want to be called they don't

424
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,799
want to be detected

425
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,720
they want to do a complete internal

426
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,760
survey of your system

427
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,559
take what they want take what they need

428
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,440
and normally when they exfiltrate it

429
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,879
it's done

430
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,320
in the middle of the night when you're

431
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,080
least expected uh it's done low and slow

432
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,760
and it's encrypted so it's very

433
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,879
difficult for you to catch it

434
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,120
as they're going out moral of the story

435
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,480
catch them coming in catch them when

436
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,039
they're inside

437
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,360
stop them from taking your data next

438
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,360
please

439
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,720
all right exploits unfold in stages as

440
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,440
we illustrated in the previous slide

441
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,200
on the right screen you'll see activity

442
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,360
actually taking place

443
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,919
one of the things they first do is is

444
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:13,360
reconnaissance and they take their time

445
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,799
doing that they're looking at system

446
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,879
weaknesses

447
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,520
and i also want to exploit personnel

448
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,520
weaknesses

449
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,559
and here's where it gets become

450
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:29,840
important both

451
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,840
in the island of security and on the

452
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,150
[Music]

453
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,840
uh

454
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,919
rich i think you're uh your video and

455
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:11,840
audio uh

456
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:11,840
froze up there

457
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:25,840
all right i will uh we'll get

458
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,840
we'll get rich back in here

459
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:33,840
you can watch the animation let me

460
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,840
get him added back in looks like he just

461
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,840
dropped

462
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,639
okay there we go rich you're back

463
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,399
and once they get in then they start you

464
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,039
taking advantage of

465
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,039
user privileges they continue the

466
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,520
reconnaissance the target data is

467
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,240
filtrated they may remain in retained

468
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,240
control

469
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:21,039
systems and keep visiting

470
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:23,440
so it's incumbent upon you to keep

471
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:26,960
monitoring and making sure you can keep

472
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,960
them from coming in sometime

473
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:38,080
all right you want the next slide

474
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,080
uh yes please yes

475
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,360
yeah and this is not a site that you

476
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,600
want to see

477
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,639
on your screen that shows that you've

478
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,879
been hacked and

479
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,880
uh

480
00:20:52,960 --> 00:21:00,840
you don't always see this but when you

481
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:03,840
do see this your heart stops next slide

482
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,840
please

483
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,960
all right be alert to it as as the

484
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,159
previous presenter

485
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,200
said you know the the ones that are

486
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,600
doing the attacks

487
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,640
are still using their old technical

488
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,399
systems

489
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:22,320
to come and attack you they're look

490
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,039
in the past they look for an unwitting

491
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,639
executive they don't have to do that now

492
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,120
again because you're on the islands of

493
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,960
vulnerability anyone that is using their

494
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,479
system from home

495
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:38,320
can be subject to an inviting uh

496
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,600
email to open it up and once you open up

497
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,480
a bad email

498
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,320
then you get malicious traffic coming in

499
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:48,000
and they're very skilled

500
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:51,120
at using remote administrative tools um

501
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,120
and they can take care of

502
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,880
take advantage of your systems in

503
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,280
multiple ways

504
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,799
and open you to buffer overflows and

505
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,158
other infectionary

506
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:05,039
infections very dangerous situation

507
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,039
next slide please

508
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:15,520
all right many attacks are tailored

509
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,880
tailored specifically to attack your

510
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,639
particular system

511
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,960
now remember they cut their teeth on

512
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,120
going after very sophisticated systems

513
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,159
in the islands of security the office

514
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,000
environment

515
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,919
but now that they're taking advantage of

516
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,720
the lily pads of vulnerability

517
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,720
they still use their polished techniques

518
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,280
but it's much easier for them to

519
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,480
come in and take advantage of the home

520
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,918
system

521
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,559
and then from the home system then they

522
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,760
can hop

523
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:46,399
into the more sophisticated systems

524
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,120
at the office so you you'd be very

525
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,799
careful

526
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,719
system administrators need to be very

527
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,280
careful particularly with traffic coming

528
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,600
from home

529
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,559
systems to make sure that a bad guy or a

530
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,320
bad gal

531
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,760
is not coming in to take advantage of

532
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,799
your situation

533
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,720
uh on the left

534
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,960
under the caption of many attacks are

535
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,799
tailored there are important notes to

536
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:13,039
take advantage of once

537
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:17,918
again we notice that hvac systems

538
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:20,640
often provide unexpected pathways

539
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,320
hackers do not need to rely on back

540
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,559
doors or see road days

541
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,918
that they can attack they've polished

542
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,399
they've practiced they know how to get

543
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,480
in

544
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,679
and it's much easier to attack the home

545
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,320
user than it is

546
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,919
the office user but remember once they

547
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,760
get into the home user it makes it a lot

548
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,640
easier for them to get into the office

549
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,640
next slide please

550
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:52,080
all right this is okay here we go

551
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:55,440
here it's important to understand

552
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:58,399
everything about your system

553
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,360
because the bad guys and gals don't need

554
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,919
anything major

555
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,760
they they're very happy to look for

556
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:07,200
something small and exploit that

557
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:10,000
something that's overlooked and so there

558
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,799
they'll use hard-coded passwords they

559
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,370
look for clear

560
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,799
text to take advantage of again

561
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:18,158
[Music]

562
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:20,639
using legacy protocols they're

563
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,240
very dangerous to be exploited looking

564
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,159
for temporary cracks

565
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,360
and here's the other one to be alert

566
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,320
it's called byod

567
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,840
bring your own disaster people like to

568
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,439
say bring your own device but it's

569
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,320
really bring your own disaster

570
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,240
and we see that more and more not just

571
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,360
from the home user

572
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,760
uh using their home computer but

573
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,799
they're also using their ipads to

574
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,158
connect

575
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:49,679
and particularly their iphones which are

576
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:52,720
well their mobile devices

577
00:24:49,679 --> 00:25:01,840
which are extremely vulnerable okay

578
00:24:52,720 --> 00:25:01,840
next slide please

579
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,679
next slide john

580
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:15,840
yeah it's it's up okay yeah okay yeah uh

581
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,840
they're a little slow okay

582
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:22,320
limit your access privileges uh

583
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:24,159
to those that really need it don't give

584
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,600
it across the board just to be nice to

585
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,679
people

586
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,320
if they don't need access to a certain

587
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,080
line and don't let them have it

588
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,360
and i'm going to beat the drama on

589
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,639
patching your systems

590
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:40,559
that 99 of the vulnerabilities

591
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:43,279
i've read complete many times on surveys

592
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:45,678
if you have your system properly patched

593
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,360
you reduce the opportunity significantly

594
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:51,360
for someone to come in and

595
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,360
take advantage of the situation

596
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,200
and it's also very important for the

597
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,799
system administrator and it puts

598
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,559
a lot of pressure on the system

599
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,039
administrator

600
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,720
to actually read the logs so many things

601
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,158
are automated now that we have a

602
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,159
tendency to say

603
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,840
well when the alarm goes off i'll pay

604
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:16,080
attention

605
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:19,520
uh but they're not full proof

606
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:22,240
so the system administrator really has a

607
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,799
tough job to read the logs to know

608
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,440
what's going on to know what to do

609
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:29,360
and that's increasingly important now

610
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:39,840
that the home systems are now connected

611
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:39,840
to the office systems next slide please

612
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,960
all right i love this depiction and this

613
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:47,039
is the last slide

614
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,000
but here you see what is viewed as a

615
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,480
firewall

616
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,279
and people have very interesting ways to

617
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,440
get through

618
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,720
that firewall some of them are very

619
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,480
sophisticated

620
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,000
but some of them are very plain just

621
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,279
kind of walking around it

622
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,200
as we've seen in this depiction so

623
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,960
i just caution you to be extra special

624
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,799
careful out there

625
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,440
especially those that are working from

626
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:11,039
home especially those that are working

627
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,640
in an office and are monitoring the

628
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,919
activities of people who are working

629
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,440
from home

630
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:20,240
realize that because of covert 19

631
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,279
we're at home but the adversaries at

632
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,039
home too

633
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,120
they're working from home but they're

634
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:27,520
very sophisticated in their developed

635
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,039
attack techniques and certainly are

636
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,960
having a field day

637
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,960
coming in not only with ransomware

638
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,320
but also attacks to disable the 911

639
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,279
systems for a while we've had that

640
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,760
problem

641
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:43,200
and and more importantly we've had some

642
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,480
shutdowns

643
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,080
uh associated with power systems here in

644
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,640
the united states

645
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,520
so the world is becoming increasingly

646
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,760
vulnerable

647
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,120
uh particularly because of kobe 19 and

648
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,120
it just behooves all of us to work

649
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,600
together to help protect each other

650
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,879
to prevent a bigger cyber disaster that

651
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,799
may happen

652
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,799
john i thank you very much for letting

653
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:09,200
me have the opportunity to

654
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:12,480
share the opportunity to uh

655
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,960
converse with these fine folk and i know

656
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,760
we're

657
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,000
pretty close on time but i'm available

658
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,399
to

659
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,159
answer questions that i that you think i

660
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,320
might be able to answer don't

661
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,159
don't embarrass me by asking something

662
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,480
too hard

663
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,480
uh but i'm happy to try to answer

664
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,720
questions as they come up

665
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,679
uh you know please put any questions you

666
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,480
might have into the

667
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,480
q a window

668
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,479
maybe i'll be lucky like the last guy

669
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,480
and not good questions

670
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,919
well i i'm sure there will be lots of

671
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,159
questions and it's too bad we're not in

672
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:48,000
person so that people could sit down and

673
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,000
share a drink and talk to you right that

674
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,240
was that was what was so much fun

675
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,840
i think when you were here last oh gosh

676
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,320
being able to sit down with the whole

677
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:59,439
audience the whole crowd afterwards

678
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:02,158
and uh and chat and have a drink and

679
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,120
get to meet their families oh that was

680
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,320
great and

681
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,239
you know one of the things that i

682
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,918
enjoyed uh

683
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:13,200
the last time i was there i

684
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:16,880
talked to because there were a lot of

685
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:19,039
parent children combos in the audience

686
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,240
and i was very encouraged to see the

687
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,240
parents being there

688
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,640
with their children and encouraging them

689
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,520
to go into the i.t arena

690
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,440
it's a growth industry i mean uh all of

691
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,840
the presenters will agree with that

692
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,880
it's a growth industry and i commented

693
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,158
on the fact that

694
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:39,039
i took my son uh who was

695
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,320
a young teenager at the time with me

696
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:44,399
when i went to

697
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:47,678
black hat and defcon and put him to work

698
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:50,000
uh he was basically serving as a

699
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,799
a guide to take speakers to the

700
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,840
particular

701
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,158
forum where they would give

702
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,039
presentations

703
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,919
he got really excited about i.t and now

704
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,640
he's an i.t

705
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,240
wizard and i'm very proud of the fact of

706
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,120
what he's done

707
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,600
and i should give him a as they say in

708
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,600
young people's language a shout out

709
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,199
to the fact that he helped put together

710
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,158
the technical aspects

711
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,880
of this presentation so parents of the

712
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,440
audience

713
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,720
encourage your children to go into i.t

714
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,039
it's a growing field

715
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,360
it's a safe field you'll always have a

716
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:26,158
job thank you john

717
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,158
well rich we thank your staff one

718
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,399
question here from jake

719
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,480
he says once you're in cyber security

720
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:35,360
what is the best way to succeed

721
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,840
and move up through the ranks in your

722
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,840
opinion

723
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,279
well that's a great question regardless

724
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,600
of the field that you're in

725
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,720
number one do the very best job that you

726
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,918
can possibly do

727
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,120
be recognized for being successful and

728
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,080
competent

729
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:56,320
and responsive those are two critical

730
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,879
things

731
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,000
to be recognized and once you are

732
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,600
recognized

733
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,799
as being competent and responsive

734
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:10,719
then you have an opportunity to meet

735
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:13,840
more and more challenging environments

736
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,240
um i've

737
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,320
spoken a lot to senior managers about

738
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,200
this particular issue

739
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,760
and to a person they will say we're

740
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,600
always

741
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,600
on the lookout for talent

742
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,919
there never seems to be enough talent

743
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,159
there are a lot of people that can do

744
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:37,840
something but we need

745
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:41,120
people to do something special so

746
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:42,480
the point is to become very competent at

747
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,840
what you're doing

748
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,360
very responsive in what you're doing and

749
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,918
management will notice that

750
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,080
if they don't then you need to help them

751
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,320
understand what you're doing

752
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,158
do it in a polite and respectful way

753
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,158
initially if you have to be obnoxious

754
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,360
later then do it what do you have to

755
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,399
lose

756
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,678
but believe me managers that are doing

757
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,918
their jobs

758
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,120
are very sensitive to identifying people

759
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,279
who are competent

760
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,360
and responsive and they want to put them

761
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:14,960
in more challenging positions

762
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:17,519
managers want to keep their own job

763
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,640
and the only way they can keep their job

764
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,679
is to have

765
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:25,360
a performance

766
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:28,080
team that does well i hope that answers

767
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:31,039
your question satisfactorily

768
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,639
um we had another quick question here uh

769
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,720
i i say quick

770
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,000
kind of tongue-in-cheek the question is

771
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,080
where do you see

772
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,080
where do you see cryptography going in

773
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,439
the future

774
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:47,199
oh gosh um you know that

775
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,519
john if if i were there in iowa with you

776
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,240
this would be a topic for what we both

777
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:54,840
would refer to as a three-drink subject

778
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,840
uh we would talk about it long into the

779
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,840
night

780
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,240
there are so many advances in

781
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,799
cryptography now

782
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,080
uh i think one of the ones that's safest

783
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:10,000
to talk about

784
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:14,080
from my perspective uh is quantum

785
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,960
uh we're seeing great advances in that

786
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:19,678
not just from the united states but also

787
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,679
from china

788
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:27,360
uh if you were to press me on the point

789
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:30,799
which you obviously are doing i would

790
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,399
uh opine that i think cha probably has

791
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,480
the lead on that now

792
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,080
or at least they're are giving better

793
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,840
press about the fact that they think

794
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,840
they have the lead on that now

795
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,559
i am not a cryptographer cryptologist

796
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,519
uh but i'm very sensitive to the fact

797
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,559
that we need to

798
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,880
devote more resources

799
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,600
to advancing that technology so if

800
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,679
you're an

801
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,360
expert in that field or if you have an

802
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,200
interest in that field

803
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,639
there's a tremendous opportunity for you

804
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,440
to make great contributions

805
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,000
and i encourage you to do that all right

806
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,880
well

807
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
i think we need to uh cut this short

808
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,560
because

809
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,560
uh we're using zoom and i don't want

810
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,599
china to get offended rich

811
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,199
but uh we don't have we don't have

812
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,119
anything else in the in the q

813
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,560
a window for right now so let me just

814
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,919
thank you for coming this is really

815
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,679
super special that

816
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,960
that you would uh take the time to come

817
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,760
here and present

818
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,960
and uh just share with our audience um

819
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,560
obviously the

820
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,159
a lot of the people who are on have been

821
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,960
at corncon in the past

822
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,800
and uh remember uh meeting you in person

823
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,520
and having conversations and

824
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,639
so it's uh it's great to do this in a

825
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,918
virtual sense

826
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:48,320
so thanks again and uh you know we

827
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:51,679
