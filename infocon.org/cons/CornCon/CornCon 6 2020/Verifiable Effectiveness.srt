he's going to be speaking about

6
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,398
verifiable effectiveness

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,440
how to know your security program works

8
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,879
before the bad guys let you know

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,640

questions and so forth um

37
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,240
what i want to talk today about um i'm

38
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,000
going to start by talking about a story

39
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,199
or two because i i like stories stories

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,719
are good things

41
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,200
um a few years ago um i was

42
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,720
um you know sitting there one day

43
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,959
dealing with you know the day-to-day

44
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,879
grind that you you do as a cso

45
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,120
and i got a phone call it turned out

46
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,840
that somebody in our london office

47
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,200
um it turned out and then to be a

48
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,280
janitor in the building

49
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,440
had broken onto the floor forced the

50
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,840
locks grabbed three laptops and

51
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,720
and you know ran out to presumably sell

52
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,959
them

53
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,319
um we did you know the same thing you

54
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,599
always would expect to do with these

55
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,040
let's go through let's get the evidence

56
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,480
make sure the laptops were encrypted

57
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,640
we're all good laptop one yep

58
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,399
encrypted not a problem laptop two yep

59
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,518
encrypted not a problem laptop three

60
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,319
it's not showing up in our

61
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,160
in our um you know anti-malware

62
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,160
anti-virus console

63
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,359
okay why is it not showing up in the

64
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,840
anti-virus

65
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,560
um anti-malware console we didn't have

66
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,000
evidence

67
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,680
out there to show that it was encrypted

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,560
this was in the uk which means it's in

69
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,239
the eu it was based on whose laptop it

70
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,440
was there was likelihood that the

71
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,480
individuals whose laptop it was

72
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,720
had sensitive data on it so we have

73
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,879
three days timer under under gdpr three

74
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,800
days for us to go figure out and and

75
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,599
before we have to notify the regulators

76
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,040
on this and

77
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,720
frankly the regulators want to know even

78
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,280
before three days

79
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,040
um figuring out a laptop that no longer

80
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,080
is on your network whether or not it was

81
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,120
encrypted

82
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,040
is not a straightforward um activity

83
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,440
we couldn't figure it out in three days

84
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,359
so we had to notify the the ico under

85
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,959
gdpr to make sure that they

86
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,120
they know it in the end it turned out

87
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,319
the laptop was absolutely encrypted

88
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,840
we had really good we were able to pull

89
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,920
together really good evidence it just

90
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,640
took a long time for us to

91
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,958
to do that and then that led to um

92
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,760
unnecessary regulatory scrutiny

93
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,560
so story number one of a control issue

94
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,840
um and

95
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,159
we're going to come back to that that

96
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,319
story let's talk about story number two

97
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:59,280
um we're performing a red team exercise

98
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,640
and in particular for some crazy reason

99
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,560
i had agreed to let our internal

100
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,399
auditors run a red team exercise which

101
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,439
is not something i recommend

102
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,080
um i was the they had finished the

103
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,000
exercise

104
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,760
size except for you know one or two

105
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,400
final things they were testing

106
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,359
they had tried getting an externally the

107
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,680
the

108
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,359
sock team caught it responded

109
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,358
appropriately found the phishing site

110
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,880
got it taken down very proactive

111
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,400
everything's looking really good

112
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,479
so we decided to give the red team

113
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,000
access to our network they'll sit on the

114
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,440
network they'll do some things and so

115
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,120
forth we knew they were going to be

116
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,320
successful on the network there was no

117
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,000
question in our mind that they were

118
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,000
going to be successful why because we

119
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
knew we had a vulnerability that was

120
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,600
significant that we were working on

121
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,919
fixing that

122
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,600
would allow a sophisticated attacker

123
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,960
like a red team because we hire smart

124
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,120
people to do this work

125
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,440
um to gain domain admin access in our

126
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,479
environment

127
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,440
now the email that i got when i was on

128
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,758
vacation so i'm

129
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,759
here i am i've flown off to phoenix i'm

130
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,440
enjoying a nice vacation in phoenix

131
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,520
decide to check my email quickly i get

132
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,880
an email from from our head of internal

133
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,280
audit saying hey

134
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,600
you know they managed to to create an

135
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,080
account in the environment

136
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,120
i flipped out the reason i flipped out

137
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,039
was because we knew we had

138
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,000
vulnerabilities we had other controls in

139
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,840
the environment

140
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,520
and one which i assume a lot of people

141
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,479
had but i think is a really good control

142
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,280
to have is we had

143
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,880
an alarm that said if somebody creates

144
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,000
an account in the environment

145
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,840
who is not part of the iam team

146
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,320
sound all sorts of alarm bells and get

147
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,000
people to respond

148
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,840
the alarm bells may have sounded but

149
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,560
nobody was responding

150
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,679
so we had a really well designed well

151
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,759
thought out control

152
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,360
it just wasn't effective in the way that

153
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,240
it was running

154
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,759
um so i'm you know it's like one in the

155
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,120
morning so i check my email like eleven

156
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,360
o'clock and i'm still up at one and one

157
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,759
i'm pacing back and forth forth fuming

158
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,960
in the

159
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:55,520
the the hotel room because

160
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,359
this control should not have failed and

161
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,719
it was a real big problem for us that

162
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,160
failed because it was a really critical

163
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,600
control given the other

164
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,520
issues we had in our environment at the

165
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,600
time so

166
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,359
um you know this is where you know i'd

167
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,560
ask the question what do we mean by

168
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,319
by verifiable effectiveness

169
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,000
so we're going to pull up this now it

170
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,039
should be this one i hope

171
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
um so

172
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,800
you know what i like to compare this to

173
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,840
is

174
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,479
um we all have backups in the

175
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,520
environment we test backups we make sure

176
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,199
they're working

177
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,840
um everything looks you know smooth

178
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,280
and and you know from that perspective

179
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,758
you test the backup you make sure it's

180
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,799
working you do a restore you test that

181
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,639
um but from a security perspective

182
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,919
most of us don't test our controls that

183
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,280
way um so

184
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,639
when i'm talking about verifiable

185
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,318
effectiveness i'm taking this talking

186
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,080
about how we take this same concept

187
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,720
about how we test our backups

188
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,919
and apply it to our security environment

189
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,080
and what we do from a security

190
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,919
perspective

191
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,919
okay so i'm going to talk about this

192
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,560
using the kind of standard triad that

193
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,400
that

194
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,919
people talk about things with i'm going

195
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,120
to talk about from a people process and

196
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,599
a technology perspective i'm actually

197
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,800
going to go

198
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:12,080
go for it um in in reverse order

199
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,199
um so let's talk about technology first

200
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,840
um so if you think about

201
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,360
technology um well let's start this way

202
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,960
when i was in when i started my career

203
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,479
in security i worked in in the higher

204
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,840
education field and the great thing

205
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,960
about higher education is that you have

206
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,479
to think on your feet

207
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,560
um when you're running security in a

208
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,800
higher education environment where the

209
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,680
mission of the the institution is to

210
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,759
enable

211
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,599
sharing of information enable research

212
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,400
enable rapid movement people doing

213
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,840
things that

214
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:43,039
crazy high-speed um technology

215
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,758
can't rely on firewalls so one of the

216
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,159
things that

217
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,879
would happen with some regularity is

218
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,560
some

219
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,639
person around campus who is an i.t

220
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,199
administrator or a professor

221
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,400
or a doctor or whatever um not on the

222
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,039
medical side of the house that's

223
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,878
different

224
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,360
um but they plug the computer into the

225
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,160
network without properly securing it

226
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,240
first

227
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,560
and one of the metrics speaking of the

228
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,840
previous trend we would report the

229
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,520
average lifespan of a machine

230
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,280
that was connected to our network

231
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,440
without being properly secured

232
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,638
and it was generally about 10 minutes so

233
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,199
it would take five minutes after it

234
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,879
would plug

235
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,879
somebody would plug it into the network

236
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,160
before the bad guys compromised it known

237
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,599
it would take us another five minutes to

238
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,120
find out that the bad guys had done and

239
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,719
take it offline

240
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,319
until somebody could do things um to

241
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,400
re-secure re-image and reason care of

242
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,279
the machine um

243
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,838
there are um two main things that we

244
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,279
would

245
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,560
find would happen one people didn't

246
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,679
patch stuff and i'm not going to talk

247
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,518
about patching because i think most

248
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,958
people understand patching and get it

249
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,959
get you know what you need to do to look

250
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,479
at it and then the second thing that

251
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,000
that would come up with regularity is

252
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,680
people didn't configure the machine

253
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,600
properly to be secure

254
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,519
they left the attack surface too broad

255
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,279
et cetera et cetera and back then

256
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,640
um machines that you bought off the

257
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,360
shelf were nowhere near as secure as

258
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,199
they are today

259
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,959
though today there's still obviously

260
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,959
concerns with that

261
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,079
so when i got to the corporate world and

262
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,239
we had actually money to throw out

263
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,160
problems like this

264
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,160
we had a very disciplined approach to

265
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,719
how do we think about um

266
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,680
the configurations associated with

267
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,680
computers

268
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,199
so that we know that those those

269
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,079
machines on the network were

270
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,839
appropriately secured and we could

271
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,560
verify that

272
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,839
so we started um by looking at the

273
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,199
center for internet security and

274
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,920
similar um benchmark based um

275
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,800
basically you know security baselines

276
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,319
and we

277
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,079
customize those for our environment

278
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,040
based on on the need be as minimally as

279
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,480
possible

280
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,000
and we said this is how things need to

281
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,120
be configured we started with two two

282
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,160
things we started with windows we

283
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,160
started with with

284
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,199
the unix environment that we used most

285
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,800
frequently which was

286
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,800
unfortunately aix at the time

287
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,959
we then looked to say how can we

288
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,720
actually tell whether or not systems are

289
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,839
configured to those those standards and

290
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,760
we started with some scripts

291
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,279
scripts have their issues um and then we

292
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,120
finally bought a tool which is designed

293
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,279
to do this and it took a ton of work

294
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,320
because we had to configure you know the

295
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,880
if you look at the center for that

296
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,560
security

297
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,880
list of what you're supposed to do with

298
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,719
uh windows i don't know what we're using

299
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,519
at the time windows 2000

300
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,120
2003 machine it's a long list of

301
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,560
activities that you need to do a long

302
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,120
list of configurations that need to be

303
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,640
set

304
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,720
but we would go through those we look at

305
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,680
those configurations and we would

306
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,320
you know use those to to drive the um

307
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,000
you know

308
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,000
to test and make sure the environment

309
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,839
was secured the way we needed to and

310
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,320
um over the years that list went from

311
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,000
two different platforms to about 50.

312
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,079
some of those platforms were automated

313
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,440
and we were testing generally weekly

314
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,959
because it took a little while for the

315
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,480
the test scans to run

316
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,319
um some were manual and we test them

317
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,399
monthly and in some cases quarterly just

318
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,079
based on the specifics with that

319
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,839
but we would get these reports saying

320
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,760
are the configurations of these machines

321
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,760
configured correctly

322
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,959
straightforward um simple i think a lot

323
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,240
of people think about this problem this

324
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,239
way do these sorts of

325
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,760
activities this way i'm not going to

326
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,959
argue this is cutting edge but it's

327
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,880
important

328
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,800
and it's even more important now as we

329
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,200
all start moving to the cloud

330
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,079
because if you have a windows machine on

331
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,079
your network

332
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,399
and you mess up the permissions from an

333
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,239
smb perspective the odds are you've got

334
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,920
really good other layers of defense in

335
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,320
there that also protect the environment

336
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,079
you have a firewall you have you know

337
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,160
antivirus that can look for malware

338
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,760
coming on in ransomware you have

339
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,439
you know all sorts of other complex

340
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,079
controls out there monitoring and

341
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,200
alerting

342
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,800
controls in the cloud it takes just a

343
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,279
second for somebody to misconfigure an

344
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,959
s3 bucket in your front page news

345
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,399
so when we think about the cloud this

346
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,839
how do we go about configuring our

347
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,040
environment becomes

348
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,440
far far more important and far riskier

349
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,560
so we think about how do we test

350
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,440
security from a

351
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,079
technology perspective think about how

352
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,079
you define

353
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,359
what means good for to be secure what

354
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,120
your standards are

355
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,880
and then figure out how you configure

356
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,399
checks against those and again with the

357
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,560
cloud you want to be thinking about that

358
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,760
being continuous checking so as soon as

359
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,319
somebody changes

360
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,920
a configuration it flags alerts which is

361
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,120
much easier to do in a cloud environment

362
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,479
than it does on an on-premise

363
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,600
environment

364
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,160
um so that's the

365
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,920
um you know that's the the technology

366
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,199
part now let's move in and talk about

367
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,519
processes

368
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,279
um so we go back to the example that i

369
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,680
used earlier with

370
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,800
um you know we had a process out there

371
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,560
that says

372
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,959
um you know when somebody creates an

373
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,199
account we're supposed to do a b and c

374
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,680
you can think about other types of

375
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:33,600
controls in the environment that are

376
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,959
process oriented identity and access

377
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,240
management checks

378
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,800
you know how is it that we are making

379
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,279
sure

380
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,719
that um you know the right people are in

381
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,560
the domain administrators group that

382
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,200
there's no employees in the

383
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,959
in the um the former employees who still

384
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,800
have access to the environment

385
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,000
these are things are executed and driven

386
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,599
through processes rather

387
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,720
than by technology or people

388
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,160
how do you know that every single time a

389
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,880
laptop is built the encryption is

390
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,800
installed

391
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,320
how do you do the reconciliation between

392
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,279
all of the assets that you have in the

393
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,920
environment

394
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,600
all the laptops you own and the

395
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,599
management console to make sure that on

396
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,040
a day over day basis everything is still

397
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,200
encrypted because when i go back to that

398
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,519
example with the stolen laptop

399
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,240
the issue that we actually ran into was

400
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:23,200
not that it wasn't configured properly

401
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,480
when we did the install it was it

402
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,160
encrypted the laptop but the

403
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,959
communications between

404
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,160
the laptop and the management console

405
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,359
broke at some point

406
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,279
and we didn't know because we weren't

407
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,720
doing a reconciliation against it

408
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,160
now even if you have a process that says

409
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,839
we're going to do this reconciliation on

410
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,439
a regular basis to look for these sorts

411
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,199
of things

412
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,120
you still run the risk that that it's

413
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,079
not you know somebody gets busy and they

414
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,760
don't do it that day

415
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,120
that week that month however frequently

416
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,199
you need to do that

417
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,800
um so looking at some of the areas where

418
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,719
where we're seeing control failures

419
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,760
around this we've decided to build a

420
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,639
process

421
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,240
to allow us to understand our critical

422
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,720
controls in our environment

423
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,440
and that what the processes were with

424
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,040
that to

425
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,880
gather and collect evidence to know that

426
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,880
this was working effectively

427
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,880
so what we put in place is what what we

428
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,760
refer to as a do a review or approver

429
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,720
cycle we identified all the controls in

430
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,680
our environment

431
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,880
900 or so controls not all of those were

432
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,359
security controls because we were

433
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,839
actually

434
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,360
also interested in operational controls

435
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,639
and project management controls and

436
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,279
other kind of types of

437
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,680
um controls that didn't have a direct

438
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,720
impact on security so the 900 is was

439
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,399
was a large number and to be clear um we

440
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,519
tried to boil the entire ocean up front

441
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,959
and that was a mistake

442
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,480
we should have taken it a little more

443
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,920
more thoughtfully about where the

444
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,920
critical controls and gain

445
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,760
experience with this but for each one of

446
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,800
the controls whenever somebody who was

447
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,040
responsible for

448
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,880
we identified who owned that control

449
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,199
from an executive perspective who was

450
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,120
the

451
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,519
the control owner from a line manager

452
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,560
perspective and who actually executed on

453
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,480
the control

454
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,638
for us a lot of the executors of

455
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,160
controls were managed service providers

456
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,079
so we had third parties executing on

457
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,279
controls for us

458
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,638
so what we did is we put in this

459
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,279
approach where they would execute the

460
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,440
control

461
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,639
as they go to execute the control they

462
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,399
would document

463
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,600
that that they were executing it along

464
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,720
with the evidence to show that it was

465
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,279
being executed correctly their manager

466
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,440
would then

467
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,439
review the evidence that was being

468
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,920
provided to make sure that

469
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,279
the the data was you know holds up to

470
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,399
what they're saying and if the control

471
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,519
failed if they came and said look you

472
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,360
know we went to do this asset

473
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,399
reconciliation we're missing machines

474
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,720
they could go in and say hey this

475
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,320
control has a failure and then that

476
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,279
alerts people hey we need to pay

477
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,279
attention to this

478
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,279
it might be a one-time failure it's like

479
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,720
you know didn't talk this time

480
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,920
we're gonna you know see if it happens

481
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,600
next time we don't need to really worry

482
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,319
about it or it might be an endemic

483
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,759
failure

484
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,360
that something that happens every single

485
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,600
time in which case that is

486
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,720
indicative to management that an action

487
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,000
needs to be taken to

488
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,880
solve the root cause of the problem to

489
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,639
prevent um issues

490
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,160
so we went through and we did this and

491
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,720
so the viewer does that executes the

492
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,480
control

493
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,759
the reviewer reviews the details and

494
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,199
then there's an approver who has to say

495
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,199
yep i approve that this was done the

496
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,519
intent of the approver is not to go into

497
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,040
the

498
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,199
details on each one of the controls but

499
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,639
just to evidence and and

500
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,639
show that it was done and frankly to

501
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,880
provide some um

502
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,720
accountability to the man to the the

503
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,120
management chain that actually oversees

504
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,959
this

505
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:19,199
and has responsibility for it

506
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,000
so with that do a review or approver

507
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,199
cycle

508
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,839
um we also decided

509
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,959
and this was a bit of overkill but um we

510
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,639
decided that

511
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,319
the evidence that was collected by the

512
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,880
doers should be collected

513
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,320
in ipe format the information provided

514
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,439
by entity because the goal was we should

515
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,360
be able to take this

516
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,199
um information we should be able to use

517
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,639
the same exact data to be able to prove

518
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,319
to the auditors that this is being done

519
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,320
effectively as well

520
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,480
and in fact the idea where we're using a

521
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,160
tool to manage all of this and store all

522
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,000
of this in because when you've got

523
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,519
that many controls you need something

524
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,959
you need some automation behind all of

525
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,240
this need to remind people it's time to

526
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,680
do controls and

527
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,079
and you know hey you've got a control

528
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,560
ready to review but the idea was that we

529
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,399
would just

530
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,079
you know hey auditors come take a look

531
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,440
here's you guys could access the tool go

532
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,399
look at whatever you want

533
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,240
um work so that when the audit cycle

534
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,319
comes on we didn't need to spin up

535
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,079
any extra activity within the

536
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,678
organization to prove things for the

537
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,319
auditor because it was just there it was

538
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,319
just working

539
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:23,039
this was a little overly optimistic um

540
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,959
the the fact of the matter is is that

541
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,039
ipe evidence is hard to gather

542
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,079
um it's not something that every single

543
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,919
person has

544
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,360
innately every single technologist has

545
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,080
innately in their makeup to know how to

546
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
do that

547
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,039
um and again we were trying to boil

548
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,439
those oceans we had way too many

549
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:40,400
controls but the concept

550
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,760
is very powerful having that if you say

551
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,120
that there's no even if you start with

552
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,200
the 10 controls and you're doing this

553
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,959
with spreadsheets and email

554
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,880
that are most important you know those

555
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,400
controls are working effectively

556
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,400
before something bad happens

557
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,679
so let's talk briefly now about the

558
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,520
people side of the house

559
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,120
because the fact of the matter is people

560
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,960
make mistakes there are some things that

561
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,120
are not process oriented

562
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,240
um the process may execute effectively

563
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,000
but doesn't mean that people are

564
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,559
analyzing interpreting things

565
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,160
um appropriately so let's go back to my

566
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,960
my ruined vacation

567
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,320
um you know how could we have known that

568
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,320
there was a failure with this control

569
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,520
before the red team and to be clear like

570
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,120
even having the red team

571
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,320
was better than um having the bad guys

572
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,199
tell us about it

573
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,240
but so taking that nugget what we said

574
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,320
what can we do

575
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,919
to emulate this type of thing more

576
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,720
frequently we don't want to wait for a

577
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,480
red team

578
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,320
so i went to someone on my team and i

579
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,000
said you know what go do this

580
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,600
who was not part of the sock i said go

581
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,360
do this every week just

582
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,120
do it every week and let me know let's

583
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,678
make sure that that it's being

584
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,840
you know handled correctly this

585
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,200
developed the point where we decided

586
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,879
it's not the only control we should be

587
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,760
doing every week we should every week we

588
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,320
should run

589
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,240
a certain number of attacks um we were

590
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,918
starting at like five or six but the

591
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,520
service provider that was managing our

592
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,799
sock is like if you do five or six the

593
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,080
metrics aren't good enough because

594
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,400
there's not enough evidence

595
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,159
so we ended up bumping it to 40 50 tests

596
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,840
a week and it was really simple we did

597
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,559
that we did the test and we evaluated

598
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,360
two things

599
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:13,760
did the stock detected appropriately and

600
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,360
was it responded to appropriately

601
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,799
did they take all of the right steps

602
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,479
they're supposed to take

603
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,000
um to contain the incident in an

604
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,120
appropriate time frame so if somebody

605
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,640
created an account

606
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,320
um if they noticed the account was

607
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,440
created that's that means they detected

608
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,360
it correctly but

609
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,320
unless they were following the process

610
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,479
and going in

611
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,360
locking slash deleting the the account

612
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,880
that was created

613
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,719
without approval and locking and

614
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,720
deleting the account that was

615
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,240
um that created it and then figuring out

616
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,760
whether or not that comp account was

617
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,559
compromised in the first place they

618
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,799
failed the

619
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,799
was it responded to correctly high bar

620
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,918
for responding correct

621
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:52,799
um so that actually was was

622
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,080
was um an effective approach in fact the

623
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,160
point where we were looking at how do we

624
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,639
make this a contractual

625
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,600
measure that we use with our service

626
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,480
provider

627
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,760
so that their if they weren't detecting

628
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,240
and responding

629
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,280
appropriately they were paying penalties

630
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,440
to us and

631
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,120
you know not getting the full um the

632
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,559
full value of what they

633
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,479
you know had put into things um

634
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,760
so let me stop the presentation because

635
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,480
i think that's all i

636
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,480
had on the

637
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,760
okay um so so if we step back and we

638
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,240
look at this

639
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,400
now there's a process and procedure that

640
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,760
we now have put in place it says are we

641
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,120
are we looking at the technology are we

642
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,080
confident that the technology is being

643
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,600
handled correctly

644
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,879
are we looking at the processes do we

645
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,439
know the processes are being executed

646
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,960
correctly

647
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,799
and do we have people who are doing

648
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,559
smart and good things

649
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,158
and all of this allows us to be in a

650
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,039
situation where we step back and we say

651
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,640
the odds

652
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,760
there's still the chance the bad guys

653
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,200
are going to find something we never

654
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,280
thought of that wasn't covered on

655
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,640
it um and they're going to get into the

656
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,399
environment you know welcome to

657
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,760
information security this bad guys are

658
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,120
really smart and there's a lot of them

659
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,559
and they work well together

660
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,000
they come from all sorts of backgrounds

661
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,200
and perspectives they think of all sorts

662
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,799
of things we're never going to think of

663
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,159
the bad guys if they're smart they'll

664
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,799
get in

665
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,440
however we now have confidence in a

666
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,559
couple things

667
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,679
one um if they do get in likely they're

668
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,120
doing something that's relatively

669
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,559
sophisticated because we trust our

670
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,760
program but

671
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,879
two that we can know that if something

672
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,480
bad happens

673
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,159
and it hits the press from a

674
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,159
reputational standpoint

675
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,200
the bottom line message is not going to

676
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,880
be boy

677
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,640
they're messing up the basics you know

678
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,240
boy laptop wasn't even encrypted you

679
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,039
know how how could that possibly have

680
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,880
happened

681
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,480
it was going to be something complex

682
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,080
that they messed up

683
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,840
um it was going to be something you know

684
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,199
the the team is on top of

685
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:46,639
on top of things so i think from a

686
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,960
macro level perspective that um

687
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,320
provides a lot of a lot more confidence

688
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,080
in the quality of the controls that

689
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,080
approach the controls

690
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,678
um you know we aren't going to delude

691
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,120
ourselves and go out and say hey our

692
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,240
controls are bulletproof and the fact of

693
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,678
the matter is the controls weren't

694
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,400
bulletproof i mean every single time

695
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,919
that we

696
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,039
looked at the technology we would find

697
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,760
things that weren't configured as

698
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,760
standards

699
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,120
that needed to be updated that needed to

700
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,960
be fixed and sometimes those were

701
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,959
long-term fixes because it required

702
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,720
application development work

703
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,480
sometimes re-engineering of applications

704
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,000
is expensive but at least we knew

705
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,480
and we could track exceptions against

706
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,720
that you know and know what the progress

707
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,120
was to make things better

708
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,720
from a process perspective we had tons

709
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,280
of failures controls that failed all the

710
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,000
time

711
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,440
but we knew about them we could take

712
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,760
that we could use it as input to

713
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,679
prioritize the activities to improve the

714
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,039
quality of the controls

715
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,679
and sit there and say you know these

716
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:39,120
controls table stakes the laptops need

717
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,400
to be encrypted we need to build

718
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,158
evidence that

719
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,919
versus some of the other controls that

720
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,000
if they failed we felt comfortable we

721
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,720
had other things in place to protect the

722
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,520
impacts and the risks from it the people

723
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,039
side it's

724
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,400
you know smart people are always going

725
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,158
to be able to break into the environment

726
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,919
but we now have not only created a way

727
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,280
to test our ourselves so that we're not

728
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,000
deleting ourselves

729
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,879
we have created a continuous feedback

730
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,520
cycle

731
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,480
that allows us to be better at what

732
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,559
we're doing

733
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,320
by understanding how the bad guys get in

734
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,320
we looked at the the

735
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,000
um we looked at the results of these

736
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,720
kind of mini red team exercises that we

737
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,120
were running on a weekly basis

738
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,919
we ran them against the kill shane and

739
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,158
the the

740
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,919
you know mitre attack framework and we

741
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,919
said you know what are the ways that we

742
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,559
can improve our controls to so you know

743
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,520
not just

744
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,960
uh to better detect and respond but when

745
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,320
we look at these types of attacks what

746
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,159
can we do better

747
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,600
so and and how can we detect these

748
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,440
things better what steps should we have

749
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,799
taken if we saw a to look

750
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,520
back and see how they might have gotten

751
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:42,000
into the environment so the the sock

752
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,039
got improved over time because they were

753
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,440
doing this

754
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,720
also improved inconsistency and i will

755
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,200
tell you that you know

756
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,159
going into to this i felt good about our

757
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,240
sock i thought

758
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,919
it was you know doing a really good job

759
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,520
catching things really well

760
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,720
but it wasn't until we started testing

761
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,720
it and testing it regularly that we

762
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,039
started understanding the deficiencies

763
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,840
and the areas where things went down but

764
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,520
we learned

765
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,959
we got better because we were doing that

766
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,879
on a regular basis to be able to

767
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,000
understand what was going on

768
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,159
um and you know it took a while to build

769
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,720
up you know the quality good controls to

770
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,400
be

771
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,200
what it is that we needed and how we

772
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,919
needed to think about things

773
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,919
and the the outcomes you know spoke for

774
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,520
themselves

775
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,760
it did take a lot of investment it took

776
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:28,000
a lot of time some of these things were

777
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,879
um you know the technology stuff

778
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,080
probably

779
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:35,600
ten years to mature to where we

780
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:38,879
really wanted it to be um the

781
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,158
process stuff um when i left the company

782
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,200
we're at where we put this in place we

783
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,880
were probably

784
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,799
two three years in and it probably

785
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,440
hadn't probably two years in we probably

786
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,360
had another

787
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,640
two to three before it was firing on all

788
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,918
cylinders but it was a good

789
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,240
process and moving in the right

790
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,000
direction a lot of education and

791
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,600
training to do with that

792
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,360
um and the people side i mean

793
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,080
instantaneous results instantaneous

794
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,479
improvement

795
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,320
um and you know i'm a big believer of

796
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,080
the importance of of detection and

797
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,678
response capabilities and i'm also a big

798
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,039
believer that there is no

799
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,720
you know you can never be perfect at

800
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,158
that so you're always wanting to look at

801
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,000
continuous improvement you're always

802
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,799
trying to look at those sorts of things

803
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,159
so i felt coming out of this that it was

804
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,200
you know really good that we would

805
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,799
understand

806
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,039
if something bad happened that it was

807
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:24,000
going to happen our backups were tested

808
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,000
the security backups

809
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,600
if a bad guy was going to get in the

810
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,000
environment the odds were that either

811
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,559
we'd know

812
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,320
really quickly or um it would be some

813
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,399
way that was novel and unique that

814
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,799
that um you know but it wasn't going to

815
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,640
be a failure on our part

816
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,158
so i i think if i can figure out how to

817
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,320
do it now um let's

818
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,919
turn over q a hopefully there's some

819
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,720
some good questions

820
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,720
um out there i don't see any in the the

821
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,360
system but

822
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,880
people to ask questions i don't i don't

823
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,678
see any now but this is a great time

824
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,919
please

825
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,600
ask larry some questions um great

826
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,880
presentation larry

827
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,959
yeah i mean i like us to be as

828
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,720
interactive as is as humanly possible in

829
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,720
this strange world that we live in now

830
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,400
and if i put everyone to sleep then i

831
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:13,279
put everyone to sleep but i'm hoping

832
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,360
that's not the case

833
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:17,279
still pretty early in the day let me

834
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,320
check over here uh

835
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:22,880
we don't have anyone in track one

836
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,080
oh there's yeah hey jake thank you for

837
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,279
the question really appreciate

838
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,120
um that so the question is why don't

839
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,960
why don't i think that more people use

840
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,719
red teams um

841
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,320
there are a couple things that that i

842
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,200
find um

843
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,120
one is uh paranoia and fear i think

844
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,520
there's a lot of people who are afraid

845
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,678
to um afraid of the results you're going

846
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,080
to get from the red team

847
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,039
the and they are i mean i'll be really

848
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,279
clear like

849
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,600
you see a good red team result you look

850
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:54,880
at you think oh my god we are messed up

851
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:57,439
um they're gonna get in and and

852
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,240
you know i've i've been in the situation

853
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,400
um

854
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,840
you know and and we would do red teams a

855
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,360
couple times a year in addition to the

856
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,559
weekly red teaming that we did we would

857
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,719
do kind of formal

858
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,000
no holds barred red teaming a couple

859
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,159
times a year

860
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,840
and the thing that i think is most

861
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,120
important about red teams

862
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,879
well two things i think are really

863
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,239
important about it um because i like

864
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,799
stories as i said i'm going to start

865
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,399
with

866
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:22,320
um a example we we were

867
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,600
um when we were first thinking we were

868
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,799
going to do a red team we started we

869
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,240
were going through the contracting

870
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,840
process and then the internal audit

871
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,120
people did a red team

872
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:34,639
without telling us we came

873
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,760
this close to getting a contractor fired

874
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,559
from their company

875
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,320
because we saw the red team we saw the

876
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,039
activity we didn't know it was a red

877
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,879
team

878
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,240
we did enough investigation to see

879
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,760
somebody with the user id was doing

880
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,600
something they weren't supposed to

881
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,200
and we were in the process of escalating

882
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,120
that to the company

883
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,799
when the internal auditor said oh yeah

884
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,239
that was us we were doing red team we

885
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:57,120
broke into that account

886
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,480
so rule number one of red teaming to to

887
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,719
make it more palatable

888
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,399
is that someone in the instant

889
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,960
escalation path

890
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,158
needs to be aware that the red team is

891
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,679
going on

892
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,360
before you would get point to the point

893
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:13,039
you would be taking action against

894
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:15,360
individuals and other things like that

895
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,080
the second thing on that is that you

896
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,559
need to have

897
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,960
the right level of visibility so that if

898
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:22,879
it does cause a problem in production

899
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,640
that you can respond appropriately i

900
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,320
think people are really scared about

901
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,840
what happens in production and they're

902
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,080
going to cause a

903
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,840
operational outage with a lot of um

904
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,960
impact i think communicating about that

905
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,879
in advance

906
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,960
and you know i mean generally you don't

907
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,440
ask red teams to do denial service type

908
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,840
attacks

909
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,440
unless you're in a very specific uh type

910
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,360
of uh situation where that

911
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,279
you expect to be hardened against that

912
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,240
to the nth degree but you do want to

913
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,200
make sure they're not

914
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,480
causing problems um we had one where

915
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,919
they got into a machine

916
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:56,720
and um the team was about to take down

917
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,240
production so i called one of the the

918
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,039
folks on my team is look we were doing a

919
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,200
red team

920
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,480
who was on the stock it said okay well

921
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,520
this is fully redundant so i'm not going

922
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,640
to tell anyone else we're going to take

923
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,600
the machine down because it's the right

924
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,000
thing to do

925
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,760
um i do know one company that did a red

926
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,799
team where the only people who knew

927
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,640
was the cso and the general counsel and

928
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,240
they kept the red team going

929
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,000
up until the point they were going to do

930
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,240
notifications so they red team the

931
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,600
entire breach response process

932
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,679
up into the point where somebody's going

933
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,480
to hit send on the on communications to

934
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,279
customers

935
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,320
i think it's a little gutsy um the other

936
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,799
thing that i'd say

937
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,918
is that and this is maybe the biggest

938
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:35,840
issue in

939
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:38,159
a large degree is that it's hard to

940
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,080
if you're not used to red teams to

941
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,520
communicate the results of the red team

942
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,678
exercises

943
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:47,360
and what i mean by that is um

944
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,880
the results are going to be put into a

945
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,120
report which are going to be handed to

946
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,440
someone who is not a security person

947
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,120
who's not as cognizant of these sorts of

948
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,360
things and is going to say

949
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,559
oh my god what the hell are you doing

950
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,840
you know security people you've been

951
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,399
asleep at the wheel that should never

952
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,918
happen they should never have gotten in

953
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:07,360
um what i did and this is the the

954
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,559
conversation that i would have with our

955
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,678
board with our ceo

956
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:12,799
with with other executives was made the

957
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,039
point really clearly

958
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,840
that if we if the red team is not

959
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,679
successful

960
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,600
the only thing that it tells us is we

961
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,440
hired the wrong red team

962
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,158
because the intent behind the red team

963
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,919
is not to test the simple and easy stuff

964
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,440
the intent behind the red team is to

965
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,000
test the boundaries to make sure we're

966
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,360
able to

967
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,880
react to things at the extremes now it's

968
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,320
different if you do a red team exercise

969
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,360
and the results come back and it's

970
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,158
really clear that you don't know what

971
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,000
you're doing

972
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,360
um you know if it's like oh yeah we

973
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,640
tried something really basic and

974
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,760
and no one even noticed um but

975
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,760
again the goal is improvement over time

976
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,200
it's not to keep them out is to learn

977
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,039
what the bad guys do and make sure your

978
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,159
program is responsive to that and not

979
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:55,919
responsive to

980
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:57,919
theoretical uh playbook type issues

981
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,880
hopefully that that covered the question

982
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,880
other questions out there

983
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,200
um i see a question over in our discord

984
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,000
channel

985
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,799
yes we have a track one discord there so

986
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,399
it says i've

987
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,240
i've heard people say i don't want to

988
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,760
run a red team

989
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,519
because i don't think i have resources

990
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,440
to fix the findings

991
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,120
and i don't want to sit on them so we

992
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,440
will do it later have you come across

993
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,039
this

994
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,360
how do you convince someone that they're

995
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,360
ready

996
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,200
um i i can't recall ever running a red

997
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,678
team

998
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,399
um quickly for the first couple times in

999
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:35,919
a position and feeling like i'm ready

1000
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:37,120
um so um you know because you don't know

1001
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,159
what you don't know until you

1002
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:43,279
until you try um i do think that

1003
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:46,799
it is common to be afraid of the results

1004
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:48,399
and um you know i when i when i was

1005
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,200
talking about that that red team earlier

1006
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,799
on where i said there was a

1007
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,559
vulnerability in the environment

1008
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:56,720
that um that was going to be

1009
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,600
um that was so significant that we knew

1010
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,720
they were going to be able to get to

1011
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,158

1012
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,000
um that issue was one that

1013
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,320
had come out of a prior red team

1014
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,519
exercise and we were in the pro

1015
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:14,320
process of fixing and it was

1016
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:16,559
a um two million dollar fix that was

1017
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,039
going to take 18 months of coding

1018
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,559
in a high risk environment that was

1019
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,799
critical to the business

1020
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,799
um you know it was a risky code change

1021
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,320
like i mean it was

1022
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,480
lack of clarity as to whether or not it

1023
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,240
was going to be supportable so when that

1024
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,640
finding came out

1025
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,240
um and it wasn't it wasn't a surprise to

1026
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,200
anyone on the security team

1027
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,159
i mean we we knew that the exposure was

1028
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,279
there

1029
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,679
um but when the finding came out it led

1030
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:46,960
to an interesting set of conversations

1031
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,720
um and it really helped us get the

1032
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,000
funding that we needed and

1033
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,360
not even the funding the wherewithal to

1034
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,720
find out the right solution to the

1035
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:56,959
problem and then the funding

1036
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,799
to address it um because

1037
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,159
what a it was a red team result people

1038
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,120
were really clear that attack is not

1039
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,519
theoretical

1040
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,199
it's significant um and we had the right

1041
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,640
visibility around the results that

1042
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,039
people very high up were getting

1043
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,000
nervous about it being out there um it

1044
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,158
wasn't pleasant

1045
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,600
i mean here i am now running this you

1046
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,679
know large project that's got a whole

1047
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,439
bunch of developers external people and

1048
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,279
we were you know any delay everyone's

1049
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,279
panicked about um because

1050
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,799
the exposure was high but it was the

1051
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:25,679
right thing to do

1052
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:27,440
um so red teams and in more so than pen

1053
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,120
tests and more so than

1054
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,880
even i think kind of maturity

1055
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,320
assessments and this self-assessments

1056
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,440
and stuff like that

1057
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,439
um do a good job at helping garner the

1058
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,600
executive attention to drive

1059
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,960
the funding that's necessary to scale

1060
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,959
out and fix issues

1061
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:49,519
however um i think it's good that

1062
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:52,719
before running a red team to have that

1063
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,240
as an eyes wide open conversation with

1064
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,279
the management chain like look we need

1065
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,480
to do this it's the right thing to do

1066
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,919
we're going to learn really interesting

1067
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,880
things from doing it

1068
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,480
but we really don't know what we're

1069
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,240
going to need to do to fix the issues

1070
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,200
until we see the issues

1071
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,800
and we may need money to do that um but

1072
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,320
you know it's not a reason to

1073
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,919
ignorance is never good from a security

1074
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,919
program perspective

1075
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,918
all right any other questions

1076
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,440
well i don't see any right now so i want

1077
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:23,199
to thank you i got one more

1078
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,800
today hey john i got one more that just

1079
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,520
came through so with the red teams i i

1080
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,200
work with

1081
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,399
what makes successful red team and what

1082
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,839
makes a terrible red team from the

1083
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:33,279
business side if you work with more

1084
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:35,279
than one red team org um like i

1085
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,399
love changing red team organizations and

1086
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,280
partly because

1087
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,799
different people have different

1088
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,960
perspectives but also different skill

1089
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,480
sets so we we ran one where people

1090
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,720
were where we asked them to steal money

1091
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,520
from us so they needed to have a

1092
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,319
combined

1093
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,040
team of technical hackers and people who

1094
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,919
understand

1095
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,320
finance systems at large enterprises um

1096
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,520
so

1097
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,879
you know that was very specialized

1098
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,440
knowledge we found a company that did

1099
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,279
that

1100
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,720
um cloud red teams require a different

1101
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:02,240
set of skill sets

1102
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,160
um you know i think that the

1103
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,759
finding people who do this for a living

1104
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,040
really know how to do it is what makes

1105
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,240
it successful

1106
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:12,400
um i could spend another four hours

1107
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,160
probably talking about

1108
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,079
the reports that you get from from red

1109
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,000
teams and pen tests and so forth i think

1110
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,920
that's the biggest flaw

1111
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,119
um the area that makes really terrible

1112
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,960
red team is is that they

1113
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,040
they write things in a way that is not

1114
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,480
helpful at prioritizing and driving

1115
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,079
results so i i know we're up on time but

1116
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,880
i appreciate everyone i appreciate
