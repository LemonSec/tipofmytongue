okay hey thanks a lot everybody um so

22
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,039
yeah burning technical debt it's

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,400
something that we all have

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,280
and um i get asked about it quite a bit

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,400
because it's it's a

26
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,320
it's a big focus of mine i will

27
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,920
jump right in and hopefully we'll get

28
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,439
some questions at the end

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,360
um i am as john said cso of paxos trust

30
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,798
where

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,840
we have something to do with blockchain

32
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,759
um actually we

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,600
empower large financial organizations by

34
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,079
providing blockchain infrastructure to

35
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,360
do

36
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:35,039
really cool things and we also have a um

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,799
a couple of the biggest stable coins out

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,000
there tied to gold

39
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,240
and uh us dollars right before

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,680
paxos i was at the nypd where i was the

41
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,320
director of cyber intelligence

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,280
and uh investigations and i also was a

43
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,479
detective in

44
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,640
the middle of the police department in

45
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,079
texas i was also a um

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,360
i had a startup in texas um for

47
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,360
for about five years and uh that that

48
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,399
fed some of my knowledge about tech debt

49
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,719
um

50
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,399
from you know the hard way uh but i also

51
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,158
spent about ten years doing

52
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,080
uh incident response so you know if you

53
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,720
saw me something terrible had just

54
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,560
happened

55
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,359
uh and prior to that in 2005 i

56
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,160
established the security practice at 451

57
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,120
research or

58
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,400
451 group which is now 451 research um

59
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,280
my son and i were talking last night

60
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,920
about

61
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,360
tech debt and he was we were sort of

62
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,920
going back and forth about whether this

63
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,520
is a

64
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,599
digital phenomenon whether this is a

65
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,520
phenomenon of the the new

66
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,200
you know cloud world and no it's it's

67
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,800
actually a human phenomenon

68
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,000
and uh we were talking and he just

69
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
immediately said oh yeah the great

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,800
escape

71
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,480
is is really a good example of that and

72
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,959
we both read the book and seen the movie

73
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,160
and

74
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,840
um while they're different there's

75
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,359
there's a few things that actually are

76
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,200
are the same and he's absolutely right

77
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,040
it's a perfect example of technical debt

78
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,359
and the reason i say that

79
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,079
um you know you probably know that the

80
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,480
basic story

81
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,840
which is a an officer a prisoner camp in

82
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,119
world war ii and there were current

83
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,360
canadians americans

84
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,159
brits and australians uh they were all

85
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,440
officers

86
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,239
mostly aviators they really wanted to

87
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,000
innovate in

88
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,760
in how they did escapes and they wanted

89
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,560
to come up with a new product

90
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,760
to get more people out than ever the

91
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,200
most important thing that they wanted to

92
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,319
do was not actually get the people out

93
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,679
but they wanted to

94
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,159
make the germans use too much of their

95
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,120
resources um burn up all their resources

96
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,599
at home so that

97
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,200
uh their comrades and arms could could

98
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,959
launch uh successful attacks

99
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,798
and the way they thought about this was

100
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,599
they said let's let's build a lot of

101
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,159
tunnels

102
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,839
in a place that the germans put us with

103
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,280
sandy soil so that we couldn't tunnel at

104
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,239
all and boy will that be innovative and

105
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,480
surprising

106
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,920
and so they they began work on three

107
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,959
simultaneous tunnels they called tom

108
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,399
dick and harry there was actually a

109
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,440
fourth called george that they didn't

110
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,720
they didn't end up doing but um

111
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,440
they pushed really hard to get all the

112
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,720
features and the the features were that

113
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,680
you know you had to be able to fit a man

114
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,519
but they had to make some

115
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,280
they had to make a bunch of compromises

116
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,200
as they went they had to make them

117
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,640
uh less deep than they than they wanted

118
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,159
they had to show them up less

119
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,559
less than they wanted and they had to

120
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,840
make them thinner and um

121
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,760
there were more choke points than they

122
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,959
wanted and so they they suffered from

123
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,760
collapse as they suffered from them

124
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,519
getting stuck in

125
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,439
the narrow tunnel and and a bunch of

126
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,040
other challenges but in the end

127
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,760
77 of the expected 250 people managed to

128
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,239
get through

129
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,040
76 actually escaped the 77th actually

130
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,040
surrendered

131
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,159
um there were 600 people who worked on

132
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,959
the thing

133
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,160
so what i'm saying is is that by shoring

134
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,280
up the infrastructure

135
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,520
even when you have not great

136
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,719
infrastructure you can make things work

137
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,159
if there is technical debt

138
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,919
it's just that they don't work as well

139
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,440
and that they don't work as safely

140
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,960
um if you take a look at some of some of

141
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,479
the stuff that they did to

142
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,000
shore up their infrastructure i mean

143
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,840
they stole everything and that was

144
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,960
actually part of the downfall part of

145
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,159
the ways that they got caught a couple

146
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,758
of times was they were just taking

147
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,680
everything to try to get the

148
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,360
infrastructure to work starting off as

149
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,600
small as they could but building up as

150
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,160
they needed to

151
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,880
so to define tech deck i'm just going to

152
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,400
say that it

153
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,159
is and we're all guilty of this i was

154
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,039
guilty of this as a ceo i

155
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,240
you know i want to make a product and

156
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,600
the first thing i want to do is get it

157
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,520
in customer hands so i need something

158
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,880
that's as close to mvp as possible and

159
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,400
so i just want to get there as fast as i

160
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,440
can and damn the torpedoes full speed

161
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,719
ahead let's just go

162
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,800
and get those features done so we're

163
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,800
going to accept things for now

164
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,080
we're going to accept things or ignore

165
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,080
things and

166
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,479
that is the infrastructural and

167
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,479
configuration or or information security

168
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,479
work that we delay

169
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,758
to let us focus on what we think is

170
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,599
important right to

171
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,960
to get the thing that we're building in

172
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,880
the hands of the people

173
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,159
we want to use it so that we can bring

174
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,360
in money so

175
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,639
our revenue teams are our business

176
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,840
people they're telling us what the

177
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,639
customers want

178
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,320
um and we're just moving ahead as fast

179
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,919
as we can

180
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,360
if you've spent any time in information

181
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,039
security or in

182
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,240
in information technology you know that

183
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,440
nothing is more permanent than a

184
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,479
temporary fix

185
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:52,080
um and so a lot of these fixes that

186
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:55,120
a lot of these things that we accept

187
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,840
accumulate and you end up with this huge

188
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,840
backlog

189
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,599
of accumulation of technical debt and

190
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,758
this is aggravated by

191
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,880
the fact and it's just a fact that no

192
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,759
matter how much you love our employees

193
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,360
no matter how much we love our

194
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,960
co-workers people leave people move on

195
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,440
to different things people get fired

196
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,039
uh people get sick and we try to do

197
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,680
knowledge transfer we try to share the

198
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,159
information

199
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,280
that we that we have and no but we're

200
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,479
when i'm doing that

201
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,919
if i'm a developer or if i'm an

202
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,199
application guy or i'm a business guy

203
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,000
i'm talking about the stuff that works

204
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,800
i'm talking about the stuff

205
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,440
that i think is important and a lot of

206
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,199
the

207
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,199
compromises that i might have made along

208
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,560
the way don't get knowledge transferred

209
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,400
so it's very

210
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,840
very common and i would say this all the

211
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,000
time in incident response

212
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,359
that you know i'm dealing with a team

213
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,840
who inherited

214
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,800
uh a group of a bunch of technology from

215
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,638
a team

216
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,000
who's no longer there and they inherited

217
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,520
it from a team was no longer there and

218
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,080
they inherited from teams so you've

219
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,440
actually got

220
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,520
no built-in cultural institutional

221
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,080
knowledge of how your technology got

222
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,400
there

223
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,080
and so people start to just assume

224
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,880
things about the bedrock on which

225
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,120
they're working

226
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,080
and if you don't stir it up and if you

227
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,720
don't look

228
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,359
to see whether those those assumptions

229
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,080
are true

230
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,360
you can get into some real trouble

231
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,120
developers

232
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,120
too and you'd think that developers are

233
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,960
in the best position to

234
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,120
uh to see these things and you know in

235
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,680
some ways they are but the problem is

236
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,280
developers sort of they like to see the

237
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,000
the things that are working and make

238
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,159
them better

239
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,840
um and they're not really interested in

240
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,199
the things that they haven't that they

241
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,638
don't need to worry about because

242
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,319
developers are constantly trying to push

243
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,680
forward they're very creative people

244
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,039
and they want to move forward and it's

245
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,560
it's completely understandable that

246
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,599
that's how they go so like if i think

247
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,680
about

248
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,800
you know and i've said this before in

249
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,440
different places but

250
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,319
you know developers business they're a

251
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,080
lot like

252
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,199
the the traffic cops they just want to

253
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,560
keep things going let's just get

254
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,160
everything going move as fast as you

255
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,720
possibly can let's just get where we're

256
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,280
going

257
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,120
and everything will be okay and security

258
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,080
people are much more like homicide

259
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,199
investigators

260
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,919
whoa let's just slow down and let me

261
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,360
just ask

262
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:59,280
a few questions now there's a natural

263
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,879
tension that gets built between these

264
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,799
two groups and that's great

265
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,240
that that should be there the the

266
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,039
problem is when one group is too

267
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,800
powerful

268
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,719
uh and and usually one group is too

269
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,000
powerful because senior executives are

270
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,000
not recognizing

271
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,599
that you need that balance you need to

272
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,800
be able to have

273
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,878
really good and cordial and

274
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,240
collaborative relationships across both

275
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,360
groups so you don't want the security

276
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,319
guy having too much

277
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,960
input to the extent that they are dr

278
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,240
know

279
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,159
that you know security is where

280
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,520
everything goes to die and they never

281
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,560
want to do anything and they're just no

282
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,159
fun at all

283
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,440
because as soon as you get into that

284
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,680
what will end up happening is your

285
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,679
product

286
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,519
um they'll just start to go around you

287
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,958
and they'll just you'll end up with not

288
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,479
not just technical debt but you'll also

289
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,919
end up with shadow i.t you'll end up

290
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,800
with a whole bunch of other things

291
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,360
that are part and parcel of security

292
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,240
having too much influence or security

293
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,440
uh workers who don't understand what is

294
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,640
trying to be created they don't

295
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,000
understand the business and i know we

296
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,199
always say you know hey we're security

297
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,120
we should we should understand the

298
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,240
business but a lot of us don't

299
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,640
we're just focused on what you can't do

300
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,480
um if you go the other way then the

301
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,839
security guy gets kind of left out

302
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,200
the developers are running the show and

303
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,640
the security guy's just yelling until

304
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,000
he's blue in the face

305
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,760
and if you've got a security person with

306
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,959
integrity they're going to leave and

307
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,200
and you're going to keep going through

308
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,160
people uh until you find somebody who

309
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
isn't going to leave and then you're

310
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,480
just going to have somebody who's

311
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,440
basically powerless

312
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,560
and that's not good either so finding

313
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,399
that good balance between

314
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,239
developers business and security is

315
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,040
really important that's got to come from

316
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,440
the top down

317
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,839
it can't be um it can't be something

318
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,120
that is imposed by just the security guy

319
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,320
or mid-level management

320
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,640
um excuse me bottom-up and top down or

321
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,399
it fails ceo has to put his arm around

322
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,720
the security guy and say yes this is

323
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,040
this is what we're doing

324
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,399
i heard this this morning we were

325
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,880
watching a

326
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,000
video interview of this uh he's a guy

327
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,519
who makes tools by hand

328
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,760
and everything and he had on carolyn

329
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,640
baker who writes a bunch of books and

330
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,160
and this

331
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,800
quote about the death of uncertainty and

332
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,959
the trauma in a torrent of trauma

333
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,000
uh something that she was talking about

334
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,079
uh

335
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,200
the pandemic we all felt this when this

336
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,239
happened and and

337
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,640
i know that with technical debt

338
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,160
that can happen too so when you've

339
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,600
accumulated technical debt and you might

340
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,120
not even notice it and everything seems

341
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,360
like it's just humming along and you're

342
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,399
all

343
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,240
you know everything's right down the

344
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,839
middle and all of a sudden you crash

345
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,640
into a tree

346
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,240
that phrase is perfect for the dynamic

347
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,839
that happens in companies because people

348
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,600
just get they really get stunned and

349
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,880
they don't quite know where to go

350
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,160
and they and they have to go back and

351
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,439
start questioning things they've never

352
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,439
actually questioned

353
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,800
everything that they've counted on you

354
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,000
know it's kind of like if your water

355
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,599
gets turned off in your house it's

356
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,720
really a surprise and i don't know if

357
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,720
it's just happened to you but when it

358
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,519
does it's really a shock or the internet

359
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,560
goes out

360
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,440
this stuff has all shifted that is the

361
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,239
moment

362
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,560
where it's really a you know come to

363
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,800
your

364
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,640
your day to hear moment where you

365
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,640
suddenly are

366
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,240
really rethinking everything about the

367
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,920
decisions that you've made and i think

368
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,880
it's pretty clear that you know we're on

369
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,079
zoom right now

370
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:05,519
we don't um we've seen that zoom

371
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,800
like many many companies um

372
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,640
had a product that they wanted to get

373
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,959
out and what they wanted to do was end

374
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,560
the horror and pain of webex they wanted

375
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,199
to end the horror and pain of other

376
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,680
video

377
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,959
video stuff is terrible i love zoom i

378
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,599
was just talking to my friend ian who i

379
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,279
mentioned later

380
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,880
and he was like i look better on zoom i

381
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,839
sound better on zoom right zoom is

382
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,320
awesome

383
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,200
but they were so interested in getting

384
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,000
all their stuff

385
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,200
out there that they forgot about this

386
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,120
basic

387
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,560
this bedrock this this foundational

388
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,880
stuff and

389
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,160
it cost them dearly as soon as it became

390
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,079
it went from

391
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,760
something that was nice to have to an

392
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,040
absolutely essential resource

393
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,079
and that's when all the security people

394
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,040
started playing with it that's when all

395
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,479
the criminals started playing with it

396
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,920
and suddenly it comes out that there's a

397
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,680
lot of stuff shifting the ground has

398
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,199
shifted underneath zoom's feet

399
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,120
and you know i'll talk about a little

400
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,560
bit about that later

401
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,120
so if i think about a technical debt

402
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,560
life cycle um you have a company that's

403
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,680
got a great idea this is going to be

404
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,680
awesome we're going to get into the

405
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,199
hands of the customers and so you get

406
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,519
something out there that's basically you

407
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,200
know

408
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,800
mvp or something and then there's a

409
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,360
reaction and the customers always say

410
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,479
the same thing

411
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,200
well you know this is pretty good you

412
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,519
know i like it um i get to do a few more

413
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,880
things and when they say that

414
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,920
of course the business is like oh of

415
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,120
course we're going to do a few more

416
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,240
things you know that's absolutely what

417
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,079
we're going to do and so

418
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,440
we start to make more and more of those

419
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,560
compromises because they by the way they

420
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,680
still haven't paid us right they're just

421
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,880
we're just trying to get this in the

422
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,479
hands so that they'll say it's great so

423
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,079
that we can go to our other people

424
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,760
and so like our business people like

425
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,638
this is awesome keep going keep pushing

426
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,519
keep pushing

427
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,279
and then you eventually and absolutely

428
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,320
without fail you'd get to a crash

429
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:39,120
and wow we we just never thought that

430
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,560
so you know that's that's the definition

431
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,399
of technical debt i hope that uh

432
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,479
everybody is is on the same page

433
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,760
and you probably recognize a lot of the

434
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,240
things about this

435
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,920
um because as i said it's human nature

436
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,600
to to accumulate technical debt

437
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,360
uh it's it's actually not human nature

438
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,480
to not do it it's

439
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:59,760
actually really difficult to to to

440
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,320
tune our minds to not build technical

441
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,160
debt

442
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:06,800
um and it it's not just in tech it's in

443
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,000
everything you do so plowing ahead so

444
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,439
what the hell do you do about it that's

445
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,639
that's actually what i read

446
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,360
um and i'm sorry it's boring

447
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,320
this is actually the very boring bit

448
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,200
about

449
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,480
what you have to do because the only way

450
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,279
to deal with tech debt is to look for

451
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,680
tech debt

452
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,800
and if you're not looking for it you're

453
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,839
just not going to find it you're not

454
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,719
going to see it until it

455
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,480
until it finds you so um you need the

456
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,920
smartest people in your organization

457
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,600
the smartest people on your teams you

458
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,120
need to get together and

459
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,360
you have to gain the executive authority

460
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,040
to actually do this and take time out of

461
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,320
all the things that are on your sprint

462
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,959
list all the things that you're supposed

463
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,639
to be doing

464
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,399
and say no we're going to actually spend

465
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,839
some time and we're going to be looking

466
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,519
at this because we need to understand

467
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,160
where we are and just just get a level

468
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,079
set

469
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,680
of what is the reality in our

470
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,519
organization how

471
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,519
good are we how bad are we what are the

472
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,199
deltas between how good we think we are

473
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,720
and how bad we actually are

474
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,319
or how good we think we are and how

475
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,760
great we actually are whatever it is you

476
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,120
need to know what that is

477
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:10,000
um i like to go across the different

478
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,959
um teams and find maybe some you know

479
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,639
there's some obvious people like

480
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,760
engineering managers security managers

481
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,519
people like that but there's also some

482
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,959
non-obvious people in in almost every

483
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,399
company in almost every group

484
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,439
there's a guy who everybody goes to

485
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,560
because he knows where their bodies are

486
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,519
very there's a guy

487
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,439
or or a woman who knows where all the

488
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,399
decisions that have been made over time

489
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,000
they're the person people seek out when

490
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,680
they need to fix something

491
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,600
personal like they just bought a new

492
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,880
watch that is really complicated and

493
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,399
they'll go to this person right that's

494
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,199
the person you want helping you find

495
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,440
tech debt

496
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,880
um you want the person who actually

497
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,160
thinks that this stuff is cool not

498
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,279
because it's security or not because

499
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,399
it's development but because it's

500
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,120
interesting

501
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,160
get down that's really important in the

502
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,519
beginning

503
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,360
you're looking for low hanging fruit

504
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,839
you've got to start somewhere um

505
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,800
you know when you're eating an elephant

506
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,040
you should just

507
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,240
start with the first bite um start with

508
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,599
the low-hanging fruit

509
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,600
look at the scans that you have of

510
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,120
things that are public get scans of

511
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,720
things that are public this should not

512
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,760
cost you any money you should be able to

513
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,160
find this

514
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,120
actually at almost no cost right but

515
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,959
take a look at

516
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,760
what's showing up like are you actually

517
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,599
allowing stuff to go out uh using ssl

518
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,279
version three i mean i hope it's not

519
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,120
this any older than that

520
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,399
um are you still a tls one like just

521
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,079
find out make a catalog

522
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,360
show what it is that's facing forward

523
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,560
and this is how they talk and this is

524
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,120
what they do

525
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,399
do this absolutely everywhere um what do

526
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,160
all your domains look like

527
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,600
how many domains do you have who holds

528
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,199
your domains where do you

529
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,800
uh you know where do you register them

530
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,479
and who has the registry of domains and

531
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,439
who's making sure that that those things

532
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,360
are all done

533
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,759
uh correctly are you spending too much

534
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,279
money there is that is that tech debt uh

535
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,560
just just the simple way right some of

536
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,279
them at godaddy and some of them are at

537
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,279
google

538
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,880
or do you actually have a plan so figure

539
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,720
that out and write that down

540
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,000
what do i p intelligence firms think

541
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,759
about you how do you look to the

542
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,240
security community do you show up

543
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,839
in uh in threat feeds do you show up in

544
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,839
different places right this is

545
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,279
really really low hanging fruit and it's

546
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,720
just the first way to go this will take

547
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,759
you some time

548
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,360
to to get to now

549
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,759
the best thing to do is take a look at

550
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,880
the work that you've already done

551
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,399
um strictly in security right so you've

552
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,279
probably done external pinterest you've

553
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,759
probably done

554
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,959
maybe even some internal pen tests go

555
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,320
back and take a look at all the pen

556
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,040
tests you can find over the last couple

557
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,079
of years

558
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:27,120
and start to look not just

559
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,239
at um do the same things keep coming up

560
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,000
in pen tests that's

561
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,360
you know obviously something to think

562
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,639
about

563
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,079
but when you get the findings

564
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,839
have you made tickets for each one of

565
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,800
those those findings and have you

566
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,800
actually

567
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,040
remediated all those tickets and if not

568
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,599
why not and you know are they still open

569
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,639
um did did you declare ticket bankruptcy

570
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,839
and you just got rid of it because it

571
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,920
was too hard

572
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,199
that's by the way if you had to declare

573
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,479
a ticket bankruptcy

574
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,920
that is an absolutely like first rate

575
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,920
indicator that you've got

576
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,279
more tech more tech debt than you can

577
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,040
handle um if

578
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,199
you start to see across a number of

579
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,000
different projects that that

580
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,240
new things get abandoned because they

581
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,520
are

582
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,160
really hard because there's all these

583
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,799
blockers fantastic indicator that you've

584
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,720
got

585
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,918
that is blocking your way and you're

586
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,799
gonna have to deal with it

587
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,799
um what do the findings are what they

588
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,400
tell you about the kinds of bugs

589
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,679
that testers continually service they

590
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,959
might be a little bit different but if

591
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,480
they're all of the same

592
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,480
ilk and just to make it really simple

593
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,559
you know if it's cross-site scripting

594
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,559
why is that why does that keep on happen

595
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,520
um and that can go back to a bunch of

596
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,080
different things like testing and

597
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,760
training

598
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,199
it can go back and and by the way if

599
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,840
you're getting back into that and you're

600
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,120
starting to look into code repos then

601
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,120
all these things will end up with

602
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,239
different rabbit holes you know the the

603
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,080
next thing that i wanted

604
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,600
that i'll probably want to dig into and

605
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,320
these things will just pop out at you

606
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,678
right is

607
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,280
well if i'm not looking at my code and

608
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,799
i'm not testing my code am i burying

609
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,440
static credentials in my code

610
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:55,440
um ask the question uh if you're not

611
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,120
looking for it github is

612
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,720
giving us a bunch of help but a lot of

613
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,840
times you'll find things in there

614
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,760
um and you know

615
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,360
tech debt be gets tech debt so the first

616
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,480
thing you really want to do is find out

617
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,840
what you got and then just keep

618
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,960
following the holes until you're at the

619
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,879
end

620
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,240
it's the same thing with vulnerability

621
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,799
scans right um

622
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,760
look for the patterns they will pop out

623
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,000
um

624
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,679
and and it isn't i don't want to get you

625
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,360
know wrapped around the axle about the

626
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,600
fact you know you've got 1900 criticals

627
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,280
and

628
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,639
they're high and critical and it's

629
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,639
really terrible

630
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,000
i'm actually more interested in whether

631
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,720
you understand whether your people

632
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,720
understand

633
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,000
why you haven't patched because if you

634
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,559
if there is a process where you've just

635
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,600
said okay

636
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,120
you know those are critical but they're

637
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,039
actually just like that that's

638
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,439
not anything that we really care about

639
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,640
um you know tenable thinks it's critical

640
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,960
but we don't think it's critical because

641
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,360
of x y and z that's totally fine that's

642
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,880
that's really good actually um but if

643
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,840
you have accepted it because it hurts

644
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,520
your head

645
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,199
to think about all the different tickets

646
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,240
that you would have to fill

647
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,679
and and answer and and get done and all

648
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,080
the sprints that it would take just to

649
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,760
stop

650
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,439
blocking the thing that's that's

651
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,400
preventing you from

652
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,280
um from from patching those systems

653
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,520
that's

654
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,799
huge in terms of finding technique it's

655
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,000
just not okay right if you're

656
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,840
if you can't write it all up in one

657
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,840
ticket that's a big problem

658
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,480
once you've done that the next step is

659
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,600
to look at

660
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,000
the processes of logging

661
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,959
and disaster recovery your questions

662
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,039
here are really just over and over

663
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,240
can i can i do what i think what's the

664
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,840
difference between what i think i can do

665
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,000
and what i can actually do

666
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,439
and why and and you just have to keep

667
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,600
asking those questions

668
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,880
um the very first thing to do is find

669
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,678
out what you promise other people that

670
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,080
you do

671
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,160
and it's it's never you know it's never

672
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,280
fun but

673
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,559
sit down with the business sit down with

674
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,360
legal sit down take a look at what

675
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,520
you've said you do

676
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,039
um maybe maybe you've promised people

677
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,918
something or even worse you've attested

678
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,559
to something

679
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,000
um and just have a good understanding as

680
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,160
you go in and look at this

681
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,120
about what your promises have been and

682
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,960
then

683
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,159
the questions that you're asking are am

684
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,440
i am i logging when i

685
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,039
think i'm logged i'm really sure um

686
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,480
the best way to do this is through use

687
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,080
cases and

688
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,320
you know i it doesn't matter what you do

689
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,280
for a living you know if you if you have

690
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,720
a an ecommerce site then it's all right

691
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,120
uh customer comes on

692
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,400
they sign in they browse they pick three

693
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,039
items they put them in their shopping

694
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,000
cart

695
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:24,400
they pay their credit card comes back as

696
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,360
not good they put in another credit card

697
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,840
they pay it's successful we send out the

698
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,000
email

699
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,039
okay show me the logs for that entire

700
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,600
experience what

701
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,320
is missing from that entire experience

702
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,678
and

703
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,439
it's fine whatever it is is missing is

704
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,720
missing you just have to know it um

705
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,679
and and you know if you're if you're in

706
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,440
a bank obviously it's going to be

707
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,520
different every business is different

708
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,480
but what you want to do is find real use

709
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,480
cases that are

710
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,679
simple just dead simple like this is

711
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,400
what we do

712
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,120
every day and run through and see if you

713
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,679
can

714
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,639
find that process in your logs and find

715
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,919
the black holes there's going to be

716
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,400
black holes there's always black holes

717
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,840
but just

718
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,000
find out what they are identify them and

719
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,320
then think about what you want to do

720
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,679
um you know are you looking at dns are

721
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,039
you looking at off logs for everything

722
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,720
can you do it for certain dates and

723
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,760
times if not why not those are the

724
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,200
questions

725
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:13,280
um however long you're retaining logs

726
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,559
it's not really the retention period

727
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,399
is not really that important unless

728
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,000
you're regulated if you're regulated are

729
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,080
you really doing it for

730
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,280
all of them but give yourself realistic

731
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,439
use cases um

732
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,440
you know if you keep 30 days and sort of

733
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,520
live stuff go back 27 days and see if

734
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,760
you can actually do what i just said

735
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,039
and if not find out why but figure out

736
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,760
what's what's the delta between your

737
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,879
expectation

738
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,879
and the on the ground truth

739
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,240
failover tests are really telling

740
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,240
those are the ones that everybody hates

741
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,480
to do because they're hard and they're

742
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,600
they're terrible and things can go wrong

743
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,640
and it's

744
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,320
you know it's awful but um think you

745
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,720
want to look at failover tests

746
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,360
less being about compliance or your

747
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,039
annual

748
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,559
attestation that you've done and more

749
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,158
about

750
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,840
right you know if you get hit by

751
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,000
ransomware tomorrow what would happen

752
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,760
and what would you what's the situation

753
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,280
that you'd be in and why and start to

754
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,320
to catalog why and the issues of your

755
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,120
last dr

756
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,320
failover test are this is a gold mine

757
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,840
and this is it's a

758
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,918
deep and rich gold mine and this is

759
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,280
going to give you months of work

760
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,400
to try to figure out what is going on

761
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,840
and why it isn't

762
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,679
where you think it should be because it

763
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,120
almost never is um i was just talking to

764
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,320
my friend ian he's at simpress and he

765
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,799
was telling me that reed hastings would

766
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,678
go

767
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,240
through the data centers um you know

768
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,559
watching

769
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,320
netflix on a mobile phone and like just

770
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,200
yanking out arbitrary cables to see what

771
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,280
happens and

772
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,039
i don't care if it's true it's a great

773
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,240
story it's not where any of us

774
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:44,158
are um but it's a tremendously fantastic

775
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,600
place to be in terms of resilience

776
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,720
and if you can get there with resilience

777
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,080
or if you can think about that's where

778
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,039
you want to get with resilience those

779
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,879
questions i just

780
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,080
just put out there right that's that's

781
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,000
how you get there

782
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,760
you never take anything for granted and

783
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,799
you always understand

784
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,520
the reality of where you are and that's

785
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,520
really critical

786
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,120
when the customer sends you the

787
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,158
spreadsheet because their procurement

788
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,080
weasels have

789
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,520
decided that they don't understand what

790
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,280
you have and they send you the million

791
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,360
questions spreadsheet from hell

792
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,440
it's a good thing it's a better thing if

793
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,439
you do this yourself

794
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,120
and so if you haven't gone to vsa the

795
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,880
vendor security alliance and downloaded

796
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,879
their i think it's like 100 questions

797
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,480
they have a full and a core i think the

798
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,600
core is like 80 questions in full maybe

799
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,440
120 questions

800
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,039
it's all the questions that anybody who

801
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,320
wants to deal with third party risk is

802
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,559
going to be asking

803
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,240
and they're very very straightforward

804
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,840
and most of the answers are binary do

805
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,320
you do this yes or no do you do this yes

806
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,678
or no

807
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,720
if you don't do it are there any

808
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,039
compensated controls if so list them

809
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,880
going through that and taking the time

810
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,120
to do it it should it should

811
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,880
the fastest i've seen it is six hours uh

812
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,158
the longest i've seen or

813
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,400
normally what i get is like it takes

814
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,880
people about a week to go through this

815
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,159
these questions are because they're

816
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,440
critical importance to your customers

817
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,000
they're they're of critical importance

818
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,000
to you

819
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,039
it's a really great reality check it's

820
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,159
also really good

821
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,760
to have it on hand to give to business

822
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,360
development people sales people

823
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,120
and say the first time you have a

824
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,439
meeting with your customer and

825
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,678
it looks like they're asking you for a

826
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,520
trial or it might go to contract

827
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,799
give them this give them our spreadsheet

828
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,279
give them our

829
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,960
documentation about our security let let

830
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,400
their procurement weasel see that we

831
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,679
actually care about this

832
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,880
and now they're going to look at you a

833
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,159
little bit differently and they're not

834
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,039
going to feel like they have to

835
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,600
you know eke everything out from you um

836
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,360
so

837
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,959
there's there's no real prize that's

838
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,158
that's about as much of a prize as that

839
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,279
you'll get for filling in those

840
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,120
spreadsheets

841
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,880
there's a huge penalty for being wrong

842
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,678
right because that question that i asked

843
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,799
about

844
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,559
ssl or tls that's going to be in there

845
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,918
and and so answering that spreadsheet

846
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,480
will give you a lot of the answers and

847
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,080
it's just

848
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,080
fantastic for finding tech debt

849
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,559
just doing the steps that i've said and

850
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,000
you know i only have half an hour so

851
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,240
just doing those steps will take

852
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,840
most people four to six months to

853
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,039
actually flesh those out if you've never

854
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,879
done this before

855
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,640
um i know that many of these might seem

856
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,679
obvious and if you're in a sophisticated

857
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,039
organization

858
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,520
you know you've probably done a lot of

859
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:11,200
these things um i have been in

860
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,320
very large organizations that haven't

861
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,520
done this i've been in very small

862
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,080
organizations and have right

863
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,000
um when i've gone into incident response

864
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,158
uh over the years

865
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,600
almost every single incident response

866
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,640
i've ever done was

867
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,959
a a byproduct of of some

868
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,000
kind of tech debt that i just that would

869
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,760
have been called by

870
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,279
those things and again it goes from very

871
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,840
very large companies to very small

872
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,360
companies

873
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,039
it doesn't make a difference it's this

874
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,080
stuff is hard so people don't like doing

875
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,240
it

876
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,600
um i want to touch a little bit on cloud

877
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,360
configuration because

878
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,439
um it's a vague concept everybody's

879
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,799
multi-cloud i don't know what your cloud

880
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,520
is some people do lift and shift some

881
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,000
people are

882
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,360
completely infrastructure as code we are

883
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,960
wherever you are in there

884
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,959
um you're still probably going to have

885
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,840
some technical debt

886
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,640
um the most important question just just

887
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,678
from a

888
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,039
a theoretical perspective is how are

889
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,240
your whatever it is that you're running

890
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,760
how are they configured

891
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,360
uh and are you doing it against a

892
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,120
baseline and

893
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,199
what's the reality on the ground so

894
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,399
however many you have

895
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,120
um and is it meeting the expectations of

896
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,440
your baseline

897
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,799
and you and if you haven't done this

898
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,320
first thing monday go out and get either

899
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,200
scout suite which is free or cloud

900
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,360
conformity which

901
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,120
got bought by train micro uh get the i

902
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,959
think they have a free trial

903
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,719
run it just run it and it will dump it

904
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,480
out really really fast it is the most

905
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,080
eye-opening breathtaking thing you'll

906
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,000
ever see because it'll show you any

907
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,678
everything in your cloud environment

908
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,039
and how it's configured and it'll be set

909
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,440
it'll it'll sit there and tell you you

910
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,600
know

911
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,200
41 of your snapshots are not encrypted

912
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,719
and you know a bunch of your instances

913
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,840
are not encrypted and they're sending

914
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,720
things out or your firewalls are

915
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,279
misconfigured

916
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,720
whatever it is you'll get a list and uh

917
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,559
with cloud conformity it's actually done

918
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,880
in low medium and high and critical

919
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,720
which is really really nice um so that's

920
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,919
that's something really to do to get a

921
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,320
sense of where you are

922
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,919
in in your cloud configuration find out

923
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,918
that's the most important and then dig

924
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:04,159
in i will leave you on this

925
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,159
it's this is like new york city it'll be

926
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,640
a nice city when it's done

927
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,799
tech debt is not done you're it's not a

928
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,120
project that you do once and you're done

929
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,440
unless you're really unlucky it's a

930
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,559
process and it absolutely has to be so

931
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,640
there are

932
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,600
literally there's two ways to deal with

933
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,039
it

934
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,000
you do it constantly alongside

935
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:27,039
development

936
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,240
and collaboratively with all of

937
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,960
of dev or you don't do that and you

938
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,000
accumulate

939
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,080
so much tech debt that you

940
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,039
get to a point where you have to stop

941
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,080
everything

942
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:41,840
and shut down for a month or two months

943
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,879
or three months

944
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:47,840
and go back and fix everything and just

945
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,679
refactor everything and then you'll go

946
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,959
and do it constantly as an effort

947
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:55,679
alongside dev there is no third option

948
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,200
these are your only options so it's and

949
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,480
i will say this like people say well

950
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,080
that's really hard

951
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,840
or that's really expensive or i don't

952
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,918
have the resources to do that

953
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:08,559
it will never be easier or cheaper

954
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,200
to do this than it is today every day

955
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,200
you wait

956
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:15,200
it gets harder and more expensive to do

957
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,200
it you should start today

958
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,639
one thing that i'm doing now and we're

959
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,320
just starting this so i can't really

960
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,600
tell you if it's successful i'm really

961
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,760
hopeful that it will be

962
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,158
uh is thinking about embeds and forward

963
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,440
deployment um

964
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,720
what we're doing is getting forward

965
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,000
deployment of developers from every

966
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,600
squad into security

967
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,200
so they will come and they'll come to

968
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,039
our stand-ups and

969
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,720
uh ultimately we'll send our security

970
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,000
engineers into their standups

971
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,919
once a week it's not it's nothing

972
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,399
serious but but what we end up with is

973
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,559
we we start to to get collaboration we

974
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,158
start to get evangelism on both sides

975
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,080
and we start to really get to know some

976
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,760
of the people who are making decisions

977
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,360
um i would i would recommend that you

978
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,559
get people who think it's cool who think

979
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,520
that it's interesting who think that

980
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,279
it's fun if you just

981
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,639
if you force somebody and frog marks

982
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,360
them into our stand up it's not really

983
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,600
going to be very

984
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,520
very productive but there is at least

985
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,240
one person in every squad who's going to

986
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,679
be

987
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,679
uh who's going to think that this is

988
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,919
neato that's the guy you want

989
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,279
um and another thing is embedding we're

990
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,240
making

991
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,960
ssre security site reliability engineer

992
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,279
um

993
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,039
if we think about since i said where

994
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,720
infrastructure is code if we think about

995
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,158
our security not from the standpoint of

996
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,360
guys and hoodies but like

997
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,720
guys in um

998
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,479
guys who are looking for resilience guys

999
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,000
we're looking to make things work then

1000
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,039
it really comes down to security by

1001
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,720
virtue of

1002
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,158
excellent configuration that's really

1003
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,679
what the bottom line is

1004
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,399
and the only way that i think that that

1005
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:39,520
can really work is if we are

1006
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:41,120
hand in glove with sre because they're

1007
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,559
they are where the rubber meets the road

1008
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:46,559
and in some ways so are we so having a

1009
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,279
security site reliability engineer

1010
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,600
somebody who

1011
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,200
who stands up with sre but but is really

1012
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,240
mainly focusing on the parts of our

1013
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,159
infrastructure that are

1014
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,000
directly related to security we're

1015
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,679
thinking that that's going to be a very

1016
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,480
successful role

1017
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,279
i am now uh done with my presentation no

1018
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,039
i'm not

1019
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:07,039
sorry um i i thought of this because

1020
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,080
you actually when the military did this

1021
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,080
um they

1022
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,199
found that reporters they got better

1023
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,639
reporting

1024
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,559
um because the reporters actually had

1025
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,760
skin in the game now sometimes that that

1026
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,639
meant that the the reporters were

1027
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,919
throwing it in on the side of the

1028
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,039
military they were biased towards the

1029
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,320
military but a lot of times what it

1030
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,760
really meant was that the reporters had

1031
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,559
a better contextual understanding of

1032
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,760
what was happening

1033
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,840
that's what i'm seeking here i think

1034
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,000
it's really really clever

1035
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,039
as a way as a way to work so here's my

1036
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,520

1037
