1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
time but i'll see what i can do it's

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:04,240
driving me nuts it's kind of getting the

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,240
head too warm all right so

4
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,599
we have 35 40 minutes and we have 101

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,040
slides to go through so let's get on

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,360
with this and have a little bit of fun

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,639
um intro sliders obviously a nice one

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,759
with just like the the

9
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,439
whoever the heck came up with that

10
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,720
corncon logo by the way this up in the

11
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,920
upper right hand side is freaking

12
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,759
awesome

13
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,199
all right so as it says uh for those of

14
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,199
you that remember the old movie

15
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,039
uh vote for none of the above so that

16
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,720
would be the ideal opportunity in the

17
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,000
ideal situation that we should be

18
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,919
hitting this year

19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,440
unfortunately this is let's face it

20
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,399
probably about where we're going to see

21
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,718
it about it this year

22
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,239
um for those of you can see behind me i

23
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,520
actually have my cthulhu sticker up

24
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,160
there along with a bunch of other fun

25
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,079
things

26
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,760
so brief intro uh for those of you who

27
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,079
know me hi for those of you that don't

28
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,239
uh

29
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,920
background is a researcher obviously a

30
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,279
father to a couple of two-legged and

31
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,640
four-legged things

32
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,719
uh geek and hakka and uh

33
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,719
i'm going to do a quick public service

34
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,480
announcement on this talk

35
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,399
and the reason i'm going to do it is

36
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,160
really because this actually isn't going

37
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,440
to be a very nice and very friendly talk

38
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,720
it's going to be kind of grumpy-ish and

39
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,479
all those other things

40
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,240
i'm also going to put a disclaimer that

41
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,039
i don't have any skin in the game on

42
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,479
this one

43
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,479
we are going to have a long conversation

44
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,920
about voting i really don't care who the

45
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,600
hell you vote for i actually just want

46
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,960
you to get out and bloody vote but i

47
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,798
i don't have a i don't have skin in the

48
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,360
game on this one i can't vote in this

49
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,920
country

50
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,759
um and i really don't care who you are

51
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,280
um i'd i'd actually love to see mcafee

52
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,320
get in just for sure shits and giggles

53
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,759
because it couldn't be much different

54
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,079
than we've had already

55
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,439
um this is your country uh take you back

56
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,039
and i kind of want a fair fight and to

57
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,839
me as far as i'm concerned there is no

58
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,640
assistance a fair fight at the moment so

59
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,040
if you were looking for a good civilized

60
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,600
nice

61
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,079
friendly pep talk conversation this is

62
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,280
not

63
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:48,880
going to be it you have been warned

64
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,680
so uh scroll a moment over now before we

65
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,320
actually

66
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,159
take a look at all of the voting systems

67
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,719
uh we're going to take a look at our

68
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,320
our industry and have a conversation

69
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,280
about that but before i do

70
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,119
i think we're going to have a quick

71
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,960
little couple of conversations from four

72
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,640
senators which is

73
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,240
the reason for doing this the integrity

74
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,160
of the election system is obviously tied

75
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,679
to the machines that we vote on yeah

76
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,200
there's the mail in boating but there's

77
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,160
all shenanigans going on around that

78
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,839
that one

79
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,599
but we are going to focus on the digital

80
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,200
voting systems because well we know them

81
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,879
fairly intimately unfortunately and

82
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,480
obviously despite looking at those

83
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,319
voting systems and despite there only

84
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,160
being a certain number of

85
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,238
individuals and organizations that can

86
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,920
do anything about it

87
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,360
the industry itself does not seem to

88
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,518
have stepped up as effectively as

89
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,400
possible which is why we'll go into that

90
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,959
but first let's take a bit of a look at

91
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,800
our

92
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,080
industry information security

93
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,239
information technology

94
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,200
call it whatever you want to call it um

95
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,440
for good or for bad

96
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,440
uh information and our business is

97
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,200
booming it feels a little bit like the

98
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,160
wolf of wall street unfortunately at the

99
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,280
moment

100
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,799
we are spending more and more and more

101
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,959
money

102
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,879
uh i mean it's absolutely ridiculous how

103
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,840
much money we have spent now obviously

104
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,480
this year

105
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,239
i mean 2020 and the year of who the hell

106
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,640
knows what life is coming

107
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,400
whether we will end up breaking that 124

108
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,599
billion that we spent last year or not

109
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,280
is going to be an interesting set of

110
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,879
conversations now

111
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,920
ransomware as we know we probably are

112
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,720
going to be spending more than that

113
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,640
money

114
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,640
but from the remediation and the

115
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,238
tactical span point i'm not entirely

116
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,159
certain if we want so

117
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,440
let's set the picture we have spent or

118
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,879
are spending

119
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,079
billions in the industry and if we're

120
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,840
spending that much you know obviously

121
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,840
logically think that well actually maybe

122
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,640
we're winning or we're doing okay but

123
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,000
well no

124
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:35,359
we are not as it says

125
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,519
6 trillion that is a

126
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,280
huge ridiculous and a number that most

127
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,200
of us can't typically comprehend i mean

128
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,560
even having that much would become scary

129
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,879
and that's how much we're looking at the

130
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,319
damages to hit annually by 2021 and

131
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,319
those numbers and stats are out there in

132
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,319
a bunch of different places

133
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,399
and not only are we not even close to

134
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,599
winning there's a huge argument out

135
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,280
there to say that we're actually getting

136
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,079
further and further behind from where we

137
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,920
used to be

138
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,599
i mean we all remember the day or many

139
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,559
of us remember the days those of us got

140
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,920
gray hair

141
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,280
remember the days that we used to

142
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,040
actually celebrate the fact that we

143
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,319
stopped people at the firewall and they

144
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,920
got to a point where we were actually

145
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,560
well okay we found them

146
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,359
and now our best level of celebration is

147
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,000
we catch

148
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,000
somebody inside the area before it gets

149
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,959
to you know the 197

150
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,560
average days um and those numbers we all

151
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,160
know they're all over the place we all

152
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,600
know that our own industry doesn't have

153
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,600
good statistics

154
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,280
so i've kind of gone with the mean

155
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,080
average of statistics because we have

156
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,520
everything from like 50 or 60 or 70 days

157
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,440
all the way up to the yahoos of this

158
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,719
industry which are you know several

159
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,160
years before they realize they've got

160
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,160
their ass handed to them

161
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,840
not only do we actually not not only we

162
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,639
not able to actually understand when

163
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,479
somebody's in

164
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,160
when we eventually find the buggers that

165
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,400
have got into our systems

166
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,479
um it's gonna take us another on average

167
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,159
70 days to actually get somebody the

168
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,960
hell out of the network

169
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,800
so you know and then again this is all

170
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,638
subjective to some degree because we

171
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,160
don't have good numbers on this

172
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,360
um the phishing attacks the amount of

173
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,039
companies that have phishing attacks the

174
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,720
amount of organizations that have the

175
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,440
material breached

176
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,759
um the stats the statistics suck you

177
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,800
know

178
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:13,280
our probability of being attacked

179
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,880
has gone up significantly you know we

180
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,960
see this obviously with the last six to

181
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,360
nine months of the covet shenanigans

182
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,440
with how many organizations are being

183
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,759
attacked are being targeted

184
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,880
because we've spread everybody to the

185
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,720
four wins

186
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,320
and we've now put everybody in we're all

187
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,000
working at homes and labs that's where i

188
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,680
am at the moment and so therefore

189
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,199
become a slightly larger target and

190
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,960
easier attack

191
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,199
you take it another way of looking at it

192
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,840
and if you take a look at the global top

193
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,919
30 breaches that are occurred this isn't

194
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,479
us this is global stuff for our audience

195
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,639
that's coming

196
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,080
outside of nebraska and ohio and

197
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,639
everywhere else

198
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,479
we've managed to actually lose enough

199
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,560
information to cover the entire

200
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,880
population of this planet

201
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,160
twice healthcare's done the same thing

202
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,840
you know on average i think at the

203
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,520
moment they are up to like almost 800

204
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,840
million records in the us

205
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,039
alone so they've managed to lose every

206
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,080
record everybody's

207
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,800
record twice in the us so we're spending

208
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,400
so much money

209
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,919
we're doing all this [ __ ] and we don't

210
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,359
see you doing very well at it and not

211
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,960
only that

212
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,039
part of the challenge on this one is

213
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,039
when we do screw up we still manage to

214
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,960
make money as well

215
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,240
we all know all the ransomware issues

216
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,758
and challenges that we have at the

217
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,680
moment and yet there's an entire little

218
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,240
industry that's sprung up

219
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,360
going well when all the stuff that we

220
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,360
sold you failed

221
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,400
because well you didn't implement it

222
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,160
correctly

223
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,198
and all the [ __ ] that we guaranteed you

224
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,800
or we don't actually come with

225
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,160
guarantees let's face it all the [ __ ]

226
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,440
that we told you would actually fix the

227
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,680
problem and keep you 100

228
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,600
safe fails we're actually going to put

229
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,400
another service in place to sell you the

230
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,560
bitcoins

231
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,560
at a profit obviously to make sure that

232
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,400
we can negotiate with the bad guys to

233
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,919
actually get your stuff back i mean you

234
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,440
know as nice as i can put it this is

235
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,440
really where our [ __ ] industry is

236
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,440
now saying that there are going to be a

237
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,318
number in the industry

238
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,520
i got cyber and i've got all this

239
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,080
wonderful stuff i have all this

240
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,758
technology

241
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,960
i've spent all this money on tech and

242
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,520
now my answer is like well

243
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,599
congratulations serve the bad guys

244
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,440
and not only have they managed to spend

245
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,280
money they managed to cooperate and

246
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,360
collaborate much more effectively

247
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,960
they have time on their site they have

248
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,639
patience on their side

249
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,159
and unfortunately and especially in this

250
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,400
day and age they have the element of

251
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,240
surprise more often than not

252
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,318
and if you think about it they're able

253
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,120
to collaborate across different

254
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,880
organizations geographically especially

255
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,880
i want to build an attack platform i'll

256
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,840
pull in a cnc from somewhere else i'll

257
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,840
pull in my

258
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,840
exfiltration from a different country

259
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,638
i'll get all my irc servers from one

260
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,159
other place

261
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,000
i'll pull my code in from a different

262
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,960
country i put it all together and by the

263
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,840
way i can actually

264
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,080
buy these services online fairly easily

265
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,479
and now i can use them to attack you

266
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,520
so really unfortunately this is kind of

267
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,919
you know how

268
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,440
we look at things and then if we take

269
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,960
another step back and look at the very

270
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,960
technology that we're putting

271
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,799
in front of clients and then we're

272
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,120
saying hey you know a fully patched this

273
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,360
will

274
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,800
fully patch that in a virtual this with

275
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,479
this in place and

276
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,479
you know all of your endpoint stuff up

277
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,318
to place and it'll keep you

278
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,400
safe we always use that word it'll keep

279
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,560
you secure it'll protect you and well

280
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,479
actually no it won't

281
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,759
as part of a team at the early part of

282
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,440
this year like end of last year

283
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,960
beginning of this year they did a ctf an

284
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,560
invite only ctf

285
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,239
and you can read the slide just as well

286
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,000
as i can it was basically get into a

287
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,440
windows 10 fully patched fully secure

288
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,720
windows 10 platform

289
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,039
and then get out from the virtual

290
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,880
machine behind it and get the bare metal

291
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,080
um we knew the target in advance we knew

292
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,880
what we're doing there's a team of about

293
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,440
20 of us

294
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,240
and 68 seconds is what it took us to

295
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,200
actually get in

296
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,760
out and do what we needed to do so it

297
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,839
sucks

298
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,279
which basically brings us to this you

299
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,480
know good old not even norton can

300
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:53,600
protect you

301
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:55,680
now that's the adversarial viewpoint

302
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,200
what's our viewpoint where are we in the

303
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,599
world today well

304
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,440
it's not pretty there's half an argument

305
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,880
to say we have less tools

306
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,560
flips out of that is you look at the

307
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,640
amount of organizations that

308
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,239
have a shit-ton load of technology and

309
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,439
tools but don't even either a know what

310
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,720
half of it is

311
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,279
doesn't talk to each other the

312
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,040
technologies don't coexist effectively

313
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,040
one tool blames the other tool when the

314
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,240
damn poor endpoint comes to a grinding

315
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,519
hole we all want to put flipping

316
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,720
endpoint [ __ ] on

317
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,399
and hope that that's going to fix

318
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,560
everything and by the way we're having

319
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,600
to have to justify what we do more often

320
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,518
than not

321
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,519
and on our side we have to worry about

322
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,800
policies procedures and controls

323
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,120
although half the time unfortunately

324
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,240
people don't seem to remember that

325
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,600
so let's see from a uh our standpoint

326
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,279
it's not pretty

327
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,519
you know we're basically we have

328
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,480
competing technologies we have competing

329
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,240
priorities

330
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,720
we have to keep the lights on yet at the

331
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,800
same point in time we still have to do

332
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,000
the basic block and tackling and we

333
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,719
doing it with not enough

334
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,160
people and we're doing it all the time

335
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,040
while so many of the vendors saying that

336
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,719
we're all nice and

337
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,399
secure and safe which is we end up with

338
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,200
this [ __ ] from marketing

339
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,079
um and this is cloudying this is

340
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,240
cloudine

341
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,399
this is clouding and muddying the waters

342
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,440
let's be perfectly honest on this one

343
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,040
as a business owner if i look at this i

344
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,480
look at this and go hey you can keep me

345
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,800
100 secure

346
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,480
you have anti-hacking solutions you have

347
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,160
everything keep me secure from hackers

348
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,279
hello i am a freaking hacker get over

349
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,199
the [ __ ] we are the good ones

350
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,880
so my request to my ask of everybody

351
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,320
there is quite simply when you see this

352
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,240
please do this

353
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,680
um and by the way you're going to need

354
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,920
more tasers because this

355
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:37,439
is our industry this is confusion

356
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:40,240
managed we have so

357
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,720
many competing organizations out there

358
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,920
doing

359
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,519
so many different things that as a cso

360
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,079
or a senior leadership person or

361
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,560
somebody's

362
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,760
tasked with actually looking after these

363
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,518
systems

364
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,880
how do they know where to face how do

365
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,360
they know where to look where

366
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,560
are they going to go for all the answers

367
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,519
some of the biggest problems that we

368
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,680
have

369
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,800
on top of that let's be perfectly honest

370
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,319
a lot of us are gonna love

371
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,319
i gotta take this off i love this but

372
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,480
it's gonna come off the head um i'll put

373
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,279
it back on the very end i almost promise

374
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,880
we'll see um we have a lot of fatigue

375
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,240
these are some statistics that came out

376
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,600
of you and you can see ops ramp and

377
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,680
various other things

378
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,519
how many you know how many operations

379
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,359
sensors do you have that are receiving

380
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,680
so many flipping alerts and then

381
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,519
percentage of people that actually you

382
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,959
know ignore alerts percentage of

383
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,320
organizations

384
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:30,640
that ignore certain categories of alerts

385
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,800
or all the value of the alerts i mean we

386
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,560
are getting alert fatigue and again you

387
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,680
know so we take a look at saw technology

388
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,119
we take a look at all these other

389
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,959
technologies out there

390
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,959
and the problem then becomes one of how

391
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,000
again how do we trust how do we know how

392
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,479
do we understand

393
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,720
the right questions to ask because

394
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,680
unfortunately this is the reality

395
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,760
it isn't if it is when something will

396
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,079
happen

397
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,279
now you couple that with unfortunately

398
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,120
what we have which is a very

399
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,320
narcissistic

400
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,760
uh industry that we're in

401
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,279
you know when we first started this

402
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,959
industry and a lot of us have been in it

403
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,800
from the very beginning

404
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,239
we were looking at solving problems we

405
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,439
were looking at doing research and we

406
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,000
were looking into a lot of things and

407
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,000
unfortunately

408
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
more often than not organizations are

409
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,120
now led by marketing messages perfect

410
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,839
example um

411
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,880
i am not a proponent of clown strike or

412
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,320
dark trace

413
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,639
but i actually managed to sit down with

414
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,279
one of the crew from dark trace

415
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,959
yesterday before yesterday and we spent

416
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,959
two two and a half hours talking and we

417
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,079
talked about marketing messages

418
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,839
we didn't talk so much about the

419
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,800
technology there are challenges with it

420
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,880
and it does you know

421
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,880
it doesn't do everything that it says on

422
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,800
the box but we talked about how it's

423
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,600
marketed and how we communicate it and

424
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,680
how people are not necessarily doing

425
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,440
what it does say on the box in so many

426
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,199
different circumstances

427
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,800
ryan claudia was on a conference call

428
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,880
yesterday with somebody when

429
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,639
another vendor is waving its arms around

430
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,240
promising the absolute earth and you

431
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,200
know wealth beyond avarice and you're

432
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,079
sitting there going

433
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,440
that [ __ ] is not reality and so that's

434
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,199
one of the biggest problems and we

435
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,240
charge down the buzzwords and the fads

436
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,480
and all that [ __ ]

437
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,240
i am waiting to see what we get out of

438
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,600
2020 for buzzwords because it's not

439
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,320
going to be pretty let's be perfectly

440
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,480
honest

441
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,920
um we don't have good acronym control or

442
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,440
management we're almost as bad as the

443
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,360
bloody military these days

444
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,360
so you stand in front of a company or an

445
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,760
organization and you say hey

446
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,720
let me help you i'm going to put and

447
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,760
then we vomit up all these buzzwords

448
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,959
and the clients just sit and they're

449
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,839
going to have [ __ ] clue what you're

450
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,599
talking about

451
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,680
um i do a lot of work with the wiser

452
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,800
training crew we're building a

453
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,359
compendium

454
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,079
deliberately if you go to the wiser site

455
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,639
you'll see the

456
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,920
wisener it's a compendium of geek to

457
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,320
english translations

458
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,000
simple stuff that we're doing so all of

459
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,680
these challenges and problems that we

460
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,600
have in the industry and yet we are

461
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,199
trying to be the grown-ups in this

462
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,440
industry and quite honestly we haven't

463
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:52,319
done it as effectively as we should do

464
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,320
which means our industry is ripe for

465
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,399
attacks because you know an adversary is

466
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,120
going to take us at our weakest point

467
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,120
so really this is where we are let's be

468
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,639
perfectly honest about this

469
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,000
i mean if you don't think it is start

470
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,560
looking in the mirror and asking

471
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,360
yourself a few questions about

472
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,279
accountability

473
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,880
and what you have said to vendors in the

474
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,439
past

475
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,639
so now we've level set the state of our

476
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,880
union

477
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,440
let us have a bit of a level setting on

478
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:22,560
the state of the voting union

479
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,880
um we are to some degree going to skip

480
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,959
past some of the 2018 midterms and some

481
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,240
of the [ __ ] that's gonna happen so far

482
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:32,959
with a few notable exceptions let's see

483
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,240
hamilton county in ohio voting systems

484
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,719
rejected ballots

485
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,320
uh you have detroit free press in

486
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,199
georgia voters waiting more than a bunch

487
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,199
of hours

488
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,639
south carolina vote machines were

489
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,800
changing votes uh

490
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,440
this is all 2018 you know new york city

491
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:51,359
broken ballots broken scanning systems

492
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:54,320
um etc etc etc cincinnati basically we

493
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,720
have computer glitches on these systems

494
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,639
now we've had i remember getting my

495
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,160
first cease and desist from debuld

496
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,720
back in the the bush and al gore era i

497
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,360
think that was

498
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,480
uh florida a fair few years ago now so

499
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,720
we're going back

500
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,519
for 15 16 years or something stupid like

501
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,680
that so

502
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,040
this is not a new problem that we are

503
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,959
facing and yet

504
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,599
we here we are you know several

505
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,959
elections later and we're still going

506
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,720
through these same issues and still

507
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,560
going through these same problems

508
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,240
now before we really dig into them let's

509
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,839
have a nice conversation about

510
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:31,360
voting passwords um welcome

511
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:34,560
to your democracy secured by

512
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,079
the following um on the work i've done

513
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,599
and i will talk about the voting village

514
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,959
defcon voting village in a little bit

515
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,399
because i've dropped a bunch of stuff in

516
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,880
there over the years

517
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,480
but on the work that's been done um and

518
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,600
on the stuff i've been messing with over

519
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,759
the years and

520
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,000
both you know above board and also

521
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,920
certificate taking voting systems and

522
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,360
pieces of software to pieces in this lab

523
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,439
and the one next door

524
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,279
um these are some of the stellar turnout

525
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,519
ones that we see

526
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,639
um everest being the best one this is

527
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,720
the one i absolutely

528
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,079
love because you know we have uh

529
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,600
unfortunately somebody that can be

530
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,959
somebody actually out in the news media

531
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,040
going oh it's terrible

532
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,560
leaked carolina machines and you know

533
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,920
all the voting villages and election

534
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,680
security was

535
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,599
and they to their credit blanked

536
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,120
everything out but uh

537
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,639
needless to say and by the way before we

538
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,839
actually go any further for those of you

539
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,279
really want to know how quickly this

540
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,399
[ __ ] can be broken who don't already

541
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,720
mess around with it

542
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,959
terra hashes has got some amazing stuff

543
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,560
they're brutalists this was actually

544
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,160
this is fairly recent i think this was

545
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,880
earlier this year where they started

546
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,360
actually

547
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,279
referencing how quickly they could break

548
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,560
down passwords it's a little fuzzy i

549
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,000
apologize

550
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,199
uh partly because i only grabbed it

551
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,720
today because i had the old one that's

552
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,959
been out for freaking years

553
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,880
this one i think is updated as of today

554
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,758
and uh or as of this year and this is

555
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,839
the uh

556
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,600
the brutale system going up against

557
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,040
obviously everything from ntlm to

558
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,000
bitcoin wallets all that kind of

559
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,519
shenanigans so

560
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,360
um yeah not pretty too easy to do

561
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,279
so you know going back to our friendly

562
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,959
passwords if you uh if you know your

563
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,800
google through from the uh

564
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,319
the johnny long days and you know how to

565
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,438
actually search for election central

566
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,839
menu password

567
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,280
um it's all in clear text so as nice as

568
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,559
it was for them to black it out doesn't

569
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,918
really do a damn thing because welcome

570
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,439
to the internet

571
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,039
so if you really want to have some fun

572
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,959
with this stuff take a look at all the

573
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,319
instruction manuals and it's fairly easy

574
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,839
to find out

575
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,599
you know all the different election

576
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,198
systems out there all of the different

577
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,079
pieces of software and hardware that are

578
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,919
being used

579
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,359
you can google the election manuals you

580
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,120
can google for the passwords and the

581
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,080
settings in the image you get the idea

582
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,520
it's all in there

583
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:36,320
this is google food being because

584
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,000
so many of the states have had to put

585
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,840
some of this data online

586
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,600
they have unfortunately erred on the

587
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,039
side of putting more data online than

588
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,320
they possibly should have

589
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,600
which means you know a couple of the

590
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,960
screenshots a little bit later on we'll

591
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,320
actually demonstrate exactly what they

592
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,880
have put online

593
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,918
so um yeah we've gone past the single

594
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,360
face palm and the

595
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,919
dumpster phone we're now on a double

596
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,520
facepalm at this point in time

597
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,960
now if we don't think the passwords are

598
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,160
any good well maybe the software will

599
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,520
actually protect us because you know

600
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,919
software fixes everything

601
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,240
and um yeah this is where some of them

602
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,960
is this is uh one that is in place and

603
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,320
is going to be used this november and um

604
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,160
yeah a little bit uh

605
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,678
good old windows 81 and i think that's

606
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,000
one of the nicer ones we found a couple

607
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,440
of windows 7 machines out there

608
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,360
and a whole bunch of others and this is

609
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,600
just you know one of the exposures in

610
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,600
one of the places

611
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,039
if we take a look at some of the

612
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,080
research that has been done

613
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,919
uh micah share a phd

614
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,799
individual actually had these couple of

615
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,000
quotes in here about es and s's systems

616
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,879
uh 670

617
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,480
000 lines of code 12 languages and five

618
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,799
different hardware platforms um if

619
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,640
that's not the epitome of complexity i

620
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,120
don't know what is

621
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,799
i kind of love the third one using

622
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,159
software tools hundreds of potentially

623
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,280
exportable software bugs were

624
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,799
immediately exposed

625
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,639
yay welcome to your democracy

626
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,320
and here's the other problem on this one

627
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,120
is even though people who

628
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,360
know about this [ __ ] and even people who

629
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,399
are even aware of some of this are

630
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,399
running into brick walls when

631
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,240
it comes to actually implementing

632
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,320
something more secure

633
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,280
in this case this is uh coming in north

634
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,280
carolina's

635
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,320
voting board on this one 2020 elections

636
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,879
basically

637
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,240
um the uh election system software

638
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,200
basically you know board members all

639
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,120
this kind of good stuff

640
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,559
they were trying to put some older or

641
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,199
some newer software in place that

642
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:27,120
weren't actually able to because they

643
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,240
didn't have an adequate supply so

644
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,120
they've basically been

645
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,240
forced by the supplier themselves to

646
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,039
actually basically

647
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,799
use a system that as we know previously

648
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,640
is full of more [ __ ] holes than a

649
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,080
piece of swiss cheese

650
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,760
and as you see the bottom quote on there

651
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,159
disappointed with their

652
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,640
zeal to sell products have lacked candle

653
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,559
and not been forthcoming with the agency

654
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,880
and that unfortunately is a fairly

655
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,960
consistent message

656
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,640
and this is why this is a another white

657
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,559
paper that was put out

658
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,080
and this is just one excerpt from the

659
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,918
white paper that talks about the

660
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,439
weaknesses in the implementation and

661
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,200
this is stuff we're using

662
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,280
this is an old stuff this is stuff that

663
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,960
is being used in what

664
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,320
month month what are we in now october

665
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,840
aren't we

666
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,399
so what you got about a month and a half

667
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,439
a month and a bit time this is the stuff

668
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,440
that's being

669
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,200
used and then we have a tax scenario

670
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,919
example section nine

671
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,880
and all the votive cancelling the votes

672
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,039
adding votes

673
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,120
changing votes denial of service to

674
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:28,320
votes voter confusion

675
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,918
um it's ridiculous and then we take

676
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,760
another step back and go look at other

677
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,679
findings

678
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,600
malicious software running on machines

679
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,200
stealing votes forensics will find

680
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,719
nothing miss that i love

681
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,080
so what we're seeing with some of the

682
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,000
voting attack systems is the

683
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,840
anti-forensics that we see in a lot of

684
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,440
other parts of the industry again

685
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,439
this is nothing more than another

686
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,440
computer that counts your vote or should

687
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,039
count your vote should we say

688
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,799
i love this one anyone who's got access

689
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,200
to memory cards using the voting machine

690
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,440
and the

691
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,880
under 60 seconds i mean for those of you

692
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,360
that are eligible to vote in this

693
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,039
country

694
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,879
going into that little booth and being

695
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,000
able to walk in and do something to that

696
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,080
machine within 60

697
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,320
seconds i think we all have those

698
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,199
capabilities and abilities

699
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,678
voter machine viruses i mean there's so

700
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,640
much

701
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,159
of this that is a challenge now we take

702
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,679
a step back and go well that's got to be

703
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,000
the worst of it and the answer is well

704
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,960
no

705
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,840
that is not the worst of it welcome to

706
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,240
hearts

707
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,678
voting system and it is apparently

708
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,840
according to their literature and their

709
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,000
propaganda a secure accurate and

710
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,080
accessible to all people

711
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,440
a secure voting system so this is a

712
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,360
really nice one

713
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,960
top right hand side and we'll keep this

714
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,799
going for a couple more pages

715
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,320
the top right hand side was a recent

716
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,760
report that was done

717
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:44,480
on this system and they evaluated

718
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,760
12 different domains for this hard

719
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,520
voting system

720
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,280
and as you can see we're not talking

721
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,799
complicated [ __ ]

722
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,720
our firewall technologies and

723
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,280
configurations adequate to protect the

724
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,400
system

725
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,639
uh fail our password implementation

726
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,400
sophisticated for basic security

727
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,520
we're not even talking about two-factor

728
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,960
we're not even talking about getting

729
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,039
[ __ ] complexity here

730
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,080
we're talking did you change the default

731
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,200
one two three

732
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,720
four uh no according to this and it gets

733
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,159
better

734
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:17,919
out of 12 different domains

735
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:22,000
heart failed every single bloody

736
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:25,440
one of them so they got nothing out of

737
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
12 on a voting set of systems that will

738
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,720
be deployed across this country to look

739
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,360
after

740
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,960
your votes and this apparently is their

741
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,559
advancing democracy for

742
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,720
over 100 years i think they're advancing

743
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:39,120
democracy their way

744
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,400
not necessarily the people's way so it's

745
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,918
like okay they don't have security

746
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,880
controls in place and yeah maybe they're

747
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,919
not very good

748
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,280
at doing some things but you know

749
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,559
they're gonna patch the system because

750
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,280
we all know

751
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,399
this is basic [ __ ] patching is basic

752
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,720
it's simple

753
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,520
it's easy to do and nope they failed on

754
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,799
that one as well

755
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,440
so let's see uh electionware software

756
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,918
servers

757
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,760
uh misting operating system patches this

758
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,400
again came out of a report from earlier

759
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,400
this year

760
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,440
and actually from last year as well so

761
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,360
uh they're only missing

762
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,200
17 critical 49 important so you know

763
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,959
got a little bit of a way to go now we

764
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,880
have missing operating system patches

765
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,760
scab missing configurations you get the

766
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,799
idea um

767
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:21,280
so let's see where we are

768
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,720
this uh this is um already part way

769
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,158
through the slides where are we 50 odd

770
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,080
slides in so far and uh

771
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:29,200
we now have re we have reached the

772
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,199
presidential facepalm

773
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:35,600
so you would hope or you would think

774
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,158
that the three main organizations would

775
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,840
actually

776
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:43,039
step up and go holy [ __ ]

777
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,639
we're useless and the industry

778
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,320
those of us in the industry that have

779
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,000
been bouncing up and down for a number

780
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,600
of years talking about this

781
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
hey we'll actually pay attention to them

782
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,480
we we will actually care about them

783
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,919
but unfortunately this is the current

784
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,480
set of answers to the election

785
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,159
challenges and by the way

786
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,600
there's a there's a whole set of i'll

787
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,600
talk about the corruption document in a

788
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,480
second but there's a whole set of work

789
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,039
on here

790
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,559
um propublica.org actually has some

791
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,200
really interesting articles on this

792
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,799
stuff

793
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,640
it talks about the market for voting

794
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,000
machines is broken and you know the fact

795
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,240
that basically all three of these

796
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,520
companies esns being the worst one

797
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,480
has been thriving on this for years um

798
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,320
so it talks about this you know

799
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,000
louisiana campaign financing the

800
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,158
company's litigiousness creating

801
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,039
barriers to competition etc etc etc

802
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,880
basically

803
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,559
if you step up or you step forward and

804
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,159
say the [ __ ] that you've sold me is crap

805
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,760
they'll send in the lawyers before they

806
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,720
send in the text they have more lawyers

807
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,200
and they have texts

808
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,360
that's part of the problem not only that

809
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,760
we have an entire corruption document

810
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,678
40 pages of corruption document where

811
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,360
you've got pay for play schemes you've

812
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,440
got secretary of state with you know

813
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,120
souls i mean you get the idea it's it's

814
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,760
a [ __ ] show out there to be perfectly

815
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,520
honest

816
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,360
uh this document is available on the

817
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,960
internet just feel free to do a quick

818
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,719
google search for

819
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,960
any of the stuff in the ess corruption

820
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,799
document the themes in it the topics on

821
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,400
it the whole lot so

822
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,400
we have picked on those last couple of

823
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,080
slides only an ess but obviously you

824
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,559
know necessary dominion and heart have

825
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,039
failed

826
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,480
really really badly and the problem is

827
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:14,080
they're all as bad as each other

828
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,279
so you know in summary uh

829
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,559
on this piece anyway that we don't

830
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,840
actually need to hack the demolition

831
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,360
system let's be perfectly honest we're

832
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,918
capable of cocking the whole damn system

833
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,360
on ourselves

834
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,279
i mean it's amazing we're out there

835
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,000
we're blaming russia we're blaming china

836
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,760
we're blaming

837
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
every effect [ __ ] we're blaming each

838
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,520
other democrats are blaming republicans

839
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,960
republicans are blaming democrats

840
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,320
apparently nobody's blamed the green

841
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,600
party i think it's time to blame the

842
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,399
green party for something for five

843
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,039
minutes

844
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,279
um but why bother i mean the [ __ ] that

845
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:43,520
we're using to push that button

846
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:46,880
is so screwed it's ridiculous

847
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,879
so where does it leave us

848
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,480
let me put this one up i like this one

849
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,080
this actually comes out of i think the

850
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,200
darwin awards which is you know

851
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,439
unfortunately

852
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,760
most of the population outside of our

853
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,120
industry is relatively blissfully

854
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,440
unaware

855
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,559
of what the hell is going on they don't

856
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,640
typically see

857
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:08,080
this full picture now the one exception

858
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,679
to that and again it's not really an

859
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,879
exception because it's still our

860
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,080
industry so i would argue if i really

861
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,919
can that we look

862
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,600
at the uh the voting village so the

863
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,520
defcon voting village i think somebody

864
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,600
was talking earlier on as well

865
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,879
to me has been absolutely [ __ ]

866
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,199
amazing um

867
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,480
the fact that they have taken up a

868
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,679
stance and said

869
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,360
we need people to understand what's at

870
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,360
risk with the democracy we need people

871
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,879
to understand the organizations

872
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,279
and we need people to understand this is

873
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,799
just 2019 i mean voting village has been

874
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,480
out there for a couple of years

875
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,400
obviously the vulnerabilities in the

876
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,080
environment the systems the architecture

877
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,320
et cetera et cetera et cetera

878
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,439
defcon put out a report i think i might

879
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,200
have a copy of it or

880
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,880
it's fairly easy to find defcon put out

881
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,000
an amazing report the voting village

882
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,240
folks put out

883
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,279
a fantastic report on this i would

884
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,880
hugely encourage

885
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,320
everybody to please take a couple of

886
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,480
minutes download it

887
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,360
and look at this and as it says four

888
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,039
main areas

889
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,399
commercial system remains vulnerable to

890
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,760
attacks we know that

891
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,600
we honestly want to look at paper

892
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,360
ballots and the risk limiting stuff then

893
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,600
ballot marketing devices are shipped to

894
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,360
oh and the infrastructure sucks as well

895
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,279
and so this is kind of what i like about

896
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,199
it

897
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,559
independent security experts and hackers

898
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,880
are stepping into the breach and that's

899
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,918
right a bunch of us are trying to raise

900
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,600
the awareness

901
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,600
so that people can actually affect

902
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,120
change now here's the challenge

903
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,399
we can't affect change we don't seem to

904
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,918
be able to affect change very well

905
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,479
because we're going up against some of

906
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,799
the biggest

907
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,000
organizations with unfortunately the

908
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,320
policy makers in their

909
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,240
pocket and enough money to attack but

910
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,520
with enough voices i think all of us

911
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,279
need to stand up and say hey

912
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:45,918
this shit's wrong so we've got a clue

913
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,279
and we know what's going on but we're

914
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,720
still screwed to some degree because

915
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,600
unfortunately you know we still blame

916
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,840
somebody

917
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,918
let's face it those are the uh infamous

918
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,760
blame dice that were created and

919
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,840
are absolutely amazing and we always

920
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,360
look to blame somebody else and i think

921
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,959
that's part of the problem as well

922
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,279
israeli if offer do we actually look in

923
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,720
the mirror and go hmm what can we do

924
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,320
about and if you look there's actually

925
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,120
some amazing work that's been done out

926
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,000
there

927
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,918
on election interference and uh you know

928
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,760
pot calling cattle black we

929
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,240
are we i mean i'm part of the us these

930
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,840
days we are the worst we have had 81

931
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,039
interventions in everybody else's

932
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,559
elections

933
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,399
so if somebody is actually [ __ ]

934
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,918
around with us uh we kind of deserve it

935
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,279
let's be perfectly honest and maybe we

936
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,520
should have been aware of it and maybe

937
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,679
we should do something about it

938
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,840
so um a little bit more on that one so

939
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,279
why are we in such a mess we have

940
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,399
10 15 minutes to have a conversation

941
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,640
about this so i'm going to run through

942
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:38,879
these last few slides really quickly

943
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,960
let me take you back to your youth um as

944
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,559
kids uh we all get told when

945
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,919
our guardians or parents took us into

946
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,480
the kitchen don't touch the stove it's

947
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,080
hard

948
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,520
don't touch the ready kettle it's all

949
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,158
what do we do we touched the stupid

950
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,639
thing

951
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,559
and as uh young kids we did this this

952
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,600
was amazing it was ideal it was the

953
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,799
right thing to do

954
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,639
right up until the point we wrapped

955
00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:00,240
ourselves around a [ __ ] tree

956
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:03,039
and as adults this is what we have done

957
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,640
we have to experience something before

958
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,520
we learn it and the problem with that

959
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,240
one is

960
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,760
is we in the i t and the infosec one

961
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,679
especially in the digital world we're

962
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,679
already falling into the abyss

963
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,039
and so we have to take a step and go how

964
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,720
do we educate people how do we

965
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,240
communicate people

966
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,480
much more effectively than we're doing

967
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,159
so they don't actually suffer a burn or

968
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,200
wrap around the tree before something

969
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,760
happens

970
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,440
this is the reason why this is again why

971
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,559
like the wiser stuff that i'm doing

972
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,159
because

973
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,678
if we take standard mathematics and we

974
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,520
take a standard human

975
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,559
this is how quickly i can break into all

976
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,679
of your stuff you know it's about a

977
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,559
minute to get into all the various

978
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,240
pieces

979
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,000
yet when we talk about awareness and we

980
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,640
try to educate the humans around

981
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,320
us it takes much more work and effort so

982
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,919
if you're only going to do awareness

983
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,639
training once a year or once a freaking

984
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,159
quarter

985
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,919
it's going to take you between two years

986
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,799
and 20 years before the [ __ ] message

987
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,240
gets through

988
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,720
at which point is too late i've

989
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,559
harvested all of your people's data

990
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,640
so we have to get better and smarter and

991
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,158
quicker and faster about we how we do

992
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,799
awareness training again

993
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,080
it's back to the human talking about

994
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,440
this again we know it's back to the

995
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,799
human because we've been bitching and

996
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,960
screaming about passwords for

997
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,000
20 30 years and these are still the top

998
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,760
passwords

999
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,080
and yet we're charging off down the

1000
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,360
lines of biotechnology and nanotech

1001
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,439
we're attacking humans and

1002
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,760
we're putting tech into humans with

1003
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,279
default passwords so again we have to do

1004
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,760
something different because

1005
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,799
let's face it this is really where we

1006
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,559
are

1007
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:28,158
this is the state of security at the

1008
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,678
moment we have some really good signs up

1009
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,440
and that's about it

1010
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,960
not only do we have really good signs up

1011
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,799
but unfortunately we've

1012
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,559
gotten into the minutia we've gotten to

1013
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,158
the point where we put so much detailed

1014
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,279
instructions in that we've kind of lost

1015
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,880
the message

1016
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,480
and we've lost the message so far

1017
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,320
because well let's face it when you have

1018
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,679
to put this up to the very people that

1019
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,840
are around you

1020
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,080
it means we're not effectively

1021
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,840
communicating

1022
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,520
we know that because well welcome to

1023
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,600
healthcare

1024
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,960
this was a slide i put up a while ago

1025
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,279
when we talk about you know how many

1026
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,799
organizations inside just healthcare

1027
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,720
are being attacked and they're being

1028
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,240
done and then i had this slide which

1029
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,519
i've had in there for about a year or so

1030
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,799
and unfortunately as we all know a

1031
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,880
couple of weeks ago

1032
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,240
we now have direct attribution it's not

1033
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,600
the first time but it's the first time

1034
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,960
the news media has gotten hold of and

1035
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,399
said oh

1036
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,600
people who are breaking into systems are

1037
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,039
killing people it's like no [ __ ]

1038
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,559
sherlock it doesn't take long before

1039
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:21,200
that actually happens

1040
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:22,639
so no longer when we screw up is it just

1041
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,559
a computer

1042
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,480
that's actually going to have a problem

1043
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,519
we're looking at humans having problems

1044
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,519
too

1045
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,279
now we talk about actual artificial

1046
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,840
intelligence and how ai is going to

1047
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,720
solve us

1048
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,480
this is my roomba at least two or three

1049
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,720
times a week it ends up stuck in this

1050
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,960
place and according to the robot people

1051
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,000
it's the most advanced you know digital

1052
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,360
autonomous home

1053
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,240
system um ai is not going to solve the

1054
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,959
problem just

1055
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,120
yet as it says um it isn't going to save

1056
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,799
us despite all the amount of work that

1057
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,239
doctrine everybody tells us that they're

1058
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,399
the world's best ai

1059
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,000
[ __ ] ain't going to do anything about it

1060
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:59,439
so what do we do about it and i got

1061
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,679
about 10

1062
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,080
10-ish minutes to talk about this so

1063
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,600
let's have this conversation

1064
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,240
how about we actually do something we go

1065
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,158
back to some simple stuff we communicate

1066
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,120
more effectively we cooperate

1067
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,000
and we collaborate i've got coordination

1068
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,879
in there but to me it's

1069
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,320
communication and cooperation we need to

1070
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,679
do this more effectively not just

1071
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,600
amongst ourselves

1072
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,440
uh to quote rachel arnold get the hell

1073
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,559
off of our own island and start talking

1074
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,480
to everybody else

1075
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:28,480
but also start talking to everybody else

1076
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,720
in their language

1077
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,559
when we walk into a pen test and we go

1078
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,440
uh you know we're gonna attack you with

1079
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,120
cali

1080
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,360
great so you're gonna use a piece of

1081
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,360
software named after the goddess of

1082
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,039
death and destruction splendid i look

1083
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,240
forward to the results of that one

1084
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,679
i'm not only going to do that you're

1085
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,279
going to attack me with a pony in a

1086
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,559
pineapple

1087
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:51,200
okay i look forward to that report start

1088
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,559
[ __ ] talking english to people stop

1089
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,720
with all this technical [ __ ] start

1090
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:57,039
talking english and by the way walk in

1091
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,279
with coffee and donuts or tea and donuts

1092
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,039
in my case or team biscuits actually

1093
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,039
you'd be amazed at the amount of

1094
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,240
cooperation and collaboration you get

1095
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,240
when you walk in

1096
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,399
with a mug of coffee for everybody or

1097
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,559
tea and pastries

1098
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:12,320
all of a sudden the network team who

1099
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,399
doesn't like me or the database or the

1100
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,000
developers who don't want to talk to me

1101
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:19,360
work into the bloody meeting with that

1102
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,679
stuff break the barriers down

1103
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,799
but back to that one for any of you who

1104
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,039
know randall monroe

1105
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,639
xkcd you'll realize a lot of what he

1106
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:29,360
says and a lot of what he explains is

1107
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,200
applicable to everybody he is able to

1108
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,240
communicate effectively across all

1109
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,559
levels

1110
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,919
we have to do the same go get this book

1111
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,399
read the ready thing

1112
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,919
and then start using that as we talk

1113
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,039
about things the previous conversation i

1114
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,960
was listening to

1115
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,240
talking about quantum computing i loved

1116
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,840
it because i love most of it because i

1117
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,240
understand it's part of my background

1118
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,918
but it was also done in mostly plain

1119
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,600
english that we can understand so learn

1120
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,080
from that place

1121
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,639
we need to ask more questions we need to

1122
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,918
trust

1123
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,880
less and ask more trust then validate

1124
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,240
has now been told

1125
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,559
to validate to hell and then maybe trust

1126
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,159
if i don't feel quite so cynical

1127
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,159
we have to ask more questions when the

1128
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,079
vendor comes in and tells you that the

1129
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,320
shiny piece of 2020 ship with the new

1130
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:15,040
blink light will fix all your problems

1131
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,560
after you have tasered them ask them

1132
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,320
more questions i have

1133
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,000
lists of stuff many of us in this

1134
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,040
industry have lists of stuff to ask

1135
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,440
people collaborate

1136
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,800
devsecops end of discussion all day

1137
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,960

technology all the time take a step back

1157

let's talk about the people and the

1158

talking about mental health hacking

1163
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,800
this is huge and i think it's something

1164

we're not doing that especially the last

1165

1174
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,440

and help make a difference so stop

1183
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,920
blaming everybody start working more

1184
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,280
effectively together

1185
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,960
all right i got three minutes to go

1186
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,400
through these last couple of slides

1187
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,000
this is the stuff i was working on i was

1188
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,599
going to talk at length about tractors i

1189
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,960
was going to piss off john deere and

1190
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,400
cargill and i was going to talk about

1191
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,160
how we're basically

1192
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,839
stopping or working on stopping water

1193
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,560
from flowing tractors from running crops

1194
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,000
and growing

1195
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,599
um those are three things we're working

1196
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,800
on again we focused on them years ago

1197
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,480
jesse and i did

1198
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,560
and now there's a small team of us which

1199
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,000
is researching on the stuff at 2021 so

1200
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,560
if i get invited back to hong kong next

1201
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,560
year

1202
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,078
i will give you a full demo of exactly

1203
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,680
how to stop a tractor from running and

1204
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,320
exactly how to stop corn from growing in

1205
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,680
a field

1206
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:26,800
yay for us this we

1207
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,520
need to stop blaming everybody else look

1208
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,079
in the mirror

1209
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,200
and go what did i do wrong that i could

1210
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,400
have changed

1211
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:37,439
how can i be more accountable how can i

1212
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,359
do something different about this this

1213
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,200
one's huge to me because we do spend so

1214
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,880
much time blaming everybody else

1215
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,160
we don't spend enough time going what

1216
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,000
could i have done differently could i

1217
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,078
have communicated something differently

1218
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,160
to leadership or to anybody around me

1219
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:51,359
could i have collaborated more

1220
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,040
effectively

1221
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:55,359
should i have asked more questions of

1222
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,440
this dumbass vendor that came in

1223
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:59,520
promising me you know earth eternity and

1224
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,079
a free [ __ ] steak dinner

1225
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,320
um quit that [ __ ] spend more time please

1226
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:08,000
thinking about a tribute attribution

1227
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,599
all right last couple of slides um i

1228
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,040
like this one i like it for a bunch of

1229
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,880
different reasons we've all come

1230
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,880
into this industry we all come at these

1231
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,160
problems from different directions

1232
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:21,359
but we are all in this together no

1233
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:23,598
two ways about it um i cannot

1234
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:25,200
overemphasize that one this is a fight

1235
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:28,560
that we're all in together

1236
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,078
and quite honestly as part of that if we

1237
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,240
fight this as individuals

1238
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,320
we will fail or as individuals we're

1239
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:37,118
going to fail if we actually collaborate

1240
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:40,480
and work more effectively together

1241
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:42,960
we do stand the chance of succeeding

1242
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,680
so that is my closing request spend more

1243
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,520
time communicating and collaborating

1244
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,040
when you want to berate somebody take a

1245
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,800
step back and go why

1246
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,480
what can i do differently with this

1247
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,160
situation turn around

1248
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,839
how can i approach this differently how

1249
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,680
can i look at things differently

1250
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:59,040
with the voting stuff you know i talk

1251
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,598
about the voting village get

1252
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:03,119
involved help them spread the word talk

1253
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,320
to people there talk to all of us that

1254
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,359
are messing around with the voting

1255
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,440
systems

1256
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:09,119
talk to the people in charge start

1257
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,200

1258

1260
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:17,279

1268

35 minutes almost 40 minutes so we did

1269

pretty good hopefully that wasn't quite

1270
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,079
too much of a fire hose for everybody i

1271
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,359
need to put my concord hat back on for

1272

1274
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,520
you very very much everybody

1275
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,119
uh love you all stay safe

1276
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,640
hey chris thank you so much for that

1277
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,320
that was awesome

1278
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,839
we do have a couple we have at least one

1279
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,079
question out there and if anyone wants

1280
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:53,200
to ask questions uh send them in

1281
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,880
um so it's uh the community

1282
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,799
so as the community as a whole could

1283
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,880
scan the nation's systems

1284
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,320
and secure them what would the effects

1285
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,800
be sir

1286
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,240
okay well somebody calling me sir um and

1287
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,839
we can't secure everything i mean

1288
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,040
we already have that when you think of

1289
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,000
it we've got showdown we've got

1290
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,440
everything else

1291
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,359
it's not about i mean you can do

1292
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,720
altruistic hacking some of us do

1293
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:14,799
altruistic hacking

1294
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,160
but you are trading a really fine line

1295
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,680
because the problem is you go in and you

1296
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,118
secure something you don't know what

1297
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,560
else you might break

1298
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:21,920
this is the problem with the altruistic

1299
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,279
side of the world like i'm going to go

1300
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,480
and fix everything no you're not going

1301
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,119
to fix everything you're going to break

1302
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,359
[ __ ]

1303
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,119
so you have to go in and understand to

1304
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:32,480
me it's much more on the communication

1305
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:35,359
side of things all right

1306
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,760
hang on a second we don't have any other

1307
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,759
questions

1308
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:44,400
any other questions from anybody sorry

1309
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,119
there's a lot of noise above and just

1310
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,880
no worries yeah i think we're all set i

1311
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,560
don't have any other questions coming in

1312
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,000
well this was cool thank you very very

1313
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,920
