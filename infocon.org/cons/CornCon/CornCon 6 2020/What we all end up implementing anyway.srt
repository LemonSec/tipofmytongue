1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,560
oh never mind i got it you got it okay

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,280
there we go so used to using the actual

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,160
function key

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,160
so uh good morning and uh hope

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,880
everyone's day is going well

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,000
this is my uh cover slide which should

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,720
warn you that i'm

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,480
jaded cynical and kind of a smart aleck

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,198
i saw this one night

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,920
on uh a twitter referred me out to this

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,320
definition of

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,399
infosec and the funny thing was is i was

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,680
really drunk when i saw it so

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,320
uh except for whiskey i was on uh vodka

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,079
because got dinged by my doctor as being

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,360
kind of pre-diabetic so i had to switch

17
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,000
everything over and create a new thing

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,920
to drink so

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,760
just vodka soda water and a splash of

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,160
key west lime juice

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,599
and as i told him i'm like you know i'm

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,440
in infosec so at least

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,239
once a weekend i'm going to binge drink

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,199
just to wash all the stupidity away so

25
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,239
anyway this uh topic is what we do

26
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,239
anyway

27
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,440
the reason i came up with it is because

28
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,559
i realized that

29
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,920
even though you have all these neat

30
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,880
control frameworks and all this other

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,760
stuff that we do

32
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,039
in infosec from a controls and technical

33
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,000
controls and basically

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,759
technology standpoint ideally all of

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,360
your technologies are driven by process

36
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,119
there's a good dozen things are sold

37
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,880
that we all do anyway

38
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,640
so my standard disclaimer and i'm just

39
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,119
gonna go through make up some time here

40
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,240
a little bit

41
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,960
um basically i'm not perfect i make

42
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,559
mistakes

43
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,119
sometimes i even make the same mistake

44
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,159
twice if i come off as a smart aleck

45
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,720
it's because i am

46
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,079
and i'm also jaded and cynical if i come

47
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,600
off as hyper even though you don't see

48
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,360
me in person and i have my webcam

49
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,039
disabled because i'm extremely paranoid

50
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,280
i'm hyperactive as well

51
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,479
if i do need to slow down just somebody

52
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,240
shout out if from

53
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,600
if you can put a question in because my

54
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,280
screen's in full screen and just let me

55
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,439
know that i need to kind of slow it down

56
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,720
a bit

57
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,960
this slides this in every one of my

58
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,759
decks because you know what i grew up in

59
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,839
the 80s

60
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,280
and you know the cold war and all that

61
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,320
and nuclear bombs are cool

62
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,320
so basically what happens is like i

63
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,639
alluded to

64
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,399
everyone eventually comes to the

65
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,119
conclusion that we're here to mitigate

66
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,400
risks

67
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:15,200
risk equaling likelihood by impact right

68
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,200
and then it's all about figuring out how

69
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,040
likely is something to happen if it does

70
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,799
what's the worst that can happen

71
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,160
although that can put you into a chicken

72
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,440
little scenario where everything's

73
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,480
always the worst case scenario in the

74
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,000
sky

75
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,359
it's falling especially knowing how

76
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,120
people move laterally through networks

77
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,239
once they get in they get in

78
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,280
so it's it's it's it's it is what we do

79
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,319
as risk

80
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,879
i'm just going to go through a couple

81
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,799
samples real quick like for likely

82
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,160
our systems patched and hardened do you

83
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,080
know that they're not passion hardened

84
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,840
regularly do they require two factor are

85
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,640
they on the internet are they external

86
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,560
facing

87
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,238
what skills would be needed to attack it

88
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,120
is there code or canned exploits

89
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,560
existing

90
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,160
that increases your likelihood of

91
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,480
something bad happening

92
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,200
right potential impacts usually try to

93
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,720
tie it

94
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,040
to financial those are always kind of

95
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,080
funny numbers or downtime

96
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,920
or number of records stolen

97
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,120
bad press all those never been proven to

98
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,359
hit stock price

99
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,480
that much overall when you have

100
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,239
something that you have to announce

101
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,238
publicly it does increase your costs

102
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,440
because you have to notify people etc so

103
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,959
there's like a cost per record that

104
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,319
ponemon puts out there

105
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,319
bottom line getting hacked is going to

106
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,040
cost you money somehow

107
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,920
and basically a lot of us use matrices

108
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,920
like these

109
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,599
basically we might have a four by four

110
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,159
or a five by five

111
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,760
the one here is is a five by five what

112
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,879
it comes down to with getting stuff into

113
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,040
a risk posture is

114
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,920
you know the world can't end every day

115
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,000
yes

116
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,958
anything's possible but how real

117
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,599
probable is it

118
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,959
right so and i've seen environments

119
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,679
where i've tried to put a lot of math

120
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,280
behind it

121
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,120
it still ends up the same thumb to the

122
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,840
wind so much so that

123
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,840
nasa does the five by five as well in a

124
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,560
lot of companies i actually simply

125
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,239
boil it down to a four by four still

126
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,560
allows for gray matter

127
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,239
and other factors that won't translate

128
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,760
into a neat chart or a mathematical

129
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,200
calculation just stuff you know about

130
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,760
the environment you can get a lot of the

131
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,879
uh

132
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,920
knowledge of the environment

133
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,840
specifically into your analysis

134
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,958
so and then the other thing to keep in

135
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,400
mind is

136
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,239
you've got stuff like i'm showing the

137
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,760
cis community attack model

138
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,320
uh basically there's certain ways people

139
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,478
get in

140
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,560
they might recon do an initial

141
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:23,120
compromise they might elevate privilege

142
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,919
move around laterally establish

143
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,639
persistence

144
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,719
steal the data etc that kind of leads

145
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,240
back to why we do similar things no

146
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,199
matter what control sets we're under

147
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,240
whether it's

148
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,400
cis controls whether it's nist csf

149
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,479
controls whether you've got pci whether

150
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,320
you've got socks

151
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,840
basically what it all comes down to is

152
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,080
we're trying to figure out how much do

153
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,239
you want to spend

154
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,280
and that smart comment to the bottom if

155
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,440
you don't agree with me

156
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,359
log on to twitter sometime for some

157
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,120
reason infosec people seem to discredit

158
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,040
themselves an awful lot in the business

159
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,240
areas and when they're in the meetings

160
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,199
with the big kids like the vice

161
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,720
presidents and above

162
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,160
because you need to spend money now on

163
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,280
all of this stuff or something bad is

164
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,280
going to happen

165
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,559
you wouldn't buy five thousand dollars

166
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,799
worth of life insurance

167
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,240
or car insurance for your car to pay

168
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,680
every month right

169
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,400
so you shouldn't be telling your company

170
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,800
to do that either infosec is all about

171
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,479
doing do do care and diligence of your

172
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,520
customers data et cetera whatever you're

173
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,440
trying to protect

174
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,520
and trying to find the right spend

175
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,039
knowing risk never fully goes away and

176
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,000
we all know you can accept it you can

177
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,240
mitigate it you can try

178
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,759
to transfer it bottom line is you need

179
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,600
to not be telling people to spend 80

180
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,039
bucks to protect a hundred dollar bill

181
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,560
that's really risk management in a

182
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,000
nutshell what is the right amount for

183
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,800
your company to protect

184
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,560
per dollar for you to spend to show due

185
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,160
diligence knowing nothing's ever going

186
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,360
to be perfect and if anyone really

187
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,360
really wants to get you

188
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,759
they probably can that's the zero-sum

189
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,160
game thing you'll hear people talk about

190
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,320
so what do we end up doing anyway well

191
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,000
you harden your stuff as much as you can

192
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,080
typically you'll you'll normalize over

193
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,280
the the highest standard and try to get

194
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,560
everything up to that

195
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,400
you're going to do patching slash

196
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,919
vulnerability management they seem to

197
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,359
get bundled together they're slightly

198
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,440
different not all vulnerabilities are

199
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,880
patchable like a blank admin password is

200
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,639
more dangerous than missing some of the

201
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,479
patches you might have

202
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,759
segment your network if you can afford

203
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,440
it i've seen some environments where

204
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,880
people were like yeah it must be nice to

205
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,919
have money to firewall everything off

206
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,280
all over

207
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,680
you've usually got some kind of host

208
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,318
network detection or prevention

209
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,680
you've got anti-malware tools that's

210
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,000
where people start throwing the old

211
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,960
pattern based is useless and the reality

212
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,720
is

213
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,400
stuff like sep in that actually saves

214
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,160
thousands of dollars of nuisance

215
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,198
time and money you would waste so that's

216
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,240
why they're still in corporate

217
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,960
environments plus

218
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,520
they're a no-brainer for renewal budgets

219
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,120
then he got dlp for masochists

220
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,599
i think as people move into stuff like

221
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,680
google's office and microsoft's office

222
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,000
up in the cloud dlp will become easier

223
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,680
and more doable to me it's just always

224
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,639
been massively painful and something i

225
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,080
avoid

226
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,400
you're always going to have an advanced

227
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,840
something you can call it the edr

228
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,520
whatever you want to call your advanced

229
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,960
endpoint whatever it is this year you're

230
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,560
always going to have something like that

231
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,440
not making light of it it's just it's

232
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,800
going to be there

233
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,319
i'm not going to bother putting a name

234
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,759
on it because what back when it was

235
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,520
intercept in okinawa way back in the

236
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,400
early 2000s we called it

237
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,840
uh whips on the endpoints and that was

238
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,919
the new thing that was going to save us

239
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,520
from everything

240
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,159
then you got web app application

241
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,840
firewalls you've got log management file

242
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,520
integrity management is usually forced

243
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,359
on people by pcs

244
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,440
you might have some proxy serving

245
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,400
services and then you'll have sdlc the

246
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,319
whole new devsec

247
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,599
ops thing which is finally getting the

248
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,240
press that

249
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,759
it should get so hardening almost

250
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,919
everyone in the world bases it on

251
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,520
center for internet security checklists

252
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,039
but here's i'm just giving you heads up

253
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,639
where people mess up

254
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,400
you base it on the cis but you don't

255
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,680
customize it

256
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,520
or you don't know what's going on with

257
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,440
the os you get too complex

258
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,799
you try to do much harding at once and

259
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,199
you shut down production

260
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,440
if you enable every setting in a cis

261
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,800
guide you will shut down your production

262
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,319
you have to know what you're doing and

263
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,680
customize it you have to figure that out

264
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,120
if you don't have to have that knowledge

265
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,599
you need to go get it

266
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,120
mvps rule this world meaning you roll it

267
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,440
out a little bit at a time

268
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,720
you gotta test a bunch of it an example

269
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,360
is there's a hardening setting for

270
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,720
windows

271
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,120
that used to be in the older guides

272
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,160
around 2003 2008

273
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,680
os if you set this ip stack harding

274
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,479
sample whenever you traversed

275
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,280
a vlan you would triple your packets on

276
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,280
the network

277
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,799
flat out that's what it did so it was a

278
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,039
really crappy setting it was in every

279
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,960
freaking harding guide in the world

280
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,878
reality is if you tested it you would

281
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,239
have saw in most data centers are more

282
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,639
segmented than they were when they put

283
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,039
this in way back on the nt 4.0

284
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,200
hardening guide so and the other thing

285
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,319
is not applying real world and sysadmin

286
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,800
perspectives

287
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,000
sysadmins need to run scripts you can

288
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,240
have things lock out

289
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,080
after 15 minutes but then have a way for

290
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,519
them to lock the sessions they can keep

291
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,519
running scripts etc

292
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,120
you need to work with your sysadmins i

293
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,880
came from a system in background so it's

294
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,760
easy for me to do because i knew all the

295
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,360
stupid stuff that

296
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,560
draconian security people tried to do

297
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,200
that really didn't do a whole lot for

298
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,640
security

299
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,880
but just made life a pain in the butt

300
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,640
for people so

301
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,839
don't err on the side of turn everything

302
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,279
on when you're hardening you're just

303
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,720
going to discredit yourself and cause

304
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,800
outages

305
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,000
this is the smart alex slide on it i've

306
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,399
seen people do this

307
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
here harden your oracle here's a pdf of

308
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,440
300 pages

309
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,040
awesome that doesn't do anyone any good

310
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,800
patch management prioritization

311
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,959
everyone gets into all the arguments see

312
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,560
it cvss good or bad or whatever

313
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,399
here's the deal all your commercial

314
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,000
products have their own knowledge bases

315
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,000
they do their own ratings maybe take the

316
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,279
top category or the top two categories

317
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,519
and work on those

318
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,519
if you're on a microsoft platform take

319
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,080
all of the microsoft security patches

320
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,519
every month

321
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,200
and throw them out there once you can

322
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,880
get your patch windows established

323
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,240
i know it's easier said than done and

324
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,920
honestly with oracle

325
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,200
anyone in this call that's got oracle

326
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,599
where you're patching it four times a

327
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,959
year

328
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,640
you're doing the best you're ever going

329
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,479
to do with oracle so that's

330
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,080
outstanding by the way getting those

331
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,839
kind of change windows from businesses

332
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,920
for data critical databases

333
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,120
can take two to three years patch

334
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,880
management's not something you're going

335
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,399
to jack in place in a year if you think

336
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,240
you are you're delusional

337
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,839
it takes years to get patch management

338
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,360
going and socialized and build up that

339
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,560
credibility to where it becomes a normal

340
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,519
routine

341
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,599
so then you got differences between os's

342
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,880
servers versus workstations etc

343
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,399
you need to be able to have a way to

344
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,920
handle exceptions because they're going

345
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,000
to come up you're going to

346
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,199
have certain apps that require java

347
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,560
you're going to not want to be bugging

348
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,839
people about it every month if you know

349
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,959
you can't do anything about it until

350
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,839
there's a major rewrite of the

351
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,599
application

352
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,200
bug them then and make sure the

353
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,040
application's being rewritten

354
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,200
you're being able to upgrade your java

355
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,599
as an example

356
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,880
you need to also watch out for out of

357
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,360
band patches

358
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,000
i can tell you in the environment i've

359
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,839
been in

360
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,360
we have done out of band patching 10

361
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,680
times in seven years

362
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,440
and we were right every time if you do

363
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,079
out of band patching based on twitter

364
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,079
you're going to

365
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,000
lose some credibility because everyone

366
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:53,439
says put everything out right away

367
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,720
you need to find out is it critical

368
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,399
are a significant portion of your

369
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,640
systems vulnerable does it lead to

370
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,640
remote code execution or not

371
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,079
is it mitigated by a current service do

372
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,399
you have a waff that can block something

373
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,239
till

374
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,440
you can patch in your normal cycle of 30

375
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,839
days etc

376
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,120
right is it actively being exploited in

377
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,399
the wild

378
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,000
how many versions of software are

379
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,880
affected these are the questions you ask

380
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,120
us

381
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,720
what i do typically is in my current

382
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,240
world we have a calculator

383
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,160
that everyone on the platform teams

384
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,839
knows about it we run our calculations

385
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,920
add our little tweaks and tunes based on

386
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,839
our gray matter expertise

387
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,000
heart bleed you need did the patch right

388
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,600
away some of the other ssl ones not

389
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,959
so much because sometimes you look at

390
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,560
what the attack would take and how

391
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,319
complex it is and it's like

392
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,839
you can keep your normal 30-day patch

393
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,959
cycle just make sure you get this one in

394
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,399
this month

395
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:42,640
right so you need to have an

396
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,000
intelligent out of a band patch way of

397
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,279
handling it so you're not just telling

398
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,480
everyone patch everything all the time

399
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,120
based on something you saw on the

400
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,480
internet

401
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,920
you also have to have this because it

402
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,279
protects you from when your executives

403
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,319
do see something on the internet that's

404
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,160
getting blown up

405
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,399
and you can say we don't need this in

406
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,839
our environment here's why or we do

407
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,760
when we call out a patches in my

408
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,959
environment no one ever questions them

409
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,800
because we walk them through how we

410
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,199
calculate whether or not to spend

411
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,160
the money to have the staff working

412
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,240
extra

413
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,959
and to forego other work that's there's

414
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,160
a cost to patching make no mistake

415
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,638
so and then there you go you get your

416
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,480
score

417
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,160
you go with it it's a known assessment

418
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,560
we do the same assessment for

419
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,560
anything that comes up and hits the news

420
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,680
so we get the same level of service

421
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,040
same analysis it's a known issue it's so

422
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,638
you have your out-of-band pro

423
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,480
process is as important as having your

424
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,240
normal patch process

425
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,240
so again biggest mistakes you don't

426
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,160
involve and train other teams

427
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,920
no processes for any destroy that

428
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,199
means when you have service outages do

429
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,719
you have a way to troubleshoot to see

430
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,399
which service was affected

431
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,920
do you have ways to modify your scans to

432
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,079
stop disrupting that service

433
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,199
right sometimes people try to bite off

434
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,760
everything at once

435
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,120
again with here don't throw people a pdf

436
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,639
and say please fix this

437
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,320
set your standards maybe it's only the

438
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,600
top level vulnerabilities in your

439
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,560
product is the ones that you're worried

440
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,800
about

441
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,319
right not doing the math to see how long

442
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,359
your scans take and getting your scans

443
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,760
windows right

444
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,279
is an issue and again sometimes

445
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,160
prioritization can take longer than

446
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,760
fixing

447
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,880
when you get into all these esoteric

448
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,600
arguments about whether it's in

449
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,839
metasploit

450
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,200
or what's the cvss score you're starting

451
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,639
to get into arguments where if you took

452
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,240
your vendor and what your vendor says

453
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,480
and urgent and rolled all those patches

454
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,920
out

455
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,120
your would be patched by the time

456
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,880
you have half these conversations done

457
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,480
so again you know vulnerability

458
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,279
management it does discovery of missing

459
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,360
patches

460
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,720
some of the tools do misconfigurations

461
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,200
some of the applications it'll find

462
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,320
vulnerabilities in

463
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,600
discarding rogue stuff if you do range

464
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,680
based scanning is a good thing

465
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,279
verifying your agents are out there

466
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,519
again continuous process

467
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,959
i refuse to make circle slides i was

468
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,480
once upon a time going to make a circle

469
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:46,239
slide that was literally

470
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:49,120
uh what was it dump wipe

471
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,760
flush repeat so i don't like circle

472
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,480
slides

473
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,800
this one is one that usually is one i'm

474
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,399
going to

475
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,079
go over to a little bit where this is

476
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,360
just more on you can review later

477
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,279
because it'll be up on my website

478
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,120
time of day scanning is important for

479
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,439
remote sites versus data centers how

480
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,959
often you scan stuff

481
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,959
nowadays i've always been scanning data

482
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,359
centers weekly you know

483
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,760
and then range based scanning versus

484
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,279
inventory based to let you catch rogues

485
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,120
haven't found a good way to handle going

486
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,639
across vpns or wireless and again

487
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,160
remediation could be multiple things

488
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,160
hardening patching

489
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,519
architectural changes you might realize

490
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,279
you need more segmentation in your

491
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,800
network based on what you're seeing

492
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,199
sometimes you might need to implement a

493
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,279
tool for something

494
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,479
firewalling again biggest mistake that

495
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,279
people have been missing since the early

496
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,040
2000s

497
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,720
is egress filtering it's very hard to

498
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,639
validate and get the time to end map

499
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,120
around your environment and find out

500
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,480
where the holes are in your firewalls

501
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,320
hard to keep them documented if you

502
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,360
don't document inside the rules

503
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,880
themselves

504
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,000
um the other thing i see people doing is

505
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,839
trying to lock down every important

506
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,199
protocol between every single host

507
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,880
if you have backup servers that need to

508
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,120
back up your data center open up the

509
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,800
backup ports from the backup servers to

510
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,000
your freaking data center it ain't worth

511
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,599
the time to have to enter a change

512
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,040
control to do that for every one of your

513
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,920
thousands of hosts you put on and off

514
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,920
the network

515
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,599
probably not doing a lot for security if

516
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,680
they subvert your backup system

517
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,839
all those individual rules that you put

518
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,959
in and may waste the time doing

519
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,639
they're going to get those anyway

520
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,160
through the backup server see where i'm

521
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,199
at so you're opening up to other stuff

522
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,399
that there may or may not be

523
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,760
addresses there i get that time benefit

524
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,079
cost benefit analysis

525
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,839
pervasive services make service based

526
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:27,680
rules in your firewalls

527
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,880
idps biggest thing i see is people start

528
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,399
putting intrusion detection and

529
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,519
prevention all over the network i walk

530
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,880
in and say so

531
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,800
where's your concentrators for b2b vpns

532
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,079
over there is there an ips in front of

533
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,319
them no i'm like you know that's the

534
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:43,519
easiest one to do first

535
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,600
use your vpns all your vpns put the idps

536
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,120
in there first put the ips blocking just

537
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,160
the 12 major things that go

538
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,680
shitty on microsoft pretty easy to do

539
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,439
make sure you know how failover works

540
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,479
because if you got a single box

541
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,160
you think that's gonna fail over

542
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,800
appropriately versus two boxes connected

543
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,319
to

544
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,160
external taps you're gonna get a

545
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,600
surprise outage you know everyone

546
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,399
oh you can just pull this piece out and

547
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,399
hot swap it good luck with that one

548
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,240
not probably gonna work the way that you

549
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,800
handled it and also people don't budget

550
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,959
for

551
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,880
tuning and maintenance anti-malware

552
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,239
biggest thing here if you have normal av

553
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,320
start playing with the heuristics you'll

554
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,600
be surprised what will do

555
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,959
you still got to do some care and

556
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,120
feeding and you might want to know what

557
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,279
your anti-malware can do for

558
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,160
iocs like something like sup can

559
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,959
actually

560
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,319
uh can consume yara rules so that might

561
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,239
be part of your ilc

562
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,959
consumption strategy that you're putting

563
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,880
in place i hate dlp

564
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,599
it's not data loss prevention it's

565
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,519
preventing inadvertent data loss

566
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,199
and you got to cover in use in motion

567
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,320
and at rest most people miss the first

568
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,758
point at all they actually think they're

569
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,199
going to stop the bad you're not

570
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,639
you're going to catch the dumb

571
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,800
for lack of better terms or the

572
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,800
inadvertent mistakes

573
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,479
advanced end point protection do you

574
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,240
have your heuristics going on your av

575
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,519
first do you have your av fully in place

576
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,360
first or is it just

577
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,399
this sucks it's pattern-based the hell

578
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,759
with it and we're going to put this

579
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,759
shiny new thing and it's going to save

580
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,600
the world which it's not

581
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,959
and are you adding this into your ilc

582
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,640
consumption strategy

583
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,640
have you planning time and staff for

584
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,079
hunting etc do you realize you're going

585
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,199
to have to tune the out of this

586
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,720
thing

587
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,240
what i'm seeing now is sometimes it's

588
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,760
worth paying companies that

589
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,280
will come in and run attacks live and

590
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,640
tune the stuff so you can have your

591
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,839
stuff like a carbon black or something

592
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,439
that'll detect kerberos

593
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,879
right away because that never threat

594
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,959
never really

595
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,079
goes away although if you have thousands

596
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,679
of service accounts and you can change

597
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,440
your passwords long enough

598
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,919
to over 30 characters you can buy some

599
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,640
time on the crack time on it right

600
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,640
laughs

601
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,480
another big one people do not ever have

602
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,840
the time to tune laughs one of my pet

603
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,000
peeves if you ain't gonna have the time

604
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,600
to do it don't expect more out of it

605
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,360
and you'll be surprised how many levels

606
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,719
down you are are protecting your website

607
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,159
when you look into it

608
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,400
and then again you gotta have an

609
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,080
exception process and

610
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,000
a lot of times people don't test any

611
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,199
types of failovers with their laughs

612
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,559
so laughs are a pain in the butt

613
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,640
you're gonna have to have them anyway in

614
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,480
today's day and age but it's gonna take

615
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,360
more time to use them than you think

616
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,799
you're probably going to need to get

617
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,479
people trained on web application

618
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,080
hacking to some extent even if you're

619
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,520
paying for all your pen test externally

620
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,559
which is not a bad thing

621
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,720
you're probably going to want to get

622
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,840
someone up to speed a bit on web app

623
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,000
hacking so they can defend against it

624
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,600
better

625
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,600
wireless intrusion prevention biggest

626
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,320
thing i think is just they don't really

627
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,918
use it

628
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,600
they don't have a process for accounting

629
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,679
for and hunting down the rogues

630
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,480
and they always underestimate the tuning

631
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:29,039
especially in retail environments

632
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,760
log management begin with the end in

633
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,080
mind

634
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,200
figure the 10 or 15 things you really

635
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,960
care about and want to know about

636
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,320
figure out what log sources you need

637
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,200
understand that if you have to do custom

638
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,320
integrations

639
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,799
you're going to have to refresh those

640
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,240
integrations when software changes

641
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,000
understand what audit settings your

642
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,760
device needs to give you the the data

643
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
that you want

644
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,120
so tuning is a lot more than a month

645
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,559
you're not going to put it in quickly

646
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,000
and get a whole lot of benefit

647
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,760
and then again you got to watch your

648
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,720
licensing models is it based on disk

649
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,240
space

650
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:01,360
eps you know events per second etc

651
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,320
biggest gotchas for log management and

652
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,918
again

653
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,840
if you have syslog do you have

654
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,480
clustering so you can take syslog data

655
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,918
in

656
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,440
no matter what happens or if one of your

657
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,120
collectors goes down do you start losing

658
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,960
all your syslog data

659
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,039
how do you back up the stuff if you need

660
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,559
to sizing for peak loads et cetera

661
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,640
and querying and reporting you might

662
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,160
have to offload to separate systems

663
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,520
odds are in a large enterprise

664
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,120
environment which is what i usually live

665
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,480
in so i tend to speak to that

666
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,080
you're not going to do this with one or

667
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,600
two or three box because you're going to

668
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,720
have more than that typically

669
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,240
uba is a nice dream to shoot for

670
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,760
not something you might want to try when

671
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,360
you're first going at it you might first

672
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,559
want to get the 10 or 15 things you

673
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,439
really care about and make sure that

674
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,039
those

675
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,640
can be alerted on correctly and that

676
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,400
they're high fidelity alerts

677
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,760
in other words when you see the egr if

678
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,440
you have an egress rule for anything in

679
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,799
the company that's encrypted leaving

680
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,160
if you're a big enough environment that

681
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:52,400
might not be a high fidelity alert

682
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,240
web app security is just getting better

683
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,360
and better now with the devsecops in

684
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,400
some respect

685
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,240
um again my biggest caution there is you

686
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,760
got to really understand web app hacking

687
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,720
and you got to get invest in your people

688
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,400
so they understand that

689
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,080
fem is an interesting one it gets forced

690
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,919
onto people for pci

691
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,439
it was a good idea when it started but

692
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,120
it doesn't scale well

693
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,480
i almost kind of like doing the reverse

694
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,840
in some environments and just go with

695
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,360
something like canary tokens because

696
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,280
when someone hits a token

697
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,959
that's you know it's a high fidelity

698
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,760
event they shouldn't have hit that

699
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,760
if you're going to do fim think small a

700
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,200
few system files not an entire system

701
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,200
directory of stuff that might change

702
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,200
with regular patching etc

703
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,480
so it's a tough one to put in there if

704
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,360
you're in a pci environment you're going

705
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,880
to have to

706
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,240
if not you might think of turning it on

707
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,840
its end and going with something like

708
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,360
think is canary and doing some canary

709
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,600
tokens in your environment

710
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:45,280
for high fidelity proxies again

711
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,520
in the new world are we moving to agent

712
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,879
based because everything's encrypted

713
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,280
so you're going to have agents for your

714
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,320
proxy maybe your caspian proxy agents

715
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,760
will combine

716
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,520
right and then

717
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,919
again i just put a couple things in with

718
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,480
cloud just to watch out for

719
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,080
basically you're still going to have to

720
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,039
architect your provisioning correctly

721
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,639
key management's going to be different

722
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,640
between on-prem and off-prem

723
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,840
potentially you got to pay attention to

724
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,520
forensics in the cloud

725
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,760
there is a new skill set needed some of

726
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,600
your tools are going to have to be

727
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,039
a tool for the on-prem stuff and a tool

728
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,080
for the cloud stuff as you're moving in

729
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,559
hybrid mode

730
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,840
right and uh the other one i say for

731
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,678
contract fails is

732
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,199
you know when you buy sas solutions are

733
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,640
you making your con your vendor

734
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,480
liable for stuff like make sure they

735
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,240
have vulnerability management make sure

736
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,919
they have penetration testing

737
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,559
right to audit stuff like that there's a

738
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,559
lot to that

739
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,039
byod just increases the fun i'm just

740
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,640
going to go over that one for now

741
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:50,480
um threat intel boils down to a lot of

742
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:53,200
times consumable iocs

743
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,480
i i use twitter i haven't had any of the

744
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,159
commercial feeds beat twitter for

745
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,559
keeping me in the realm of what's going

746
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,919
on

747
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,760
but the commercial feeds are nice

748
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,240
because they're watching it seven by 24

749
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,400
and

750
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,840
me and my team might not be able to so

751
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,640
thread intel's kind of an interesting

752
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,320
beast because

753
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,919
for the stuff i've needed to worry about

754
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,360
i've watched them okay there's an

755
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,960
exploit for this it hits twitter right

756
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,320
away so twitter is actually really good

757
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,480
for thread intel

758
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,559
um i did have to do some tuning to get

759
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,400
it down to just be thread intel on my

760
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,158
feed and dog pictures

761
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,520
so by the way if you ever if if any you

762
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,960
check on my twitter account there's it's

763
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,639
just mostly dog pictures and i'm just

764
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,559
there trying to get threat intel

765
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,240
i don't do well on speaking in short

766
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:31,039
bytes which you can probably tell so

767
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,720
like i'm old i'm in my 50s twitter

768
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:35,360
doesn't work for me as well or i should

769
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,320
say i don't work for twitter or whatever

770
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,199
um iot devices are going to be a

771
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,039
nightmare

772
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,640
one of the things we're doing early on

773
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,600
is just making sure we segment the crap

774
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,799
out of everything

775
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,000
a lot of the stuff you can put on its

776
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,679
own segment let it go the internet to

777
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,799
get its updates it can't come back in on

778
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,559
on your corporate networks you're really

779
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:55,600
going to look into the purdue model

780
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:57,200
that they use for i uh uh

781
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,280
scada environments probably use the

782
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,480
wrong term apologies

783
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,399
you're going to do a lot more

784
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,400
segmentation with iot do not let the

785
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,240
fish tank be on your corporate network

786
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:11,360
right and then again forensics

787
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,760
versus incident response or dfir it's

788
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,360
easy

789
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,640
here to contract out the forensics part

790
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,080
but you still need to make sure your log

791
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,520
management's ready for when you need it

792
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,039
and you still need to make sure your ir

793
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,799
processes are yours because

794
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:25,360
that's how your company responds legal

795
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:27,440
and all that other kind of stuff

796
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,399
and again in security tools in general

797
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,159
what i see

798
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,200
known accounts for run and maintain

799
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,799
you're probably not going to be allowed

800
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,200
to anyway

801
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,400
install versus implementation

802
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,720
implementing a solution

803
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,400
is using the tool within the process etc

804
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,279
it starts with people processed and

805
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,880
technology

806
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,640
just installing a product clicking

807
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,159
buttons enabling features and playing

808
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,679
around and never really reading the book

809
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,039
on it fully

810
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,480
not going to get you that far i can

811
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,600
always tell when someone has an install

812
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,720
versus an implementation an

813
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,760
implementation implies

814
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,440
a process you have your services and

815
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,200
solutions catalog for your team

816
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,799
you know what you do and equally

817
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,559
importantly you know what you can't do

818
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,679
you know what's in scope you know what's

819
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,039
not in the scope you know what your

820
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,600
assumptions are for each service

821
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,720
offering

822
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,719
you have metrics to make sure the

823
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,840
service offerings are carrying on

824
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,760
properly

825
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,959
it's people process technology that's

826
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,559
never going to change

827
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,080
and everyone says this and then you go

828
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,678
into an environment and all you see is a

829
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,720
bunch of freaking tool installs

830
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,559
happens all the time again different

831
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,559
ways of documenting stuff this could all

832
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,559
be separate sections in a document

833
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,678
how do you update and patch it what's

834
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,520
the dr

835
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,760
how do you generate reports how do you

836
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,840
purge data and keep the data clear

837
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,440
if you have integrations with ips's in

838
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,520
the old days ids

839
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,200
and your unix box changes to a windows

840
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,799
box overnight and you didn't tell your

841
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,159
vole management platform that and it

842
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,520
merged the data you're going to have

843
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,679
weird protections coming out of your

844
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,039
automated protection from your ids

845
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,240
 like that you got to think how

846
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,120
you're going to maintain the data and

847
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,559
all this stuff

848
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,719
right so basically to get higher cmm

849
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,559
integration automation's a nice word

850
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,520
people automate too soon in my opinion i

851
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,039
see it over and over

852
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,879
if you don't have a good process that's

853
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,879
in place manually

854
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,559
why automate it or if you don't have a

855
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,080
good process in general why try to more

856
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,520
fully automate it

857
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,799
and you just need to make sure you can

858
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:13,360
repeat stuff this is just a basic c

859
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:14,240
m chart i'm a smart alec cmm5 is

860
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,240
perfection

861
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,919
but really you have no documentation

862
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,960
you're just installing stuff no trend

863
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,159
reporting you're starting to make

864
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,000
customizations

865
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,880
you don't really have a good idea on how

866
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,840
you're going to integrate into the

867
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,240
environment

868
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,320
my goal is usually to get most tools to

869
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,919
about a cmm3 because if you can do that

870
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,240
with the dirty dozen that you got here

871
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,760
which

872
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,360
actually translates to more tools than

873
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,879
just 12 usually especially in the

874
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,399
devsecops world

875
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,760
you're doing pretty good you're probably

876
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,360
spending about the right amount of money

877
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,640
to do due diligence and care for your

878
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,959
environment

879
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,600
so in my opinion too one of the things

880
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,039
we don't do enough of is training

881
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,480
i've got some thoughts on training here

882
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,240
you can go over later offense of

883
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,600
security has very affordable training on

884
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,120
learning how to hack

885
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,918
these are probably out of date pricing

886
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,600
by the way i use the crap out of udemy

887
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,200
for some of the newer cloud stuff i have

888
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,399
a personal account

889
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,080
um you've got cybray proslite port

890
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,320
swearer has good stuff up you just see

891
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,840
i just put links out there because again

892
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,480
i'll get to the

893
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,279
cloud certs i'm going to get to the

894
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,559
website

895
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,840
i'll have the presentation on the

896
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,840
website at some point today

897
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,799
and i believe i've used up the time i

898
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,879
hopefully i didn't go over because i

899
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:25,840
know i had a little bit of a late start

900
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,840
so my apologies

901
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,200
so at that website i'll put this

902
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,720
presentation because you can get the

903
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,240
links to the stuff later but again like

904
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,360
i said the main point there is

905
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,880
people just literally short change on

906
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,279
training i think companies in general

907
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,559
should

908
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,880
put more money into their people on

909
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,879
training

910
00:26:50,000 --> 00:27:07,840
all right i can't hear you

911
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:07,840
could be my issue

912
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,080
i'm not on me

913
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,159
mine show's not on mute

914
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,959
interesting i can't hear you oh okay

915
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,960
sorry

916
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,199
you can hear me now no i can yeah i

917
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:40,399
couldn't hear you so i have a question

918
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,559
for derek from discord um could you

919
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:44,879
expand on what the problem was

920
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,480
with vlan's tripling packets on a

921
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,880
windows network

922
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,720
so it wasn't all of it it was a specific

923
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,000
setting in windows in the tcp stack

924
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,080
harding guide and i always

925
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,080
forget for me the life of it you flip it

926
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,320
in the registry from a zero to a one

927
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:01,439
and when you go across vlans it splits

928
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,120
your packets off into 512

929
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,120
k so you'd end up actually tripling your

930
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,320
packets across vlans

931
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,678
really bizarre it's an old one i'm not

932
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:17,039
even sure if it's in the newest list i

933
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:18,799
just use it because it bit me years ago

934
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:21,360
okay i'm just checking the chat real

935
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:24,399
