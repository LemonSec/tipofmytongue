1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
okay

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:09,200
looks good okay great thanks all right

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,080
uh thanks for those uh that just joined

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,559
uh

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,719
so uh for this presentation uh let me

6
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,600
just kind of give you a summary as to

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,880
why i created this presentation it was

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,439
about 10 months ago

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,320
i joined a small startup company that

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:27,840
was essentially a banking as a service

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,800
and upon joining the company it was

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,399
uh the most you know most innovative

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,960
company i think i've ever joined in my

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,040
career

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,040
where we didn't own anything everything

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,440
was infrastructure as a service

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,480
platform as a service software as a

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,718
service

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,398
the only things that we did own was a

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,559
mobile app uh

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,520
we even paid uh for a little bit of

22
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,718
azure and

23
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,760
also we had mule software api

24
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,760
and also our orchestrator and everything

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,360
on the back end was essentially uh

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,000
software as a service

27
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,160
and so this really created a really

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,960
challenging situation that i've never

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,399
experienced

30
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,240
such third-party risk in my life because

31
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,880
i was just so vulnerable to what

32
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,520
everybody

33
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,119
else was doing and so i started to dig

34
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,000
deep into this role

35
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,360
as their cyber chief and i started to

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,680
realize that

37
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,640
uh the only real control i had was the

38
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,159
mobile app

39
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,080
and also the apis were real soft and so

40
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,159
mulesoft was our

41
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,280
platform but there's lots of other

42
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,280
platforms out there

43
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,159
we'll talk about that here shortly so

44
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,439
the reason why uh apis are such a big

45
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,600
deal right now

46
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,199
is that look they've been around for a

47
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,559
very long time

48
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,200
but they're exploding because of what we

49
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,439
could do

50
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,799
uh compared to ten years ago ten years

51
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,119
ago we could not

52
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,000
launch a software as a service type of a

53
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,560
company

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,320
and being able to uh you know do this

55
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,119
for pennies on the dollar this would

56
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,119
have cost

57
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,960
you know almost millions of dollars 10

58
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,719
years ago to do this because we didn't

59
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,039
have software as a service

60
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,320
and now with all the software as a

61
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,720
service companies

62
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,519
they now have all these apis and so if

63
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,920
you have

64
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,280
you know car wash as a service for your

65
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,839
local area

66
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,120
uh that's an idea that you can create a

67
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,200
mobile app to

68
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,319
you have apis that can connect to all

69
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,879
these local

70
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,519
companies and this could be a platform

71
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,560
based on

72
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,440
geography and so there's just so many

73
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,480
as a service type of companies out there

74
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,680
that this is why

75
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,599
apis are just exploding in popularity

76
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,000
because we're able to do things for a

77
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,480
lot

78
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,599
less and at the same time i make a

79
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,000
comment about

80
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,079
being able to launch an enterprise skill

81
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,400
type of organization

82
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,239
essentially in your bedroom which is

83
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,959
pretty incredible

84
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,040
and the reason being is that because now

85
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,239
we're paying a monthly subscription fee

86
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,920
and that could be put into

87
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,080
azure or aws uh so

88
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,399
you know the top vendors in the space uh

89
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,000
for us it was uh the mulesoft.edu

90
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,800
connect it's the cadillac

91
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,680
platform it's the most expensive it's uh

92
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,159
very complicated it takes a lot to

93
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,440
feed and administer and also the skill

94
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:18,079
sets pretty tough to uh get for that

95
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,000
and i would say probably the second most

96
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,040
popular platform is the

97
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,760
google apigee api management platform

98
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,720
that's definitely easier it's more cost

99
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,040
friendly

100
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,319
and then there's uh you know obviously

101
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,280
aws and microsoft has their own flavors

102
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,839
and that

103
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,760
the dell boomi is pretty popular as well

104
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,080
for companies that have a lot of

105
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,079
legacy back-end systems so

106
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,879
as far as um you know when it comes to

107
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,280
testing apis i just wanted to make a

108
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,959
call

109
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,760
out and i'm sure a number of you have

110
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,959
heard this postman is a super popular

111
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,518
tool for

112
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,720
testing out your apis which i'm sure

113
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,319
you're already familiar with

114
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,239
and jenkins is also another very popular

115
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,958
tool for the uh software development

116
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,920
process when it comes to the space

117
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,560
so the reason why i want to talk about

118
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,559
this today

119
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,959
is that from a cyber security

120
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,040
perspective you know we have

121
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,320
we're playing a game of whack-a-mole you

122
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,120
know we have all these

123
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,519
vulnerabilities popping up everywhere uh

124
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,880
it's

125
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,759
uh having a hard on our servers and our

126
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,000
firewalls to our infrastructure there's

127
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,280
all the stuff that we have to secure

128
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,360
but one of the things that we haven't

129
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,320
been focusing with is the

130
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,440
apis and so uh you would be pretty

131
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,599
shocked if you know

132
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,040
uh much about the apis being used in

133
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,120
your company

134
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,400
of how that they're gonna become this

135
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,600
new attack vector

136
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,359
and we're starting to see some uh chinks

137
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,080
in the armor on this here

138
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,360
and so uh one of the things that most

139
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,039
notably was

140
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,600
back in 2020 was starbucks and

141
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,040
there was a situation that it was an

142
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,800
external api

143
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,520
but it proxy back into the organization

144
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,680
and the person who was testing this was

145
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,320
able to look at the file path and

146
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,360
trace it back to the back end system and

147
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,000
they had uh

148
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,919
prevented 100 million customer accounts

149
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,080
for being exposed and so

150
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,960
this was the close call for starbucks

151
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,199
but

152
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,159
this is the thing that we're starting to

153
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,639
see is uh

154
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,600
apis are starting to get attacked more

155
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,280
frequently

156
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:32,639
and so it's a very different

157
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,479
uh mindset of looking at apis because

158
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,400
we're so used to

159
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,880
looking at traditional cyber security

160
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,479
controls that apis are now this

161
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,880
whole new category of uh

162
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,719
things that have to be looked at because

163
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,320
there's so much complexity to

164
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,800
an api and the reason why

165
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,400
is because software as a service is just

166
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,800
igniting this business

167
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,198
and so that's why our conventional

168
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,240
layers of cyber security

169
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,720
aren't capable of protecting against api

170
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,720
attacks

171
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,960
so uh when we look at uh you know why

172
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,280
uh we're not able to see uh you know

173
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,560
what's going on with the apis is because

174
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,840
apis look like legitimate traffic and so

175
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,880
you know most cases you know it's uh

176
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,318
regular uh

177
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,680
https type of traffic that's going

178
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,080
through your firewall

179
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,919
i'm sure the firewall can do stable uh

180
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,359
packing inspection and

181
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,479
traffic but it really can't uh stop a

182
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,440
lot of the things that's

183
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,919
actually moving through that api and

184
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,199
that's where we have a number of issues

185
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:44,240
uh ranging from authentication issues to

186
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:47,120
uh you know also data leakage as well

187
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,319
and so this is how a lot of apis are

188
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,400
able to

189
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,240
bypass a lot of our traditional cyber

190
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,039
security controls that we're using today

191
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,759
in enterprises

192
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,719
so one of the most important things for

193
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,599
you to

194
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,400
consider is being able to know where

195
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,639
your

196
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,400
ap numbers are and so it doesn't matter

197
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,039
if you're a big company or a small

198
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,159
company uh your company probably has a

199
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,159
lot of apis

200
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,680
already being used and so there's always

201
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,680
going to be the known ones and

202
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,880
unknown ones and so it's definitely

203
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,160
going to take some

204
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,639
exploratory efforts to be able to get a

205
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,319
handle on the apis because

206
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,800
there's just so many different types of

207
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:30,000
apis used out there

208
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,240
and when you do find the apis it's

209
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,280
really important to make sure that

210
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,440
you're always

211
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,159
having that inventory of the api but

212
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,680
also uh validating what these apis

213
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,319
really do because

214
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,160
apis are evolving and changing they're

215
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,400
very dynamic and so

216
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,840
it may have been meant for this one

217
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,120
particular function but that

218
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,919
functionality starts to expand over time

219
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,759
and so when you start to look at this

220
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,799
you need to start having a catalog

221
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,800
of how is this api been hardened

222
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,000
and so this way you have a good

223
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,759
perspective of

224
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,360
what security measures have been put

225
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,680
into place

226
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,800
uh the other thing too is uh being able

227
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,520
to watch out for

228
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,440
what i call shadow apis one of the

229
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:17,039
things that i discovered in my job

230
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,120
is i started to attend daily stand-up

231
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:23,039
meetings with the development team

232
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:26,800
and i was learning more and more

233
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:29,599
about how there's a lot of

234
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,639
apis being pushed out sometimes on a

235
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,120
daily basis

236
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,959
and they're just coming out too quickly

237
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,120
and then you start to hear well

238
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,199
that doesn't sound right and so this is

239
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,039
when i started to dig deeper

240
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,640
and that's when i started to get uh

241
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,800
additional training because during

242
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,680
attending the real soft api training

243
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,839
classes because there's so much to know

244
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,120
and there's a lot of things that you

245
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,880
have to

246
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,120
really start to peel back the layers

247
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,519
with an api and i'll be doing that here

248
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,519
shortly

249
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,279
now uh as you know just a quick history

250
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,399
of

251
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:07,439
api's rpcs as you know is

252
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:10,640
the oldest and simplest apis soap

253
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,519
is pretty much you know being phased out

254
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,360
uh you know that's a an api standard

255
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,880
that uh hopefully your company is

256
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,560
definitely getting away from

257
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,519
and as you know uh rest api is the most

258
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,560
popular one

259
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:27,519
that gets used from netflix to facebook

260
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,560
and has a certain attributes uh that it

261
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,519
must follow

262
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,479
and also it's uh just the incredible um

263
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:38,000
flexibility

264
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,000
and uh formats that are available for it

265
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,519
now i wanted to highlight uh just kind

266
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,920
of the

267
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,600
you know five different uh actually six

268
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,240
categories of uh where

269
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,640
apis fall into and so this is kind of

270
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,920
looking

271
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,080
from a broader perspective that one api

272
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,519
is not the same as the other and so this

273
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,160
is how you kind of put them in the white

274
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,200
buckets

275
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:02,800
uh so when you do your inventory so

276
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,160
uh from an experienced api uh this is

277
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,640
really about uh

278
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,439
you know something that might be uh for

279
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,519
the

280
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,279
you know let's say it's a web uh

281
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,920
application that they might be

282
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,399
accessing or that it might be a mobile

283
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,399
app

284
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,079
and that will laugh as well as fargo

285
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,560
your mobile devices so you

286
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,079
have experience apis on your mobile app

287
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,839
there

288
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:28,479
process apis is being able to

289
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,600
take data from multiple sources and

290
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,200
being able to

291
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:36,000
combining that data and then system apis

292
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,800
is really actually going to the back end

293
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,399
and retrieving that data so you see that

294
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,920
there's like these three different

295
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,399
layers of uh

296
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,479
apis that how they all work together so

297
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,959
there's not just one api that just goes

298
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,440
all the way

299
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,518
back there's different apis that they

300
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,279
all have to work in conjunction and so

301
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,079
this is the orchestration

302
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,560
portion of it so this is why uh but more

303
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,599
and more

304
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,319
organizations are using some type of api

305
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,120
orchestration engine uh for all these

306
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,760
things to

307
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,640
you know how you get to this front end

308
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,760
to the very back end of systems

309
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:14,560
and so uh the other is uh we have

310
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,079
external apis which is self-explanatory

311
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,399
and this is uh something that you might

312
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,319
expose to uh

313
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,320
you know for other developers if you

314
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,720
want to be sharing a data source and

315
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,839
then

316
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,279
also uh internal apis and that's

317
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,279
typically

318
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,120
something that you know you might have a

319
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,079
micro service and maybe a

320
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,720
back in legacy application and being

321
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,439
able to

322
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,760
pull that data out of that system and

323
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,519
then

324
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,600
also apis with your business partners as

325
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,800
well which is uh

326
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,800
self-explanatory for data sharing

327
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,480
now one thing i do want to talk about

328
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,519
real quick and that is

329
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,320
uh there's no such thing as an

330
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,079
internal api where you don't have to

331
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,680
worry about it and the reason why i

332
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,680
wanted to highlight this here

333
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,800
is that you should treat your internal

334
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,359
network essay for

335
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,120
the internet and i brought up that

336
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,240
starbucks

337
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,600
case uh for a reason because of that

338
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,160
situation about the

339
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,120
100 million customers that almost got

340
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,639
exposed

341
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,399
it didn't happen but unfortunately uh

342
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,079
you know that didn't occur because i

343
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,360
think every one of us called would have

344
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:27,279
been a part of that

345
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:30,320
that we had an external api that proxy

346
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,800
to an internal api and they didn't have

347
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,320
proper measures in place on that so they

348
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,839
worked on the right validation and

349
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
that's how they're able to get them to

350
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,120
work

351
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,079
in apis and so that's why i highlight

352
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,880
this here

353
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,519
is that you have to treat uh your

354
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,720
internal

355
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,200
apis as if they were external apis that

356
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,360
we don't

357
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,560
lower the security bar just because we

358
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,240
think it's on the inside

359
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,160
it doesn't mean that we should lower the

360
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,120
bar on this here that's the whole point

361
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,959
of this uh

362
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:01,360
slide now i want to go over some key

363
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,439
principles uh for you to think about

364
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,440
and that is uh you know the

365
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,079
authentication process is

366
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,760
just absolutely paramount and you're

367
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,560
having to think about traditional type

368
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,560
of attacks

369
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,680
uh you know like you mentioned in the

370
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,760
middle uh

371
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,120
being able to uh make sure that you're

372
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,439
truly authenticating

373
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,040
uh let's say you're on a mobile app

374
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,720
truly the

375
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,639
authentication server and not a

376
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,880
software service that might look like

377
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,839
the authentication server and so that's

378
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,320
why

379
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,880
that kind of leads into the next one

380
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,240
here

381
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,240
and that's being able to make sure

382
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,880
that you're not doing what uh

383
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,760
surprisingly a lot of what companies do

384
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,760
and a lot of companies will actually

385
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,680
card code the client id

386
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:52,800
and the client secret

387
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:57,120
into the mobile app to authenticate

388
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:59,519
and so what this means is that

389
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,480
we did some uh you know stack source

390
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,440
code scans

391
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,320
and we started to see some very long

392
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,480
passwords

393
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,680
and we're trying to figure out the how

394
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,440
and why

395
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,519
and by doing it this way it might speed

396
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,680
up the development process of being able

397
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,680
to roll out an api

398
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,760
but it's uh obviously a horrible

399
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,000
practice and so that's why i want to

400
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,279
talk about using the oauth

401
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,320
2.0 uh and this is the framework that

402
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,199
you actually do

403
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,079
authenticate against an authentication

404
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,479
server by

405
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,120
checking each incoming call for an

406
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,120
access

407
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,639
token which must validate with a

408
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,760
tokenization

409
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,440
server and so with this here you want to

410
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,319
make sure that you don't have any tokens

411
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:47,360
that are not being replayed or expired

412
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,160
and your development team will probably

413
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,560
push back

414
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,639
on this here because it does take a

415
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,319
greater development effort but

416
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,160
it's so paramount because you don't want

417
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,199
to find yourself in a situation where

418
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:03,760
you have developers trying to hard code

419
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,760
client secrets in the mobile app

420
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,000
so one of the other key things uh to

421
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,959
mention is uh you know when we think

422
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,120
about

423
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,880
what we do have an orchestration engine

424
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,600
for uh apis

425
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,920
is thinking about the sample integration

426
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,720
uh

427
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,599
that might uh you know you know because

428
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,480
we want to make

429
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,399
authentication as seamless as possible

430
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,880
uh that we're not having to make

431
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,320
multiple stops for authentication and so

432
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,880
this is being able to use

433
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,839
xaml 4 whether it might be active

434
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,519
directory

435
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:40,320
or ping identity federated

436
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,399
identity so it's really important to try

437
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,800
to create that seamless experience from

438
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,120
the front end to the back end because

439
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,639
uh if you're doing a lot of mobile app

440
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,959
development whether

441
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,800
it's an e-commerce store or a bank as a

442
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,638
service you have all these back-end

443
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,880
software softwares and services

444
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,560
and obviously trying to bring all of

445
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,720
this into unified

446
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,920
authentication experience is really

447
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,000
critical and

448
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,639
having to dedicate to each one of them

449
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,839
for obvious reasons

450
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:12,320
but the other thing uh to watch out for

451
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,920
is uh you would be surprised how many

452
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,920
apis get used

453
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:21,120
for like a mobile app or um

454
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:24,880
it's um what i discovered

455
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,000
is that there are just so many apis that

456
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,279
are being developed

457
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,199
on a weekly basis and even slammed in

458
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,639
that i was pretty taken back by the

459
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,199
number of apis

460
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,399
and it's just so important to make sure

461
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,040
that you're validating

462
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,920
each one of these apis and the other

463
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,639
thing is

464
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,880
also being sure that you definitely sign

465
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:48,399
your level code as well which is another

466
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,800
important process um another thing

467
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,079
is that you know how do you deal with uh

468
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,639
how can i trust the

469
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,000
api on have you know how do we know that

470
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,040
somebody didn't take

471
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,560
uh the mobile app e-compilot and tamper

472
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,439
with the api

473
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,079
and so you can do some type of a

474
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,799
signature

475
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,480
with the api and this is more of a cyber

476
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,918
security technique here

477
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,679
and that's being able to um

478
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,919
essentially you can do some type of

479
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,919
algorithm or a secret code

480
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,760
and by performing this check this is

481
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,640
being able to validate that the

482
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,879
inbound connection uh is being matched

483
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,319
against uh unlisted so this way you know

484
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,360
you could trust

485
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:32,080
that api you know that hasn't been

486
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,240
tampered with so it's a suggestion but

487
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,760
it's a way to enhance the security by

488
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,200
being able to put

489
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:42,720
some kind of an id or a marker on

490
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:46,640
your apis especially your authentication

491
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:50,080
api which is a really important one

492
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:53,200
uh let's see um the other obvious thing

493
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,000
is uh there's still a lot of uh older

494
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,320
web apps

495
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,039
uh this is you see this more on the web

496
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,559
application

497
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,600
server side still using http for uh api

498
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,320
transmissions

499
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,039
and you know that's obviously these

500
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,200
pickings

501
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:10,240
and then you are going to do it please

502
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,360
use at least tls1.2

503
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:18,080
uh for your authentication

504
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:20,240
or your transmission of your api

505
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,280
uh now the other thing i wanted to bring

506
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,240
up is

507
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,960
the use of the load balancers and the

508
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,000
api

509
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:31,440
gateway and so as we know that

510
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
um balancer can go ahead and take

511
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,320
a call on the front end and be able to

512
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,720
propagate it and get it to the hosting

513
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,280
server which might be on the back yet

514
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,919
but the important thing to think about

515
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,559
is that when you're doing that

516
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,280
leveraging some type of a message broker

517
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,600
cue

518
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,960
because let's say you did have some type

519
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,600
of failure

520
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,960
that if that service did fail that you

521
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,600
would be able to

522
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,960
at least cue that message and then when

523
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,879
the service becomes

524
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,160
back online let's say it went down for

525
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,320
five seconds or ten

526
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,760
seconds that it could go ahead and try

527
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,520
to re-run again

528
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,799
and so you have to think about business

529
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,520
continuity

530
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,960
perspective for your apis and how you

531
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,559
can keep the

532
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,559
message integrity with that

533
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:22,720
and let's see the other thing too that

534
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,720
i wanted to highlight that i'm surprised

535
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,160
that hasn't happened yet or at least i

536
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,640
haven't heard of it

537
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,400
and that is uh for a lot of these mobile

538
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,200
apps that do get created

539
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,799
um i started to discover that the

540
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,760
authentication api

541
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:39,039
is probably the most vulnerable uh api

542
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,879
because

543
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,879
if someone wanted to do some type of a

544
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,880
denial of service attack

545
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,400
uh this would prevent the app from

546
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,799
authenticating the user

547
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,400
so if you're able to do that that means

548
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,400
that the mobile app

549
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,679
you're not going to be able to launch

550
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,320
that correctly

551
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,000
and so this is where a load balancer

552
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,960
with proper controls

553
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,039
can be put into place to make sure that

554
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,320
that doesn't happen because

555
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:08,960
as i mentioned previously if

556
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,240
you do have somebody that is actually

557
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,200
hard-coding

558
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:16,159
the client id and the client secret in

559
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,840
the mobile app and it got decompiled

560
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,760
when you make the you know if you're

561
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,918
going to do a dos attack you're going to

562
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,400
be able to look like legitimate traffic

563
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,000
and the

564
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,840
loot balancer isn't going to be able to

565
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,760
really tell that you're a malicious

566
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,959
traffic because you look like legitimate

567
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,960
traffic so

568
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,559
something to think about from a

569
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:37,039
development perspective

570
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,399
uh let's see uh the other thing i wanted

571
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,720
to uh highlight

572
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,600
is uh there's a lot of uh you know i

573
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,720
mentioned about

574
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,158
the three different types of uh primary

575
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,159
apis you know i talked about the

576
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:52,640
experience and process and system apis

577
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,640
one thing that's uh i strongly recommend

578
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,400
is using a different client

579
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:00,320
secret for each api however you might be

580
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,039
getting some pushback from development

581
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,080
and to do

582
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:06,559
and compromise would be to focus on

583
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,678
those three key areas where you have

584
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:12,720
maybe the same claim secret for uh

585
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:15,280
system apis the same client secret for

586
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,799
experience apis and so this way we're

587
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,918
not using the same

588
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,480
client secret uh for all of your apis

589
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,600
because

590
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,240
if you have one api that was exposed

591
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,600
that means they're all exposed and so

592
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,520
something to think about from a

593
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,199
development perspective

594
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,200
and if you're going to do that think

595
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,400
about key rotation as well

596
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,640
that you're going to be changing out

597
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,520
your client keys as well so you need to

598
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,440
think about that

599
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,440
as well from a planning perspective

600
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,440
now as far as some of the tools that you

601
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,158
might find available

602
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,480
in some of you know like wheelsoft or

603
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,919
the

604
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,480
apigee platform and that's being able to

605
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:57,520
use some of the built-in capabilities to

606
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,919
enhance the cyber security

607
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,360
aspects of it so for instance uh being

608
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,919
able to make sure

609
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,840
that a client id uh that you're

610
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,200
expecting matches the client id that

611
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,918
you're expecting on the

612
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,039
receiving side let's say mulesoft for

613
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,720
instance

614
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:16,158
also rate limit is so important because

615
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,840
you don't want to find yourself in a

616
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,559
situation where

617
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,879
uh you're getting too many calls coming

618
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,360
in

619
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,320
because you can go ahead and overwhelm

620
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,678
the api

621
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,760
listener and this way that you need to

622
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,039
appropriately balance uh you know what's

623
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,960
going to be a very busy

624
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,640
api that's going to get hit all the time

625
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,600
versus one that's probably going to get

626
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,919
checked on

627
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,240
maybe every minute or so so this is a

628
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,640
balance so you have to re-limit each one

629
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,080
of your apis and have kind of a strategy

630
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,200
behind that

631
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,320
and also you know sla throttling the

632
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,120
same concept of

633
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,760
rate limiting except uh that you know if

634
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,120
you are

635
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,960
exceeding your thresholds that it just

636
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,559
waits for the next time

637
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,159
so this is something to think about that

638
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,918
you go through some kind of a peak

639
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:05,919
period

640
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:09,200
uh also uh using the oauth

641
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,080
2.0 access token enforcement uh so this

642
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,159
way

643
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,960
this kind of makes it a nice experience

644
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:18,080
that if you have this

645
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,760
token that you could be uh validating

646
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,399
in person if they're going to different

647
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:25,200
parts of your website for instance

648
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:28,799
and then also uh build out and make sure

649
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,799
that you use the ldap version

650
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,158
and then as far as uh there's a few more

651
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,799
things here i want to highlight

652
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,799
being able to

653
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,360
this could be kind of tricky uh it's uh

654
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,720
somewhat effective

655
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,639
uh sometimes you know if you want to

656
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,679
blacklist something you know that uh

657
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,600
you know someone who's trying to

658
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,720
maliciously attack is just gonna switch

659
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,158
the ip so

660
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,240
i think it's really just kind of

661
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,480
short-term thing that helps out

662
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,640
and then also being able to use the uh

663
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,360
json xml thread protection

664
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,640
capabilities to protect the uh the

665
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,559
message itself

666
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:06,480
and also spike control uh because

667
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,000
you might have a situation where maybe

668
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,559
it's a payday

669
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,039
uh and this is happening every two weeks

670
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,720
so

671
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:16,000
you know how long are you going to allow

672
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,480
this spike versus if it was some type of

673
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,279
denial of service so it's important to

674
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,240
understand

675
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,960
what's legit and what's malicious and

676
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,679
then

677
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,679
uh the other aspect is uh with apis if

678
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,799
you want to go ahead and strip away

679
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:33,360
the header injections or

680
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,679
to remove them so this way you're not

681
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,199
divulging information about the resource

682
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:41,600
the server name scripting

683
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,600
versions access control etc

684
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,879
and then finalizing this here

685
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,720
tokenization

686
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,200
surprisingly this is uh meant a little

687
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,960
bit differently and that's being able to

688
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,080
actually

689
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,880
to protect the payload that's within

690
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:01,678
the api so let's say that some of the

691
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,679
api layers were taken down

692
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,600
you know let's say the authentication

693
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,760
wasn't done correctly

694
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,279
and if someone was trying to elicit it

695
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,440
with a wire shark

696
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,880
uh then you still have a way to still

697
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,799
protect the payload

698
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,880
and so this is something that's fairly

699
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,760
new to uh apis

700
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,840
and then also just being able to uh have

701
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,600
some type of uh json web token

702
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,320
validation policy

703
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,959
and that's being able to uh you know

704
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,879
validate

705
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,120
how the signature of the token and

706
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,679
asserts the values of the claims and so

707
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,279
once the user's provided credentials

708
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,360
that they don't have to keep applying

709
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,720
the same credentials over and over again

710
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,399
and that's from a performance

711
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,400
perspective because you don't

712
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,080
have to keep pouring the same

713
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,520
authentication server

714
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,918
over and over again and then

715
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,360
there's uh what's called uh edge

716
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,600
security policies

717
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,399
and this is really kind of think about

718
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,600
uh either

719
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,640
on a browser or on a mobile app and so

720
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,120
for this year

721
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,159
this is being able to uh you know the

722
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,439
first one is really

723
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,799
obvious from dos perspective being able

724
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,880
to whiteness that

725
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,320
let's say you want to limit the country

726
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,760
so that you have people

727
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:18,240
um accessing this from and then also

728
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,240
uh being able to prevent large

729
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,760
messages from trying to be said to over

730
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,039
well

731
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,840
the processing bandwidth for the api as

732
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,960
well

733
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:31,439
and then for the uh the wap aspect

734
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,400
uh this is being able to leverage some

735
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,440
of the existing

736
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,559
owasp core set for checking the requests

737
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,840
and responses to

738
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:43,440
detect some of the basic uh web

739
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:46,320
attacks uh you know it's okay

740
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,520
but it's not going to be a game changer

741
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,279
it's just

742
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:53,600
an additional layer of control

743
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,960
another important thing is to uh monitor

744
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,000
your apis

745
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,880
and so what i mean by that is uh one

746
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,520
you have to understand uh every api is

747
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,440
gonna work

748
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,960
differently so you're gonna have some uh

749
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,279
apis that you have to

750
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,120
understand baseline perspective some are

751
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,520
gonna be very busy some are gonna be

752
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,760
very

753
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,039
lightly used and so you wanna be

754
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,679
monitoring for the

755
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,279
bottlenecks if there's any uh security

756
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,799
settings that might not be working

757
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,360
correctly or if it's

758
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,158
uh dropping high amounts of malicious

759
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,399
traffic

760
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,320
uh making sure that uh the rate reading

761
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,639
policies are working correctly so this

762
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,480
way

763
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,360
you're not in a situation that you're

764
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,919
actually dropping legitimate traffic

765
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,080
because that's when uh if that did

766
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:38,159
happen that makes cyber security

767
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,678
uh look bad and so it's really important

768
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,399
to stay proactive with the

769
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,919
monitoring perspective for your apis and

770
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,799
also just being able to set

771
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,880
uh thresholds and almost whatever

772
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:53,039
certain events

773
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,640
doesn't look normal uh one of the things

774
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,200
i want to highlight real quick just to

775
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,720
give you an

776
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:01,679
experience you know if you think about

777
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,240
a use case this one here is like a

778
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,159
customer

779
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,640
loyalty experience i just kind of want

780
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:09,760
to talk about what do these apis

781
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,640
actually look like and so for the

782
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,480
experience

783
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,559
apis this is whether it would be a

784
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,600
mobile app or a web application like on

785
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,240
the browser

786
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,639
you might be at point-to-sail api in my

787
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,919
shopping api

788
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:26,080
self-registration api shop assistant api

789
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,320
and then if you think about the process

790
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,840
apis that's being able to combine the

791
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:33,520
data's

792
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,840
from sources and moving that data to the

793
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,840
right

794
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:39,439
systems excuse me and that is uh

795
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,080
you know for instance like any uh

796
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,840
registration api order fulfillment or a

797
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,480
sales

798
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:48,399
api and then lastly the system apis you

799
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,200
could think of as uh pulling the

800
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,239
database and that's the customer api

801
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,799
notifications

802
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,840
orders user payment catalog and

803
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,039
recommendations

804
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:02,320
uh api so i want to put some context

805
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:05,520
as to how the apis are being used

806
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,760
within your environment and then

807
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,960
i just wanted to highlight you know what

808
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,679
does

809
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,000
the future of api security look like and

810
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,200
this

811
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,760
here is a screenshot from on railsoft

812
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,799
this

813
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:21,360
function isn't available yet but it's

814
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:24,320
being able to add a layer of

815
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,559
being able to almost like add some dlp

816
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,080
protection within an api

817
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,000
and so this is something that's going to

818
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,840
be forthcoming and so this is something

819
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,720
to think about as well that's another

820
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,520
uh control to think about that you can

821
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,120
leverage

822
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,720
and the reason why that's really

823
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,760
beneficial is

824
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,520
if you have uh you know authentication

825
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,760
api you shouldn't be seeing a social

826
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,399
security number or a birth date

827
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,320
in that api and so this is something to

828
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:52,799
make sure that your apis are working

829
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,200
correctly

830
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,080
and then i wanted to uh provide some

831
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,320
sources here

832
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,520
you know as you know that we have the

833
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,960
obas api security top 10 which is an

834
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,639
excellent resource

835
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,159
some of the companies in this space you

836
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,640
might want to take a look at i'm not

837
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,320
endorsing these companies but

838
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,760
they're pretty popular and it's

839
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,760
something to think about if you want to

840
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,480
kind of take your api strategy to the

841
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,080
next level

842
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,799
i mentioned a few of these companies

843
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:21,039
here and then lastly this was just some

844
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,158
of my references for my presentation

845
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,879
here

846
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,399
so that's my presentation i just wanted

847
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,840
