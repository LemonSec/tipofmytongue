thanks everybody for joining john thanks

23
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,640
for having me very excited to be here

24
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,320
for my very first corn con

25
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,159
i am going to take you through the

26
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,119
covert and the cloud story

27
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,960
um i'm sitting on the discord so if you

28
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,479
have any questions in real time that you

29
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,240
want to shoot out my way

30
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,560
um i'll see them and hopefully answer

31
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,119
them in real time this is very data

32
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,039
driven

33
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,280
so i'll probably show you things that

34
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,040
will evoke some questions like

35
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,720
what is that weird blip right what's

36
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,799
actually going on there

37
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,920
uh i am the director of threat research

38
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,959
at netskope i

39
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,519
am coming at you from philadelphia i

40
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,120
did my phd here at drexel university and

41
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,599
i've been doing malware analysis

42
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,319
anti-tamper cloud security ml

43
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,959
for about 15 years now you've got my

44
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,000

47
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,000
context

48
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,000
of this wonderful conference so i want

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,440
to start with a personal story

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,480
of my pandemic experience um so it's

51
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,200
going to be

52
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,560
a familiar one right i was in santa

53
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,399
clara california

54
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,680
working at netskope which is a growing

55
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,680
startup um

56
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,120
you see a picture of me and hundreds of

57
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,360
my closest friends

58
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,560
standing in close proximity not wearing

59
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,000
masks

60
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,239
enjoying each other's company and

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,720
getting some amazing work done

62
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,480
after the pandemic started we all

63
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,400
started working remotely which means

64
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:15,920
i am back in philadelphia in my hometown

65
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,640
working from a bedroom converted office

66
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,958
and uh you know working with all of my

67
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,238
my

68
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:25,120
colleagues the zoom via slack and

69
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,519
drinking my um homemade iced coffee out

70
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,920
of a mason jar now

71
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,879
and so that's just a little personal

72
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,518
touch to

73
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,480
segway into the first bit of data um

74
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,480
which is

75
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,920
looking at netskope's platform so

76
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,119
everything i'm going to present you

77
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,798
is actual data from our platform and the

78
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,840
first thing we're looking at is just how

79
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,799
remote

80
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,799
were organizations before covid hit and

81
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,879
how remote are they now

82
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,400
and so this little chart looks at the

83
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,599
past 12 months

84
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,439
and um you see pre-covet

85
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,200
and postcode pretty clearly there's a

86
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,079
nice sigmoid there in the middle of the

87
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,119
graph

88
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:06,400
pre-covered you have people

89
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,640
about 25 of people working remotely

90
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,200
this measurement is actually the ratio

91
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,958
of the number of publicly routable ips

92
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,399
that we see users coming from

93
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,238
to the number of users right so the the

94
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,758
more remote people are the more networks

95
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,799
they're coming from the higher this

96
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,440
dispersion is going to be

97
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,919
this fun little sawtooth pattern those

98
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,880
are the ebbs and flows of the work week

99
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,639
those spiky things are typically friday

100
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,040
monday friday monday

101
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,800
those huge spikes those are the holidays

102
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,080
when when more folks than usual are

103
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,160
working remotely

104
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,080
and you know then we've got that big

105
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,000
sigmoid the the interesting thing and

106
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,320
why i wanted to share this picture

107
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,320
is how quickly that happened right we

108
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,560
went from 25

109
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,080
to three quarters of everybody on our

110
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,240
platform working remotely

111
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,120
over the course of a few days so this

112
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,280
was a very

113
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,240
sudden transition and so this whole

114
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,400
presentation

115
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,440
is just going into more details about

116
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,840
what that meant

117
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,440
for security posturate companies and

118
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,400
what that meant for attackers

119
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,120
and what they were doing to to go after

120
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,440
uh those companies

121
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,160
we can break that down by industry um

122
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,759
this is

123
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,680
you know we've had a bunch of speakers

124
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,039
today from a bunch of different

125
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,199
industries right every

126
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,159
every industry is uh affected

127
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,080
differently

128
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,600
and you know for me i'm in an i.t

129
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,599
industry which is right in the middle of

130
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,720
this graph pre-cove at iit on average

131
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,840
was about 40

132
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,360
remote um afterwards it's about 75

133
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,039
remote and you can see there's

134
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,240
industries that are less remote like

135
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,560
energy and healthcare

136
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,680
both before and after covet and

137
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,240
industries that are

138
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,800
much more remote and distributed like

139
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,800
real estate

140
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,800
and so that's why we've labeled kovid 19

141
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,440
as the leader

142
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,000
in digital transformation and what i

143
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,479
want to talk

144
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,840
now is you know more details on what's

145
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,840
actually going from a

146
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,679
security standpoint with that digital

147
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,960
transformation and so that's the

148
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,840
the main topic right security um around

149
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,440
covid

150
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,198
and security around the cloud and so i'm

151
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,440
going to talk about two

152
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,479
distinct topics first i just want to

153
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,960
talk about what

154
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,680
is different in the enterprise we saw

155
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,758
changes

156
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,360
in which apps people are using in the

157
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,840
enterprise particularly

158
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,120
collaboration apps unsurprisingly

159
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,479
skyrocketed

160
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,000
we see we talked earlier today about

161
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,440
personal devices

162
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,680
being used for doing business right

163
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,880
i'm going to talk about company devices

164
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,039
right this laptop

165
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,960
that i'm on that netskope issued me

166
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:42,159
being used for personal reasons right

167
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:45,440
the converse which also brings its um

168
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,280
its unique risks and just in general

169
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,440
an increase in risky behavior we've seen

170
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,198
across the board

171
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,039
then we'll pivot and i want to talk a

172
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,360
little bit about cyber criminals

173
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,639
um two two things i'll highlight there

174
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,199
is their efforts to

175
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,080
capitalize on the crisis which we all

176
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,919
saw coming

177
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,359
and then some of the more interesting

178
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,039
stuff that's happened ever since at

179
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,360
least i think it's more interesting

180
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,919
um more of the evolution right more more

181
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,240
of how attackers are trying to evolve

182
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,840
to get into enterprises right as

183
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,639
enterprises also

184
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,520
evolve to adapt and depending on how

185
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,400
much time

186
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,400
i might finish up with some some of the

187
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,479
response and and predictions i have for

188
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,198
the future

189
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,159
some notes about the data analysis that

190
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,360
i'm going to share

191
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,960
so netskope sells a secure web gateway

192
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,840
that we call a next-gen secure web

193
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,919
gateway

194
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,359
we call it next gen because it's both a

195
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,318
secure web gateway

196
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,360
and a casby which means that we see both

197
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,080
the web traffic

198
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,160
and the cloud app traffic and we do a

199
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,359
lot of work on the cloud app traffic to

200
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,000
figure out what it is

201
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,720
so for example i not only know that a

202
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,840
user

203
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,360
is in google drive i know that they're

204
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,960
editing a document or i know that

205
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,840
they're sharing a document with somebody

206
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,359
or i know that they're

207
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,960
sending a message on slack or

208
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,919
downloading a file from slack

209
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,440
so we have that level of like action

210
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,039
granularity

211
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,280
all the data we're looking at in my

212
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,199
team's anonymized it's for a

213
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,960
subset of the customers so this isn't

214
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,960
for all of netscope customers

215
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,479
but just for the ones that gave us prior

216
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,198
authorization to do this kind of

217
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,000
research

218
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,440
so in total uh the it's about a thousand

219
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,240
organizations that the

220
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,879
data i'm going to discuss covers it's

221
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,840
about

222
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,240
800 000 users and the vast majority of

223
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,520
them

224
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,520
are in north america

225
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,200
and so we begin with covet and the

226
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,680
enterprise

227
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,719
i have lots of data so i hope i hope you

228
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,399
love charts

229
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,000
i'm going to start with the

230
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,800
collaboration apps

231
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,800
so this is just if from a high level

232
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,680
right the amount of activity we saw

233
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,680
in collaboration apps over the past year

234
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,640
you see it's kind of on a gradual rise

235
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,839
right it's kind of

236
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,560
rising before govid govid hits huge rise

237
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,040
kind of still rising after kovid and

238
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,239
these

239
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,160
rankings excellent high medium these are

240
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,480
rankings that we do on the security

241
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,120
posture of the apps themselves

242
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,240
and so what this shows is that the apps

243
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,720
that people are using

244
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,600
are generally ones we consider excellent

245
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,080
or high

246
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,360
in terms of security posture meaning

247
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,959
apps that are great to use for the

248
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,279
enterprise right there's no problem with

249
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,719
the

250
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,399
app itself right there might be a

251
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,880
problem with how you're using the app

252
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,160
but not with the app itself um there are

253
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,480
some things that we call

254
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,719
poor and low and you do see in the

255
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,720
pre-cover days very little red in this

256
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,360
graph right but then postgovid

257
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,080
you know as as um people try to pick up

258
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,399
you know whatever

259
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,399
apps they need to to get their jobs done

260
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,680
or or to do whatever else they're doing

261
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,160
with their computers which we'll get

262
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,079
into

263
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,600
you know maybe making some bad choices

264
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,360
in terms of the apps that are being used

265
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,200
i'll take a step back because i just did

266
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,880
something crazy right i showed you

267
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,360
i showed you a graph with really no

268
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,519
y-axis labels and it just says activity

269
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,440
so i want to define what activity means

270
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,080
and explain why i didn't put numbers on

271
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,959
there

272
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,480
um so activity i'm going to use the same

273
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,479
word to describe two things

274
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,399
if i'm talking about cloud apps i'm

275
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,279
talking about like the number of actions

276
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,079
performed

277
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,040
so that'll be uploads downloads messages

278
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,519
sent in slack

279
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,199
so just the total number of interactions

280
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,800
that we're seeing with that cloud app

281
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,200
and we normalize that by the total

282
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,279
number of users on our platform

283
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,240
on the website side its number of visits

284
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,560
to a website

285
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,399
also divided by the number of users so

286
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,359
the idea here is that it's normalized by

287
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,720
number of users

288
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,480
that's why i'm not showing the numbers

289
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,920
because the numbers would be weird right

290
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,920
they're they're very small numbers

291
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,880
going back to the collaboration apps uh

292
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,399
this is looking

293
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,760
pretty much at that same graph right if

294
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,880
you look at this graph and you look at

295
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,360
this graph now

296
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,880
almost the same shape and all i did was

297
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,680
keep three apps and throw the rest of

298
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,240
them away

299
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,040
i kept sharepoint slack and microsoft

300
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,000
teams

301
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,360
and so they these are three of the most

302
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,720
popular apps but also tell an

303
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,800
interesting story right

304
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,800
sharepoint completely unaffected right

305
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,959
if an org adopted sharepoint

306
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,160
users were using it before users were

307
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,880
using it after

308
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,839
no change slack on the other hand right

309
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,160
definitely used in

310
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,760
enterprises before but covet 19 hits

311
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,680
nobody's in the office right everybody's

312
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,920
talking to each other on slack

313
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,279
and then maybe you know microsoft comes

314
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,800
in and says hey i need some of that

315
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,320
business let's get those sales people

316
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,839
out there selling teams

317
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,440
um you know they're already using

318
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,079
sharepoint right let's get more people

319
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,000
on teams

320
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,680
and so you see teams sort of growing in

321
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,600
popularity over time

322
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,760
while slack decreases in popularity a

323
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,480
little bit so the distribution of the

324
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,959
apps is

325
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,399
balancing out but that level has stayed

326
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,518
about the same we were at that same

327
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,200
activity level

328
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,279
and that activity level is about twice

329
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,959
as much activity per user

330
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,959
than we saw pre-covered

331
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,240
so let's look at web usage right that

332
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,959
was about

333
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,399
apps and again collaboration apps are

334
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,239
the ones we saw the most

335
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:02,160
increase so on the web usage side

336
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,160
um we again i just picked some

337
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,719
categories of websites that people are

338
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,319
visiting

339
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,760
and i picked the ones that are personal

340
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,800
websites right things that people are

341
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,639
most likely

342
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,839
not visiting because of work but

343
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,399
visiting because they're trying to

344
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,440
unwind

345
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,279
right and the the biggest one here is

346
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,079
the streaming and downloadable video

347
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,880
right people going to use services like

348
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,199
netflix

349
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,279
people were doing it all along right um

350
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,320
youtube netflix all those services

351
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,639
but then after covet hit we saw that

352
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,519
uh at least double right on a per user

353
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,600
basis

354
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,680
and we saw all these other categories go

355
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,240
right um consumer shopping websites

356
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,239
right

357
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,839
we're probably all shopping more online

358
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,240
than we ever have in our lives right and

359
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,480
that

360
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,240
that shows in the data here as well um

361
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,160
but i want to double click on other

362
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,839
because you see that band of other up

363
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,160
top and there's some interesting thing

364
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,480
there

365
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,319
right things were getting personal but

366
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,600
at some level we started looking and we

367
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,720
said maybe things are getting a little

368
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,200
too personal

369
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,000
for activities on your work computers

370
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,000
and so this

371
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,480
is just looking at maybe some of the

372
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,880
stuff that's going to generally be

373
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,959
an acceptable use policy violation or

374
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,920
things maybe you don't normally see

375
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,399
happening on people's work laptops um

376
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,160
two

377
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,920
two of the noteworthy categories where

378
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,560
we see huge jumps here right adult

379
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,040
content

380
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,199
other and pornography huge jumps right

381
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,240
we're looking at probably like six

382
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,320
seven x as much traffic uh again

383
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,600
on managed corporate devices going to

384
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,360
adult websites

385
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,760
um but we're seeing other things as well

386
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,040
right um piracy websites peer-to-peer

387
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,439
websites drugs

388
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,599
all sorts of websites that we've we've

389
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,519
as an infosec org

390
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,360
you know community always said these

391
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:43,120
websites are known for hosting

392
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:44,240
risky stuff for example just in the past

393
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,199
two weeks

394
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,320
there was a adult ad network that was

395
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,359
compromised

396
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,199
and was hosting an exploit kit that kind

397
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,760
of stuff happens

398
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:58,800
more frequently there than it does maybe

399
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,800
on the rest of the internet

400
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,000
but sometimes the risks aren't always

401
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,480
where you

402
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,199
think or what you think they are if i

403
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,240
look at our data on our platform

404
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:12,240
from the past year um you know the the

405
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,720
number of malware downloads the number

406
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,639
of risks that we blocked on users trying

407
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,519
to go to adult websites

408
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,760
is not very big right on the other hand

409
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,079
personal websites and blogs

410
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,880
is the category of website where people

411
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,079
are clicking

412
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,399
on and trying to download the

413
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,000
most malicious content more than any

414
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,079
other category of website

415
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
and so you know we're seeing lots of

416
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,880
personal web browsing increase um the

417
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,720
the amount of

418
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,560
increase in personal websites and blogs

419
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,040
was about twice as much browsing per

420
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,160
user

421
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,880
as we saw before the pandemic right and

422
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,800
so this

423
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,079
this translates to increased risk right

424
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,120
there's an increased risk that they're

425
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,199
going to go to

426
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,399
one of these wordpress wordpress blogs

427
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,519
that's compromised

428
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,160
that's hosting a covid19 scam or an

429
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,079
emote

430
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,519
downloader or or something else

431
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,279
malicious so it's not

432
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,079
it's not always the obvious right

433
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,880
sometimes it's the stuff that seems more

434
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,160
more uninteresting where you're going to

435
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,240
end up exposing

436
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,319
yourself to the most risky content

437
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,920
and then my last point here just before

438
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,480
we switch and talk about what's

439
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,199
happening

440
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,120
uh in the cyber crime arena is that

441
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,560
sometimes you can blame all of this bad

442
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,279
stuff on your kids right it's always

443
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,800
nice to say

444
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,480
well it's not my fault it's my kid's

445
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,319
fault and um

446
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,000
we've got a chart to show that that's

447
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,680
happening as well right

448
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,920
this is education apps and i don't have

449
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,239
a breakdown but this is like 90

450
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,560
google classroom and this is the you

451
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,279
know change in the amount of activity we

452
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,279
saw

453
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,600
in the education apps before and after

454
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,839
govid and i cut this graph off

455
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,360
just at the beginning of september but

456
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,920
you see two things right

457
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,360
once covet hits we go to homeschooling

458
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,719
end of the school year

459
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:59,120
lots of activity on google classroom

460
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,920
down a bit in the summer and then this

461
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,680
spike

462
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,560
i mean i cut the graph off but it just

463
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,758
keeps going right we're at like 6x

464
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,000
the pre-covered amount of education apps

465
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,240
being

466
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,839
used in the house and looking at the

467
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,880
activity right it's not the

468
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,800
the parents checking in on their

469
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,880
students right it's the students

470
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,319
actually doing their school work right

471
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,800
so this points to

472
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,399
not only you know did the devices start

473
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,079
getting used for personal reasons

474
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,160
but those work devices are also being

475
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:31,120
handed to the kids and saying

476
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,040
here use my laptop do your homework so a

477
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,600
whole nother realm of risk right because

478
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,880
your

479
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,120
your children in through 12

480
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,720
might not be as security savvy as you

481
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,639
are and certainly didn't go through

482
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,000
all of your cyber security training that

483
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:48,480
your employer made you go through

484
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,600
so three points from my covet and the

485
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,399
enterprise section

486
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,880
huge increase in collaboration apps big

487
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,279
increase

488
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,920
in personal app usage and risky app

489
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,920
usage

490
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,839
risky in the classical sense like people

491
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,800
are going to adult websites that are

492
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,759
known to

493
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,438
host some malicious content but also

494
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,520
because the types of personal websites

495
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,919
they're going to are also exposing them

496
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,720
to more malicious content and then we're

497
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,280
seeing

498
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,959
uh you know managed corporate devices

499
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:19,839
getting shared with other people

500
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,839
within the household

501
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:26,559
all right so now we switch gears and we

502
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:29,840
talk about these cyber criminals

503
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:32,000
so first is just the notion that if

504
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,678
there's a global pandemic

505
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,520
cyber criminals are of course going to

506
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,720
capitalize it right they capitalize on

507
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,120
everything right when the

508
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,000
when the oscar nominees get released

509
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,280
every year

510
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,520
we see people clicking on fishing links

511
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,320
that use the oscar nominees right as

512
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,000
bait for

513
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,520
for people to enter their passwords for

514
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,280
o365 right

515
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,360
so of course if there's something of

516
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,918
major global importance they're going to

517
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:59,120
to try to capitalize on it

518
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,000
what this is graphing is the number of

519
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,959
times that we

520
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,799
blocked somebody from going to a

521
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,840
malicious web page

522
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,520
that contained something coveted 19

523
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,000
pandemic related

524
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,480
and so what's interesting here right is

525
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,200
that we see these little blips right um

526
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,679
you know the pandemic um started around

527
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,200
the end of 2019 so we see some blips of

528
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,240
attackers trying to do

529
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,880
uh trying to get into enterprises we see

530
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,039
it happen

531
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:31,200
early 2020 um the covet 19 pandemic

532
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,600
declaration from the who happens

533
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,960
we don't really see much a change and

534
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,600
then we get into like

535
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,080
april may june and and you know things

536
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,080
just

537
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,399
skyrocket from from where they were

538
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,600
before and and you know it's this is

539
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,799
this is about you know a solid um month

540
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,199
and a half two months

541
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,240
of of people clicking on things right

542
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,080
again

543
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,840
when i'm plotting the data here right

544
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,639
this isn't like we saw

545
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:59,199
more covid related websites in the wild

546
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,720
no this is that we saw users

547
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,799
actually clicking on the links and

548
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,880
actually trying to go to this content

549
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,840
and we intercepted it and blocked them

550
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,320
from getting there

551
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,520
so in other words what happened you know

552
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,159
the attackers knew they had to

553
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,480
capitalize

554
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,840
on it because you saw them start back at

555
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,840
the end of 2019

556
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,240
but it took them a while to get it right

557
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,678
meaning to get the baits to get the

558
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,799
tactics and techniques

559
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,320
down to something that people would

560
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,879
actually start clicking on

561
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,039
and going to you know eventually

562
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,960
organizations catch up right

563
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,120
people become more aware of what's going

564
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,360
on attacks get shut down

565
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,199
so it didn't last forever but we still

566
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,399
have this base that's been pretty

567
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,440
consistent now

568
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:45,600
for the past four or five months of this

569
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:48,240
covid related scams phishing lures

570
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:51,439
uh trojans getting spread to enterprise

571
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,440
users on our platform

572
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,679
the other one the other big change that

573
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,720
we saw

574
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:01,120
um is is i think a little bit more

575
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,840
interesting because it's less obvious

576
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,600
and um when we looked at this data at

577
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,879
first we said well that we we knew that

578
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,639
we were seeing more

579
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,960
malicious documents but were we seeing

580
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,679
that many more malicious documents

581
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,840
so what i'm plotting here is of the

582
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,760
malware downloads that we prevent

583
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,959
what are the types of files that we're

584
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,000
blocking pre

585
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,720
and postcovit and so what you see

586
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,559
is that there's one this first bar

587
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,400
office documents this is microsoft

588
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,520
office documents excel spreadsheets

589
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,880
powerpoints

590
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,960
um word documents where we saw

591
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,880
you know not like oh twice as many as we

592
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,919
saw before or three times as many

593
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,400
no it i mean it's it's about 8x where we

594
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,320
were

595
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,280
in pre-covered levels just in terms of

596
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,439
the number of malicious office documents

597
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,440
that users on our platform are actually

598
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,400
clicking on and trying to download

599
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,400
and what's what's going on here is

600
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:58,240
mostly emoteet's fault

601
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,200
so emote when it recently became active

602
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,000
again

603
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,840
is using microsoft office documents um

604
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,720
heavily obfuscated

605
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,039
um and doing a pretty decent job of

606
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,080
evading signature based av

607
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:15,360
uh with that obfuscation they're using

608
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,760
interesting techniques to share

609
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,479
the initial bait emails they're they're

610
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,679
using

611
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,559
compromised accounts and replying to

612
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,919
actual threads from real people with the

613
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,960
fishing baits to try to

614
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:31,280
entice people to click on them and so

615
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,320
the two of those things combined plus

616
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,240
the fact that they're

617
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,879
also overwhelmingly putting those

618
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,799
payloads those documents to download

619
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,320
in places that they know enterprise

620
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,200
users are used to clicking

621
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,000
the two apps that we've seen most abused

622
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,159
here for for

623
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,919
these microsoft office stocks have been

624
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,480
office 365

625
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:53,280
and box um we've also seen quite a few

626
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,320
on dropbox and google drive right

627
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,399
the the cyber criminals know that

628
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,000
that enterprise users use microsoft

629
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,679
office document formats

630
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,000
they've figured out a way to evade

631
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,240
uh signature-based detection with some

632
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,480
of the new obfuscation techniques

633
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,240
and they figured out a way to deliver it

634
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,640
and so this is you know

635
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,320
recognition that that people might be in

636
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,960
places where there's fewer security

637
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,720
controls

638
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,240
advanced security controls that can

639
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,840
block this kind of stuff

640
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,880
and also they're just more inclined to

641
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,080
click on a office 365 link that comes in

642
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,600
from an email from from

643
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:32,158
a real email attachment so

644
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,678
so my two takeaways here right attackers

645
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,600
cyber criminals are going to always

646
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,520
capitalize on a crisis

647
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,120
they are always trying to evolve with

648
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,000
the enterprise right if they see cloud

649
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,360
adoption

650
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,280
they're going to switch and start

651
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,000
adopting cloud apps as well because they

652
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,918
know people are

653
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
are used to using them just for

654
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,120
comparison i said that we're seeing a

655
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,960
lot of

656
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,399
these malicious office documents spread

657
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,440
through cloud apps

658
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,039
i think it's around 90 of them now that

659
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,480
are coming in through cloud apps

660
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,039
compared to baseline pre-covered we saw

661
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,480
maybe

662
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:07,760
40 tops on a particularly bad month

663
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,080
of cloud-delivered malware um

664
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,480
and so i do have a prediction here this

665
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,039
onsot of office cloud apps

666
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,159
it's still happening it's it started in

667
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,400
late july

668
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,480
and it really hasn't slowed down and i

669
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,840
do expect this is going to continue

670
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,840
for quite a while

671
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,880
and so i'll change gears once more and

672
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,480
talk a little bit about

673
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:36,320
how companies have responded to

674
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:39,919
this shift both in security posture and

675
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:42,158
in attacker techniques

676
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,559
and so first i'll start with just the

677
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:47,039
general security checklist right given

678
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:49,039
given what i'm sharing here today right

679
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,120
what is it that organizations that

680
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,559
that we deal with you know what are the

681
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,158
conversations we're having with them

682
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,678
what are they thinking about and what

683
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,360
are they doing in response

684
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:02,880
um the first is if your business

685
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:05,120
over the course of a few days onboarded

686
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,559
you know tens of thousands of new users

687
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,918
onto a cloud app

688
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:11,200
or certain bus started using new cloud

689
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,000
apps that were that were never used

690
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,760
before

691
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,440
um you know what are those cloud apps do

692
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,200
you know what they are do you have

693
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,720
appropriate monitoring in place

694
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,880
and you have appropriate security

695
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,880
controls around those apps

696
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,159
things like you know if you just started

697
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,440
using

698
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:29,279
office 365 are you preventing users from

699
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,520
just generating public share links

700
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,559
for all of their documents are are you

701
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,158
controlling

702
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,799
who they can share with are you

703
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,159
controlling what outside organizations

704
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,879
can share documents with people

705
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,880
inside your organization um you know the

706
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,559
the questions are always app specific

707
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,400
because every one of these apps

708
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,158
has a different set of controls and you

709
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,200
want to make sure that you're not

710
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,159
exposing your

711
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,960
your data to to data leaks especially

712
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,880
ones

713
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,960
that are your fault because you know one

714
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,600
of your users misconfigured something

715
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,600
or to to um attacks and breaches right

716
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,959
somebody gets into your organization

717
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,799
because they managed to get into

718
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,919
somebody's google drive account and the

719
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,799
google drive account

720
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:11,360
had vpn set up um details in it with

721
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,360
passwords

722
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,039
number two is you know all these laptops

723
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,360
that are now

724
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,559
in the home being used for your kids to

725
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,678
do their homework

726
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:23,120
being used for you to watch netflix and

727
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,799
also being used for work

728
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,080
are they protected and are they

729
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,520
protected against the things we're

730
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,879
seeing right the cloud delivered malware

731
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,240
the web delivered malware

732
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,279
on the different types of malicious

733
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,880
websites the the new phishing

734
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,480
scams that we've been seeing especially

735
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,559
the covid related ones

736
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,799
are they doing a good job against office

737
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,678
documents right is whatever solution you

738
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,960
have in there

739
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,360
was it maybe laser focused on pe files

740
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,279
and

741
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,360
doesn't do as well with office documents

742
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,640
and and now you've got this blind spot

743
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,559
for trojan delivery

744
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,080
you know just taking a look at that

745
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:55,760
making sure the right controls are in

746
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,158
place

747
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,679
and then finally um there's a lot of

748
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,080
gray area here right

749
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,919
i use terms risky uh when we were

750
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,439
talking about people going to certain

751
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,960
categories of websites

752
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,360
so how do you handle that how do you

753
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,600
handle if somebody goes to a website

754
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,520
and it's a risky website do you block

755
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,879
them because if you block them maybe

756
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,240
they're just going to start doing all of

757
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,480
their work on their personal laptop

758
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,240
where you have no visibility in control

759
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,080
what if they're making other choices

760
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,240
that are questionable

761
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,000
what what can you possibly do about that

762
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,600
and so i want to talk a little bit more

763
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,480
about the gray area because we've had

764
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,639
some really

765
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,600
interesting conversations with a few of

766
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,840
our customers

767
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,039
um post covet about how they're handling

768
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,918
the gray area

769
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,559
and they're handling it with a strategy

770
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,600
that we call

771
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:44,158
coaching and this is a

772
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,760
feature we have where you can choose not

773
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,679
to block something

774
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:52,320
but to give the user a pop-up and say

775
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,360
are you sure you want to do that and so

776
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,039
um

777
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,639
basically if there's something in that

778
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,559
gray area our

779
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,000
some of our customers have set up these

780
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:03,600
coaching policies

781
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,840
and what we found in their usage pattern

782
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,080
is that the coaching policies are

783
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,480
working ninety percent of the time

784
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,720
the user says oh yeah you're right i do

785
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,880
not want to do that right i'm going to

786
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,640
i am going to decide that that was a bad

787
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,799
idea and i shouldn't do it that way

788
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,080
and so just some examples of the things

789
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,039
we're coaching uh

790
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,600
about um one of them is you know for in

791
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,559
terms of

792
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,399
app usage when when you've got a modern

793
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,480
enterprise where everybody's using

794
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:32,959
whatever cloud apps they want you know

795
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,600
i'm presenting you this presentation

796
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,320
from my official netscope google drive

797
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,158
account

798
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,320
and in that same browser i'm logged into

799
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,360
four different google drive accounts

800
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,000
that are all personal

801
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,879
right and so if somebody tries uploading

802
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,760
finance's

803
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,559
uh financial information to google drive

804
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,320
um

805
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,600
you know one a few of our customers have

806
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,360
put these um

807
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,799
policies in place that that just give

808
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,639
them a coaching message hey

809
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,158
you're trying to upload a doc it's your

810
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,279
personal google drive are you sure you

811
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,880
wanted to do this

812
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,640
i i think you might not want to because

813
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,039
it's company proprietary information

814
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,640
right

815
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,559
and it's up to them to decide yes or no

816
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,240
whether they continue um

817
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,720
we see the same in in the medical

818
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,520
industry a lot of our our health care

819
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,279
customers put controls in around hipaa

820
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,320
controlled data or hipaa covered data

821
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,240
right um

822
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,240
i don't want people sharing medical

823
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,600
records um with with other folks on

824
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,520
slack right there are

825
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,719
specific places that medical records

826
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,559
could be so

827
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,919
remind the users if they're uploading

828
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,120
something that looks like a medical

829
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,399
record somewhere

830
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,559
you know are you sure you want to do

831
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:34,799
this and then we can do the same for

832
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,760
security threats as well right um it's

833
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,440
not always

834
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,039
malicious and benign right there's a lot

835
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,520
of gray area

836
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,080
and so what do you do with something um

837
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,240
like

838
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:47,199
you decide that something is probably a

839
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,880
scam website based on some heuristics

840
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,000
let them know and let them decide

841
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,000
whether they want to go there

842
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,640
and so i just want to leave you with

843
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,480
three takeaways

844
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,320
working from home risky business right

845
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:04,399
we saw just tons of

846
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:06,320
um risky behavior from uh our customers

847
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,600
users um once they switched to working

848
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,639
from home and

849
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,879
i i predict that a lot of these changes

850
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,679
are going to be permanent a lot of those

851
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,080
apps that

852
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,279
organizations or business units have

853
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,039
chosen to adopt

854
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,480
aren't going to go away when everybody

855
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,919
goes back to the office right so we

856
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,520
really do need to

857
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,279
look at all of them figure out what they

858
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,440
are and make sure we have appropriate

859
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,960
security controls on top of them

860
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,880
and a lot of these behaviors are

861
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,799
probably going to be permanent as well

862
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,399
um you know maybe maybe work from home

863
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,720
is more acceptable now because

864
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,320
organizations can handle it better maybe

865
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,360
you'll see people working from home once

866
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,520
or twice a week

867
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,559
and so these things this risky behavior

868
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,399
you see in the home

869
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,320
you're probably still going to continue

870
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,360
to see once or twice a week and so you

871
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,158
still need to deal

872
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:52,320
with that with that increase in risky

873
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,799
behavior

874
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,879
number two is that the cyber criminals

875
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:59,440
never waste a good crisis right

876
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,960
covet happened they were there it took

877
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,679
them a while to get it right but they

878
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,919
finally started getting lots of um

879
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,440
trojans and phishing emails and other

880
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,360
things through enterprise users where

881
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,360
they started clicking

882
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,879
the you know the other piece here was

883
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,918
that pivot to

884
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,760
um especially with emote use malicious

885
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,559
documents and deliver them through cloud

886
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,799
apps

887
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,720
that because of how persistent it's been

888
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,720
and how successful it's been

889
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,559
i'm expecting we see a lot more of that

890
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,039
and it's not just cloud apps it's going

891
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:31,440
to be other types of files as well

892
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,360
delivered through all sorts of um all

893
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,919
sorts of cloud apps

894
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,120
and then finally is this idea that when

895
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,679
you're in this area

896
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,479
this gray area where you want your

897
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,440
customers

898
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,039
your users to use the you know you want

899
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,039
them to use their laptop the company

900
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,399
controlled laptop you want them to be on

901
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,240
the one where you

902
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:52,080
monitor it you can react if something

903
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,200
goes bad so you have to provide them

904
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,320
some flexibility

905
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,720
or they just go elsewhere and so

906
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,439
we're we expect that this coaching

907
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,600
strategy is

908
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,880
going to increase in popularity block

909
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,399
the known bad

910
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,720
but help out with the um the

911
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:11,279
questionable with the gray area so that

912
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,679
you don't drive your users away

913
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,799
and so with that i left you with my

914
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,960
twitter handle

915
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,240

following up we have one we have one

956
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,879
question it usually happens this way as

957
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,519
soon as we finish we have a question

958
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,960
um any threat from google docs google

959
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,480
sheets

oh yeah of course so i i mean

961
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,559
if you were to ask that question about

962
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,320
any cloud app

963
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:06,399
i would be able to answer in the

964
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,158
affirmative right if it's a cloud app

965
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:11,039
that's popular in the enterprise

966
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:12,559
we see attackers abuse it um i mentioned

967
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:15,440
that office 365

968
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:16,639

we've seen so far

970
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,159
but we see an awful lot of content

971
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:24,000
coming in through um
