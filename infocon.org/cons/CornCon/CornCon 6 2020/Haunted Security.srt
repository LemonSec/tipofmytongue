1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,359
from that i've got some things that have

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,200
bothered me that i think we need to do

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,800
better and that we need to work on

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,519
um and i'm probably as much to blame for

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,240
much of it as

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,960
as anybody else could be right uh i'm

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,199
also

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,000
uh something i'm very proud of and

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,240
relevant

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
to uh this conference i think with all

11
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,479
the marketing you guys have done

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,359
i'm a member of the 501st legion which

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,920
is a

14
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,240
costuming group where we build screen

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,079
accurate costumes and then wear them uh

16
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,000
various places uh raising money for

17
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,160
charity uh so for example

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,760
uh you'll see the pictures there all of

19
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,319
those costumed characters

20
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,920
uh the main ones are me so vader the

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,239
chewie the clone trooper

22
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,800
um and uh him behind me

23
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,480
so uh we have to storm somewhere so

24
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,519
we've got a whole bunch of mannequins

25
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,839
in the office and then we bring them in

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,360
and just set them up uh if you're ever

27
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,199
in jacksonville come on by

28
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,199
uh right we

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,199
we do penetration testing vulnerability

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,240
assessment and that kind of stuff but

31
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:12,080
this talk is not about secure ideas

32
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:15,360
um what it's about is infosec

33
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,039
right and we we talk about

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,200
becoming a member of information

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,400
security or the community or the

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,200
industry or

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,880
or whatever right and um this is

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,520
something i get asked all the time

39
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,199
hey i just got out of college or i just

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,560
got out of high school or i'm

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:36,880
in it or i'm in this job and i want

42
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:40,400
to become a security person

43
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,199
or or we have the the other side of it

44
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,560
is i you know i

45
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,240
i i want to start doing security even if

46
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,880
it's not as a professional

47
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,920
um and that's a that's probably the

48
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,759
wrong word

49
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,439
um but you know there's lots of people

50
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,200
who as

51
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,439
side job or something they just want to

52
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,840
do they'll do bug bounties or what have

53
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,000
you

54
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,880
or yeah we we'll talk about this more in

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,040
a minute

56
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,798
um we have a lot of people who just

57
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,159
think they can just test stuff

58
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,319
because it's on the internet it must be

59
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,599
okay um

60
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:15,440
but there's a lot of hidden traps

61
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,839
and dangers uh both in somebody joining

62
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,720
the field however they decide to join

63
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,200
the community

64
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,000
and for the people who are here already

65
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,799
that are

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,599
supposed to be welcoming and encouraging

67
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,640
others

68
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,079
to get started right because we we we

69
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,079
stand on the

70
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,120
shoulders of the people that come before

71
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,120
us and we

72
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,280
should be the shoulders that other

73
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,560
people stand on

74
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,599
to doing right and i and i think that uh

75
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,800
for me that's one of

76
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,879
the biggest uh

77
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,000
problems that's out there i do see

78
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,560
there's a question uh who's

79
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,680
behind me this is not actually a person

80
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,200
uh it's a mannequin

81
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,120
uh it's a demonian garden from the

82
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,159
return of the jedi um that

83
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,599
me and a few other people built um it is

84
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,359
a wearable costume

85
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,720
um i don't know if i answer that if the

86
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,360
question came before after i talked

87
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,319
about the time

88
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,840
first so uh for those of you who know me

89
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,879
you know that i'm addicted

90
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,599
love obsessed uh with disney

91
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,280
and one of my favorite uh places at

92
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,599
disney is the haunted mansion

93
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,200
um and i've never been to disneyland so

94
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,159
i i understand the haunted mansion there

95
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,599
is just as good

96
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:28,239
or better or worse or whatever um

97
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,119
but the stretching gallery comes from

98
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,400
haunted mansion

99
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,799
and i i think that uh this

100
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,239
talk while it's a gimmick to throw

101
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,760
haunted mansion in it's

102
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,959
also very relevant um when you first

103
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,359
enter the ride um you know you go up and

104
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,760
you

105
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,440
wait in line of course right it's disney

106
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,239
and then um

107
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,879
you enter you enter the mansion and as

108
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,920
you come in

109
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,359
you're brought into a room and the door

110
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,839
is shut

111
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,439
and there's a voice that talks to you

112
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,879
and if you're paying attention

113
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,680
uh you'll realize that the room is

114
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,640
taller and if you look up uh there's

115
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,239
paintings and

116
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,079
there's four of them uh one is a guy

117
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,159
and then like a bowler hat sitting there

118
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,320
there's a woman in like a

119
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,918
ballerina uh outfit holding an umbrella

120
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,639
both of those are on the screen there's

121
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:25,359
an older woman sitting

122
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,919
um and then there's a there's a guy and

123
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,160
then

124
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:33,280
if you really pay attention the room

125
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,639
starts to stretch

126
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,758
and as it stretches the paintings

127
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:43,120
reveal that they're bigger than you see

128
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:46,320
normally when you first broke in and

129
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,320
as you pay attention a little bit more

130
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,159
and watch a little bit more you'll

131
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,080
realize that every one of those

132
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,880
paintings that i just described

133
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:59,840
has a hidden trap or danger uh running

134
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,039
in it right for example the ballerina is

135
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,840
on a tightrope and

136
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,320
there's an alligator uh leaping below

137
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,719
her

138
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,919
uh the guy in the bowler hat is in

139
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,960
quicksand

140
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:14,479
sitting on the shoulder shoulders

141
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,320
of others right

142
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,520
the older woman is sitting on a grave

143
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,560
and

144
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,680
the other guy is got no pants and is

145
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,720
standing on a lit barrel of dynamite or

146
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:31,440
gunpowder right

147
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:34,479
this to me is so

148
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:38,000
much an example of what we are right

149
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:40,240
and for me there's three pieces

150
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,280
that i want to talk about today and that

151
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,639
is the

152
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,638
knowledge necessary to become a security

153
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,160
person to become part of the community

154
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,600
then i want to talk about community what

155
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,880
does that mean what does that mean to

156
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,680
you what does it mean not me

157
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,560
and and we use that term so much and

158
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,600
honestly it's

159
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,199
very very overloaded and then finally i

160
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,000
want to wrap it up by talking a little

161
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,080
bit about the

162
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,720
ethics and morals that we all should be

163
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,719
showing and following

164
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,400
so let's start with knowledge um for me

165
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,120
this is an important one

166
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:20,400
i believe very firmly that it is our

167
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,280
requirement to share what we know with

168
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,840
other people

169
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,318
um we talk about and hear about the

170
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,440
cyber security talent gap or skills

171
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,800
crisis or

172
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:33,280
honestly all that crud right

173
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,319
but the reality is there is a knowledge

174
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,159
shortage

175
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,240
and there always will be no matter what

176
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,880
we do and i want to be very clear i'm

177
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,759
biased

178
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,400
my company does training we offer

179
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,720

non-profit charity we give free services

to nonprofit charities so please reach

189
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,800
out to us for that kind of stuff

190
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,919
but but we see this and and one of the

191
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,199
things i see

192
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:12,318
is that as i look at bluntly

193
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,440
competing training companies the cost of

194
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,520
training

195
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,199
is ridiculous i mean i've got a couple

196
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,400
examples here right um and i want to be

197
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,280
very clear many people

198
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,560
know that i used to teach for a very

199
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,599
large training company and

200
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,960
i have been very public about my

201
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:32,719
complaint about the ridiculous cost

202
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,719
they have grown to um but i i really

203
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,080
think i'm i'm that way about them in

204
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,639
particular because

205
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,400
i was part of them and so it bothers me

206
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,599
that that that happened but

207
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,000
they're not unique in this field right

208
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,000
uh not a single one of these courses is

209
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,400
less than four thousand dollars

210
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,039
and and at least one of them is over

211
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,198
seven

212
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,639
thousand dollars and i'm not saying the

213
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,000
course isn't worth

214
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,879
that i don't know what it's worth is to

215
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,599
you

216
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:04,000
i know it's not worth it to me but i

217
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:06,240
think that this is a major problem

218
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,080
and when we talk about learning and

219
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,840
teaching and instructing

220
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,680
uh of course we also talk about

221
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,119
certification we'll get to that when we

222
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,160
get to gatekeeping

223
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,440
right um we

224
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:22,720
have built a bar to entry

225
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:26,479
that for many many people

226
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,639
it is insurmountable i know for me

227
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,400
uh when i started when i decided that i

228
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,200
wanted to get into security

229
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,478
and i you know that's that what i did is

230
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,760
is quite common

231
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:40,800
right you you're in i t

232
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,479
or whatever and you decide that that

233
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,800
security thing looks pretty cool

234
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,399
it looks fun come on let's be clear

235
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,760
right i get to hack stuff

236
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,600
and not go to jail because i have

237
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,760
permission

238
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,800
i'll talk about permission in a minute

239
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,000
right

240
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:59,760
it's fun i love my job

241
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,080
i love what i get to do i i

242
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,439
have a blast and so i decided that's

243
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,640
what i wanted to do i talked to some

244
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,240
people i looked at

245
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,160
uh the company i worked for had a

246
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,200
security team and i talked to some of

247
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,640
the security people

248
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,040
on it and i sat down and i wrote a list

249
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,519
of

250
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,439
10 things i needed to know and i've told

251
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,560
this story many times i'm not a list

252
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,160
person i don't do lists most of the time

253
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,920
but i but i did this time and i sat down

254
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,040
and i wrote 10 things i needed to learn

255
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,839
and i learned one of them and i had a

256
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,519
list of

257
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:33,040
17 things i needed to learn right

258
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,360
and i learned another one and i had a

259
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,399
list of 27 things and then

260
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,120
50 things and then 73 things and 85

261
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,880
things and

262
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:46,760
currently uh almost 20 years later

263
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,839
i have a list of 4 billion 387 million

264
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:52,240
486

265
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:54,480
120 to items

266
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,560
that's made up but it's a pretty damn

267
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,480
long list

268
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,079
and i learn by talking to other people i

269
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,519
learn by exploring i learn

270
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,640
by talking and watching and seeing and

271
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,920
exploring and

272
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:12,000
trying stuff and

273
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:14,479
we only do as well as we can

274
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,440
i am where i am now because other people

275
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,880
have shared

276
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,760
their knowledge with me

277
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,800
and i will bet you that you are where

278
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,720
you are

279
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,640
now because others have shared their

280
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,160
knowledge with you and maybe they shared

281
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,160
it because you paid them

282
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,680
and maybe they shared it because they

283
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,480
wanted to

284
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,839
or a combination of both right this is

285
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,480
why i say is that we

286
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,000
all should be encouraging and helping

287
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,120
and guiding

288
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,360
the next group of people

289
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,560
because look i'm old at least i feel old

290
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:53,519
i turned 47 this year in february

291
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:56,560
um i hurt everywhere

292
00:10:53,519 --> 00:11:00,640
i get up every morning and like man

293
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:03,439
i'm old i'm not going to be in this job

294
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,199
forever god i hope not right can't

295
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,560
imagine being a 90 year old man still

296
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,240
getting up every day and going to the

297
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,680
job

298
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,360
we have to figure out the people who are

299
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,519
going to replace us we have to figure

300
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,640
out and help the people who want to join

301
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,640
this and we have to

302
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,760
guide as many of them as possible we'll

303
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,240
get more into that

304
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,120
when we get into community but one of

305
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,079
the things that i

306
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,200
see quite often and i use a term here

307
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,399
that

308
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,240
that i find relevant

309
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,360
other people can disagree with it we

310
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,360
also throw it around

311
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,760
sometimes when it's not necessarily but

312
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,079
it's gatekeeping

313
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,519
and gatekeeping i think the picture i

314
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,439
have here is

315
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,640
really relevant first off it's the gate

316
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,760
in front of the haunted mansion so it

317
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,360
fits the talk

318
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:52,480
second thank you

319
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:56,399
as with so many other things right

320
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,959
there's a person a little kid

321
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,079
chain across the gate and he's

322
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,839
protecting it

323
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,199
i yeah i know i know i know he's

324
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,160
probably playing

325
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,959
right but this is how i see so many of

326
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,279
the people

327
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:14,880
that are online today immature

328
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:17,680
little children

329
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,320
that don't want others to be where they

330
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,000
are

331
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:25,040
not because where they are is dangerous

332
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,079
but because it undermines their

333
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:31,360
insecurity right i and

334
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,920
i'll be blunt i'm a horribly insecure

335
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,800
person

336
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,279
i am i'm an introvert i'm shy i don't

337
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,560
know

338
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,079
nothing if you knew all the mistakes i

339
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,000
made you probably do

340
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:46,160
right now you don't

341
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,920
but we see these people and they they

342
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,120
hold others back

343
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,439
and and they try to play it off like oh

344
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,440
no

345
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,959
no it's i you know i just i

346
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,639
i don't want to do this i you know i

347
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,680
just i gotta tell them the right thing

348
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,120
i saw it this morning we hired a new

349
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,279
senior consultant

350
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,639
and i can't believe i'm gonna give this

351
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,120
jackal

352
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,079
time in my life but i think it's

353
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,079
important

354
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,079
we hired a new consultant

355
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,600
and they published a challenge we do

356
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,480
have them weekly the latest one went out

357
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,440
today

358
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,920
um and he published a challenge of

359
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,000
what's the vulnerability

360
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,599
and some guy who i am not going to name

361
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,079
but you can go look at twitter and find

362
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,120
him

363
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:36,319
right he decided

364
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:40,160
to make fun of what the challenge was

365
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,920
and you know what i laughed

366
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,839
because he pointed out that we should

367
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,959
have hired a competent

368
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:49,040
security consultant and you know what

369
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,040
your opinion of our consultants is your

370
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,160
job and your right to have whatever

371
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,160
opinion you want

372
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,760
but i will tell you the guy who created

373
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,360
this he's competent

374
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,519
at least i think so that's why i hired

375
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,240
him but i could be wrong

376
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,880
the funny part was the person complained

377
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,839
about

378
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,439
two things about the challenge neither

379
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,920
of which had anything to do with what

380
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,560
really was the challenge they're an

381
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,319
example

382
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:17,760
in a graphic right that's gatekeeping

383
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:21,839
that was somebody who decided that

384
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:24,480
their ability to nitpick

385
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,600
and we won't discuss the accuracy of any

386
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,040
nitpick

387
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:32,160
right but their ability to nitpick their

388
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:36,079
ability to trumpet how smart they are

389
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:38,480
was better and more important

390
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,239
than encouraging and helping let's say

391
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,839
my consultant was wrong let's say my

392
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,800
consultant had done something really

393
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,560
stupid

394
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,800
maybe they have we all do right

395
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,920
instead of blasting them instead of

396
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,920
making fun of them

397
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:57,040
wouldn't the right answer have been hey

398
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:00,959
did you think of this and this and this

399
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:03,040
and i will tell you the truth

400
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,560
my consultant who i'm also not naming

401
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,959
even though it's all public

402
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,160
right he's probably one of the smartest

403
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,479
people i know

404
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,399
his understanding of the underlying

405
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,120
systems he's talking about

406
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,959
blows my mind i have been dealing with

407
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,000
the systems that he is talking about and

408
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,959
working with

409
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,720
for decades and every time i talk to him

410
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:26,319
i learn something new

411
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,800
that's awesome the guy who is a pompous

412
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,959
ass

413
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,000
on twitter and i've been a pompous ass

414
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:33,040
on twitter

415
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,680
right could have learned so much more

416
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,120
by talking to him and maybe have

417
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,599
corrected something

418
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,480
right but instead we decided to gate

419
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,680
keep

420
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,800
and act better i see it in the open

421
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,040
source field

422
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,639
somebody tries to do a contribution and

423
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,560
we bash them

424
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,000
we laugh at them i saw it on twitter

425
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,439
again today

426
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,880
so relevant somebody asked the question

427
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:02,000
if somebody submits a typo fix

428
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,079
right fix a typo in a pull request that

429
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,959
all it does is fixes a typo in

430
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,319
a readme should we call them an open

431
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:12,239
source contributor

432
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:15,600
and my answer is absolutely

433
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:20,000
are they the same level as hd

434
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,000
more writing metasploit no

435
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,519
but do you call a teacher something else

436
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,639
because they've only been teaching for a

437
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,639
year

438
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:34,720
instead of five still a teacher

439
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,399
still a contributor they might not have

440
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,639
contributed what you wanted

441
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:43,920
or enough to meet some imaginary bar

442
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:46,800
that you have but it's exactly that

443
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,839
imaginary in your opinion get out of the

444
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,920
way

445
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,880
let other people help while other people

446
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,880
work

447
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:57,920
because what we are all trying to do

448
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:02,560
or should be trying to do

449
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:05,678
is build a community now a while ago

450
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,799
uh i saw leslie

451
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,640
posted uh a comment about

452
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,559
what does community mean to you and it

453
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,120
actually got me thinking like what does

454
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,678
community mean to me right and there's

455
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,039
lots of

456
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,280
different things and everybody has a

457
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,839
different opinion

458
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,520
and they may have differing opinions in

459
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:29,200
different contexts

460
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:31,440
right by the way this picture is two of

461
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,640
my two daughters and a friend of theirs

462
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,720
at disney

463
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,039
years ago they're they're much older

464
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:41,039
than that now gotta point that out

465
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:42,480
right but uh what i'm talking about here

466
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:46,000
is

467
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:49,600
all of infosec whether you're

468
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,679
a cool elite hacksaw

469
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,159
with a name that we're not allowed to

470
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:57,200
know because you've got a hacker handle

471
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,200
and that's all you go by

472
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,200
to the person who sits in front of a

473
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,320
pane of glass

474
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,760
watching alerts the person who's gone to

475
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,760
every single defcon

476
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,200
that you ever even imagined i know that

477
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,919
doesn't make any sense but let's go with

478
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,840
it

479
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,600
right to the person who's never been to

480
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,120
a conference

481
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,199
to a person that just has a twitter

482
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,159
account that posts stuff that they find

483
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,039
interesting

484
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,559
that is what we mean it's the community

485
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,520
it's every bit of it

486
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,480
right and i understand that in different

487
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,160
aspects

488
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,080
of that community we're going to have

489
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,600
different rules different

490
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:36,879
entry points nurse and sanctuary levels

491
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:40,399
right i don't care what we

492
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:44,240
want to encourage is every

493
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,520
bit of that community because way too

494
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,960
often

495
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:52,080
i see people get shot down i see people

496
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,799
who want to take part who want to

497
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,399
contribute

498
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:58,080
who want to learn and gain from the

499
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,919
community

500
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,678
they have no idea where they need to go

501
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,120
and part of that is because there is no

502
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,400
one place

503
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:11,439
to be part of the community right um i

504
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,360
am now as of a couple weeks ago on the

505
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,760
projects committee at oh wasp

506
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,039
um and we were having a conversation

507
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,039
about how do you

508
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,080
promote projects and i don't mean

509
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,039
advertise

510
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,760
i mean promote them from the varying

511
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,559
levels

512
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,520
of projects incubator to labs to

513
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,280
flagship

514
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,559
right what is the process to promote

515
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,240
them and i

516
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,080
opened up a ticket with oauth this is

517
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,720
before i was on the committee

518
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,559
this fourth committee existed recently

519
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,000
um because it had been disbanded

520
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,918
right i'd opened a ticket for the

521
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,400
samurai project to be promoted because

522
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,000
we're

523
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,840
in the incubator level we've been in the

524
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,600
incubator level since we joined

525
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,360
uh mainly because i'm an idiot and

526
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,080
didn't know there was a promotion

527
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,840
process

528
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,280
um and so i wrote a ticket and asked how

529
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,918
do i promote it and i got the answer

530
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,200
back that

531
00:19:53,919 --> 00:20:00,480
well it happens twice a year

532
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,039
at the global events and as you can

533
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,400
imagine

534
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:06,240
right now during the pandemic

535
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,520
global events aren't happening so how do

536
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,080
we promote people

537
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,200
right so that's one place to be part of

538
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,918
the community

539
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,799
right but where are the others and i'll

540
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,799
tell you that

541
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,400
one of the things that holds a lot of

542
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,639
people back

543
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,080
is that we because we don't know where

544
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,960
to start

545
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:29,520
we don't know where to go to find out

546
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,039
and i don't know about you but many of

547
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,120
the people i know

548
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,679
are embarrassed to ask maybe they're

549
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,600
introverts i know i am i'm shy

550
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,440
right and i have to sing in here about

551
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,080
infosec play dates and what i mean by

552
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,679
that is

553
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,280
i and i found this funny this is an idea

554
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,000
i was talking to my wife

555
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,960
and she laughed at me because i said to

556
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,880
her you know i don't

557
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,480
i really don't know how to make friends

558
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,640
i don't i'm a 47 year old man

559
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,679
i have an identical twin brother um and

560
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,120
growing up

561
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:01,280
i had friends right i guess you know

562
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,320
either people i consider friends like to

563
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,918
believe they liked me

564
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:09,120
too right but most of my childhood

565
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,000
i spent with my brother we were always

566
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,399
together

567
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,880
um people will talk about you know

568
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:18,320
built-in best friend type thing whatever

569
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,360
right but i realized as i looked back at

570
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,799
my childhood

571
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:26,158
which has its issues and i look at my

572
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:28,639
my kids childhoods you know there's a

573
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,000
lot of playdates

574
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,200
back when i was a kid we didn't call

575
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,280
them play dates but we still went over

576
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,120
and hung out people's houses our parents

577
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,720
would drop us off or we would ride our

578
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,840
bikes over right

579
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,360
um and you would hang out um

580
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,879
my daughters do the same thing when they

581
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,918
were younger right

582
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,120
my wife would arrange a day and they

583
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,600
would go to a

584
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,199
park or a playground or somebody's house

585
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,918
or somebody would come to our house

586
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,720
and they would hang out and play and

587
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,000
they were kind of

588
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,320
pushed together to make

589
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,520
friends learn what the other ones were

590
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,240
doing and we don't

591
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,840
do that anymore maybe we should maybe we

592
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,440
should just go on to twitter

593
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,600
and you know like the secret santa

594
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,080
things people do instead

595
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,639
let's arrange infosec play dates we'll

596
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,720
find out

597
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,240
everybody who is in the jacksonville

598
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,679
area and we'll pick somebody's house and

599
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,640
we'll all meet over there and we'll hack

600
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,120
on things together

601
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,640
it will all be new york and uh hack on

602
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,120
things together we'll do infosec play

603
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,480
dates

604
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,959
but the reality is we have to

605
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,000
encourage people to get involved and

606
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,039
know each other and

607
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,240
relate to people because we are

608
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,760
real people and when we talk to people

609
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,240
and this is one of the things i see

610
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,600
um the jackhole i was talking about

611
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,280
earlier

612
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:48,320
i will bet you that that jackhole

613
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:51,760
never considered the fact

614
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:54,399
that he was bad-mouthing and insulting

615
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,039
a real person a person that exists a

616
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,840
person

617
00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:00,640
that has a livelihood a person who had

618
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:04,080
just been hired at a company

619
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,080
that maybe their boss

620
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:10,000
would have reacted badly to that

621
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,440
how do you know that i'm not also a

622
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,080
jackhole

623
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,760
and decide that oh man you know i got

624
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,960
this new consultant and he posted

625
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:21,440
something and you know what it caused

626
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:25,360
some guy to say it was wrong he's fired

627
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,640
right there's impact to what we do

628
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,000
but we also have to remember that

629
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,080
everybody has different opinions i'm

630
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,640
sitting here talking about this jackhole

631
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,199
but he has an opinion i'm insulting his

632
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,679
opinion

633
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,120
mainly because i think he's a jackhole

634
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,080
but

635
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,399
we all have opinions we all should feel

636
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,760
free to express them

637
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,360
now i do want to clarify and i've

638
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,320
clarified this before when i say

639
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,799
opinions

640
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,158
i'm not using the term loosely i mean

641
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:53,600
things that are your opinion

642
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,559
if we present facts and you contain the

643
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:59,199
same opinion

644
00:23:54,559 --> 00:24:02,158
you're just an ignorant okay

645
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,000
it's kind of like the vaccines cause

646
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:07,279
autism and bill gates is chipping

647
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,840
everybody and uh masks are bad those

648
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:12,240
aren't opinions those are ignorance

649
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,199
right i'm talking about opinions of i

650
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,240
like linux

651
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,520
you like windows i'm talking opinions

652
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:22,640
of i think sms

653
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:25,200
as a two-factor or multi-factor thing

654
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,360
is good enough for the vast majority of

655
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,720
people so stop complaining about it

656
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,918
because all you do when you complain

657
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,640
about it and say that people shouldn't

658
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,880
use it

659
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,760
is undermine the ability for us to

660
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,000
encourage people to be more secure

661
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,520
right that's what i mean by opinions but

662
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,279
we also have to recognize that people

663
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,400
communicate differently

664
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:46,159
i don't like getting on phone calls

665
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,240
i'd rather you just text me or email me

666
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,400
your information unless

667
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,400
i actually really know you right and

668
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,120
then i actually prefer

669
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,840
to jump onto a google meet and get on a

670
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,000
video call

671
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,039
and talk and see each other right that's

672
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,799
how i communicate

673
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,240
but not everybody else does some people

674
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,080
would prefer to communicate

675
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,520
by just dumping an email out there and

676
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,399
never dealing with stuff other people

677
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,918
prefer meetings

678
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,919
those people are psychopaths

679
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,080
we have to relate to all of that and try

680
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,880
to help encourage

681
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,799
that and build the community that we

682
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,799
want

683
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,240
which brings us to the last part of what

684
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,279
i wanted to talk about

685
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:28,960
it's actually the most important part

686
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:32,559
there's only one slide ethics

687
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:35,840
please note that i did not say laws

688
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:38,960
i did not say rules

689
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,799
i said ethics this is not something i'm

690
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,120
going to enforce on you

691
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,559
i know my own ethics i know what i'm

692
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,439
willing to do

693
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,639
and i will bet you that many of you

694
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:53,039
probably have

695
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,799
similar ethics to me but not all of you

696
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,200
some of you may think it's okay to do

697
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,400
something that i don't think it's okay

698
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,919
i know a lot of people that think it's

699
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:04,880
okay to lie as long as lying is

700
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,679
helpful little white lie if you heard

701
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,000
that one

702
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,000
right

703
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:14,880
maybe you think it's okay

704
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,879
to perform a test of a website

705
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,080
that you haven't gotten permission to

706
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,960
test

707
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,760
right i see that all the time you know

708
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,000
that

709
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,240
jackhole that i mentioned badmouthing

710
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,840
one of my consultants

711
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,120
yesterday or last few days that person

712
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:36,158
has been

713
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,158
testing secure ideas as websites

714
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,679
doesn't have permission probably doesn't

715
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,840
even think we realize it

716
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,679
right you don't have information to do

717
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,000
that in my mind that's unethical

718
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,120
right other people disagree with me and

719
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,880
that's fine

720
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:55,600
because that is an opinion

721
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,000
my ethics are something that i've grown

722
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,480
with

723
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,200
and built and understand and thought

724
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,640
about i

725
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,440
actually at secure ideas we have long

726
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,080
conversations about whether something

727
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,600
fits

728
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,158
our ethics we talk about what the

729
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:14,480
organizational

730
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:18,840
ethics guidelines are we've worked out

731
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:21,919
what is okay and what isn't to us

732
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,520
and i'd like to believe

733
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,000
that not only do we follow them but

734
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,200
we're seen to follow them that's an

735
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,880
important aspect

736
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,919
if you're the most ethical person in the

737
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:35,840
world but people look at you and say

738
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,840
i don't know about that right

739
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,600
then it doesn't matter how ethical you

740
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:42,639
were we

741
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,639
have to be

742
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:50,559
the example right i did

743
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,918
realize i have a typo it says recognize

744
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,960
that ethics are laws i meant to

745
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,399
recognize that ethics

746
00:27:52,960 --> 00:28:00,320
aren't laws they're not laws i

747
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:02,000
know things i'm willing to do that is un

748
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,039
because they're unlegal that's not even

749
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,799
a real word that are illegal

750
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:12,000
right i think it's okay that if

751
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:14,559
somebody is beating up on somebody

752
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,559
that i should be allowed to jump in and

753
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,240
help defend the person being beaten up

754
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,559
and in many places that's illegal

755
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,320
i believe if you're a self-proclaimed

756
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:24,879
nazi notice i said self-proclaimed not

757
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,840
that just somebody called you a nazi

758
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,200
i'm allowed to punch you in the throat i

759
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,720
know that if i punch you in the throat

760
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,279
i'm gonna get arrested and probably go

761
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,880
to jail

762
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,399
and i'm okay with that if you're a

763
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,480
self-proclaimed nazi

764
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:42,080
right but it's ethical for me

765
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,880
but illegal makes sense we have to

766
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,080
understand

767
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:49,200
and communicate what our ethics

768
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,199
are right we have to share

769
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,960
what we're doing we have to share why

770
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,320
we're doing it

771
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:58,000
i i love when people challenge what i

772
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,200
think is ethical and what is not and we

773
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,799
can talk about it now

774
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,279
when i say challenge i don't mean just

775
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,799
throw crud at the wall i mean let's

776
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:08,080
actually discuss it

777
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:11,440
why do you think that is unethical

778
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,799
why do you think that's okay or not or

779
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,600
what have you

780
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:17,760
have those conversations right i would

781
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,840
love to discuss it

782
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,799
but we have to understand and i believe

783
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,520
as an industry

784
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,840
we have to have at least somewhat an

785
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,840
ethical

786
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,320
formula for what we do and don't do i

787
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,120
have a screenshot of the cissp code of

788
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,120
ethics not

789
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,120
because i think that is the ethical

790
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:39,120
guidelines we should all follow

791
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:42,158
it's just one of the best known

792
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:45,520
ethical codes in

793
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:47,760
infosec right uh best known as in

794
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,799
actually documented actually published

795
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,720
actually

796
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,840
heck you gotta agree to it before you

797
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,679
can take the test

798
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:58,799
right but it's out there

799
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:02,480
we have to work on this we

800
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:07,600
as an industry have to get better

801
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:10,320
we as an industry have to work together

802
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,879
to fix the things that we've broken to

803
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,039
fix

804
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,919
the problems and gatekeeping that we've

805
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:16,320
enabled

806
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,640
and and please note i'm saying we

807
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,918
because i know for a fact

808
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:24,320
that in my life and i will in the future

809
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:28,080
i will do the wrong thing

810
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:31,439
i will discourage somebody i will

811
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:34,879
cause more problems than i fix

812
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,240
i hope at the end it's the opposite of

813
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,960
that

814
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,320
it's my goal but that's what we have to

815
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,760
do

816
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,360
so i know i only have a couple more

817
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,080
minutes i'd like to open it up for

818
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,678
questions comments things to throw see

819
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,399
it's easy for me to say things to throw

820
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,000
because

821
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:53,199
i'm online now of course i've said that

822
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,880
and somebody will come into the office

823
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,399
from over there and throw stuff at me

824
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,200
because

825
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,199
you told them to

826
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,720
well thank you kevin um yeah there is uh

827
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,158

828
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,600
behind kevin i just they want to know

829
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,960
what's behind you again

830
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,439

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,600
and yes it's wearable and hot as heck

838
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,960
all right if anyone else has any other

839
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,080
questions if you could try to submit

840
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,880

and then the last um but i don't see any

842
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,399
more

843
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:40,320
in the discord channel okay oh

844
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,760
one just popped up let's see what we got

845
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,360
here speaking about

846
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,559
breaking into security i finally broke

847
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,039
in about a year ago and currently

848
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,480
focused on rmf

849
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,480
how would you advise somebody to get

850
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,720
into red teaming the very first question

851
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,000
i have to ask is what is rmf

852
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:58,240
uh sorry i i'm not sure what that is but

853
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,519
how do you get into red teaming um it's

854
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,640
a good question

855
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,880
um there's a lot of different ways to do

856
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,559
it

857
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,320
the way that i prefer to do it is to

858
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,600
start risk management framework thank

859
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,039
you uh

860
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,799
i just moved the other window and saw

861
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:16,000
what she said um

862
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:17,679
so what i recommend is find people who

863
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,120
are already involved in red teaming

864
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:22,559
penetration testing

865
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:25,918
hacking bug bounties stuff like that and

866
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:29,039
one start learning how they do it

867
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:31,039
ask questions um if you're interested in

868
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:34,640
doing it i'll tell you that that

869
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:36,240
uh secure ideas released open source

870
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,480
they're not selling you something

871
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:43,679
we have a six day course that uh in

872
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:45,039
2014 we

873
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,720

874
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:49,679
large organization that i that i

875
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,679

876
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,519

get involved with people uh find
