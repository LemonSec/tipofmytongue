00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,479
we can have a little time for

21
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,920
discussion um the standard

22
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:08,318
disclaimers apply uh thanks very much to

23
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,800
the army cyber institute for uh

24
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,720
letting me do fun conferences like this

25
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,440
but this is my

26
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,840
my analysis my point of view not the us

27
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,760
governments or the department of defense

28
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,440
and the the new standard disclaimers

29
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,959
apply which is that

30
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,720
my son has been running in and out of

31
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,840
the house my dogs are barking and my

32
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,920
neighbors are doing

33
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,280
lawn care so i guess that's just par for

34
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,040
the course here

35
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,480
um quickly what is disinformation

36
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,359
um i think we need to all get on the

37
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,160
same page uh about this up front

38
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,360
and so it's a contested term but at its

39
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,680
most elemental

40
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,879
it's information that's false and that

41
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,640
is deliberately

42
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,239
intended to deceive it is not

43
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,040
misinformation it's not being

44
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,080
misinformed it's disinformation

45
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,040
and for the purposes of uh this brief

46
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,720
presentation

47
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,280
we can lump this under the broader

48
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,840
umbrella of russian active measures

49
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,840
things like covert action uh political

50
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,720
warfare

51
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,239
assassination that maybe you've seen

52
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,519
recently with um

53
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,800
or attempts with alexi navalny um

54
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,720
and that sort of thing and i'm

55
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,599
personally most interested

56
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,720
uh in uh disinformation carried out by

57
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,879
intelligence services there's a long

58
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,840
history and as a historian

59
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,640
i just want to quickly ground us uh you

60
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,720
know the uh

61
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,040
the russians didn't didn't uh start

62
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,319
disinformation and influence campaigns

63
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,959
after the interweb was invented

64
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,280
just as a for instance operation denver

65
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,200
also known as operation infection

66
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,519
might be the most famous one and the new

67
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,920
york times put together a brief

68
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,360
uh i don't know a package on it a while

69
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,559
ago

70
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,239
which argued uh falsely that the united

71
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,159
states was responsible for the aids

72
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,159
epidemic that it was made by the u.s

73
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,359
military at fort detrick maryland

74
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:00,159
on and on um another uh perennial

75
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,200
favorite that's actually got some legs

76
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,798
is that cia was raising money by selling

77
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,119
crack cocaine in los

78
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,000
angeles in the 1990s that too is

79
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,280
incorrect

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,480
but nevertheless these things endure now

81
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,079
why is russia doing this there's a

82
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,759
strategic purpose behind

83
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,280
it you know the russians don't wake up

84
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,600
in the morning and say

85
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,039
you know after i um you know after i eat

86
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,400
some goulash i'm gonna

87
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,160
you know start up with the americans

88
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,440
there's a purpose there's a method to

89
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,120
the madness

90
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,680
and there's a couple things that we need

91
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,720
to keep in mind about what motivates all

92
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,720
this

93
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,120
the first thing is that the the russians

94
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,080
want to assert great power status

95
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,360
that is they want to be respected they

96
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,280
want to be included

97
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,040
what would the russians think about that

98
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,960
is something that they would want

99
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,040
to hear uh since in in their view and i

100
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,960
realize that might be a category error

101
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,720
their view but in in the russian

102
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,000
government's viewer in putin's view in

103
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,120
particular

104
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,759
um international politics is a zero-sum

105
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,720
game

106
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,680
uh and so market share right must come

107
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,440
at the expense

108
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,960
of the united states in the west which

109
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,360
i'll sort of use a little bit

110
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,599
interchangeably for a lot of this

111
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,440
it's also to preserve the russian sphere

112
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,600
of influence and keep

113
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,680
us out of their near abroad and keep

114
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,080
nato out of their near abroad

115
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,880
another uh purpose is to protect or

116
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,880
burnish

117
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,400
the image of the putin regime there is a

118
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,919
domestic audience

119
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,039
uh you know i think we in america you

120
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,880
know think that you know we're the

121
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,280
victims of this all the time and you

122
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,240
know that that's not always the case

123
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,320
uh if a big reason why the russians do

124
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,600
this is to compensate for

125
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,639
military shortcomings they can't stand

126
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,639
militarily toe-to-toe with nato

127
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,240
and so they're just not going to and so

128
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,720
far it's working for them so

129
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,759
why would they and it's cheap and so

130
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,160
they can compete with

131
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,800
america and with nato in an area short

132
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,960
of war

133
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,160
that uh some people have called the gray

134
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,198
zone

135
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,120
uh i would commend to you the work of

136
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,240
casey strickland who has

137
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,240
looked at this and there's a good

138
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,440
article on law fair

139
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,440
called why does russia use

140
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,639
disinformation you can go there for

141
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,120
another analysis although i think her

142
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,160
sense

143
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,199
attracts largely with my own so

144
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,880
who are the the new ira it is not the

145
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,960
irish republican army for those

146
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,000
cold warriors uh they are the trolls

147
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,560
from oguino

148
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,240
uh the uh the folks who are working in

149
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,560
saint petersburg russia

150
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,360
in what i understand to be that office

151
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,400
building right

152
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,280
there now what are they doing in that

153
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,239
office building

154
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,960
they've identified at least i'm open to

155
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,240
more

156
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,680
five great cleavages in american society

157
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,520
they tailor it a little bit

158
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,080
uh depending on their targets for

159
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,120
instance for britain or for france or

160
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,880
for germany

161
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,240
and they got to work and they got to

162
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,960
work very effectively

163
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,440
uh and specifically they're interested

164
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,919
in guns and second amendment issues

165
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,120
of veterans issues and the sieve mill

166
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,560
divide

167
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,240
religion immigration and cultural

168
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,360
identity issues you see this

169
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,800
represented a lot in terms of values

170
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,759
race and racism a perennial topic

171
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,800
and the attributes it's long term it's

172
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,360
participatory

173
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,319
it's participatory they want you engaged

174
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,720
it's emotional

175
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,080
a lot of these things are deeply felt uh

176
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,319
they're tribal

177
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,159
and i think this is my own personal view

178
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,639
i think they're clever

179
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,319
so let's check out some russian uh

180
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,120
information operations

181
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,759
specifically the digital varietal via

182
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,039
social

183
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,000
media uh i would argue that a lot of

184
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,280
this started

185
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,960
uh in ukraine um and in the crimea but

186
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,799
for our purposes here

187
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,198
in the united states i think it started

188
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,520
in jade helm 2015

189
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,680
which was essentially a proof of concept

190
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,719
and just to refresh your memory

191
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,680
jade helm was a military exercise uh

192
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,240
conducted by special forces operations

193
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,720
and it was

194
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,440
all over the united states as you can

195
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,560
see

196
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,879
here um and it was largely centered in

197
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,840
texas but it was all over the the

198
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,400
southwest

199
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,479
and it was a large exercise meant to uh

200
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,120
to practice command and control

201
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,120
um this is a map i just uh grabbed off

202
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,160
the internet that's apparently a us army

203
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,440
handout but it looks

204
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,759
right to me um and so

205
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,479
the let me go back to that and so the

206
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,520
argument

207
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:32,319
uh made uh by sort of the alt-right and

208
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,880
amplified by the russians was that uh

209
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,200
was that

210
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,958
the soldiers are deploying under the

211
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,800
guise of an exercise

212
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,000
in the same way that uh that the

213
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,159
russians were always

214
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,440
sort of fearing a nato first strike it

215
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,040
was always going to be under the

216
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,279
you know the soviets it was always going

217
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,199
to be under the guise of an exercise

218
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,800
where you can get your pieces into place

219
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,240
and just say hey you know

220
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:57,519
this isn't harmful uh so um

221
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,320
the uh the internet went nuts and it got

222
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,200
to the point

223
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,560
where the governor of texas actually

224
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,279
said hey we're gonna keep an

225
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,719
eye on these these special forces people

226
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,560
we don't know what they're up to

227
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,320
maybe they're here to take your guns or

228
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,319
round up political dissidents

229
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,680
and it's no good so we're going to keep

230
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,440
an eye on it

231
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,120
um and as as general hayden has said and

232
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,279
i think he's absolutely right here

233
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,880
quote russian bots in the american

234
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,120
alt-right media convinced

235
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,800
many texans that jade helm was an obama

236
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,680
plan to round up

237
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,880
police political dissidents uh

238
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,160
absolutely right

239
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:38,240
um and so the that

240
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,319
that um that lets the russians know

241
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,080
i think that we were really primed for

242
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,399
this and so

243
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:48,800
uh no surprise in 2015 and 2016

244
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,680
as the intelligence community assessment

245
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,880
published

246
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:56,719
in january of 2017 has

247
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,120
argued that the russians did in fact

248
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,160
meddle

249
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,240
and here it is key judgments russian

250
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,360
efforts to influence the 2016 u.s

251
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,040
presidential election

252
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,200
represent the most recent expression of

253
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,880
moscow's long-standing desire to

254
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,079
undermine the u.s led

255
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,560
a liberal uh democratic order

256
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,800
um but these activities demonstrated a

257
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,439
significant escalation and directness

258
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,719
level of activity and scope of effort

259
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,880
compared to previous

260
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,959
operations and of course maybe more

261
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,040
controversially was that it was aimed

262
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,119
at helping uh the president and

263
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,480
denigrating the candidacy of

264
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,560
secretary clinton okay

265
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,800
well then we've got the mueller report

266
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,239
uh finally concluded after several years

267
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,279
in 2019

268
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:45,040
that characterized russian operations uh

269
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,519
in a sweeping and a systemic fashion

270
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,519
um i very much need to uh read all of

271
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,800
this i'm behind as well and frankly i

272
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,880
can't even i don't know how you guys

273
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,040
feel about this but i can't even keep up

274
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,399
with the volume that is coming out at

275
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,399
the moment

276
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,440
well what did the russians do i just

277
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,320
want to give a quick

278
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,160
sample of 2016 and then show how it

279
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,800
evolved to 2020.

280
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,279
uh they hit instagram they hit twitter

281
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,760
they hit

282
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,120
facebook and they're very active and so

283
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,720
on the left you see

284
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,120
uh the american dot veterans campaign

285
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,360
about

286
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,640
veterans issues and on the right we have

287
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,360
a second amendments

288
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,319
uh meme from defend the second again

289
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,120
these are both from st

290
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,320
petersburg and a product of the ira why

291
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,320
do i have a gun

292
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,600
because it's easier for my family to get

293
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,560
me out of jail

294
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,079
uh than out of cemetery so there we had

295
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,119
a little a little hiccup

296
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,239
with the um with the definite article of

297
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,120
cemetery

298
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,040
uh so we can see that the russians don't

299
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,000
always do it perfectly and we'll see how

300
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,120
they've addressed

301
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,440
this uh here in a moment i just

302
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,560
i love this meme though um this is the

303
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,760
army of jesus

304
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,839
uh you know there's a there's a

305
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,800
religious uh divide

306
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:59,040
uh in our country and so satan says if i

307
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,599
win clinton wins and jesus says well not

308
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,680
if i

309
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:07,040
can help it there is also a

310
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:10,000
um a coordinated attempt to

311
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,880
suppress the african-american vote uh

312
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,440
and that was done

313
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,920
through something called blacktivist and

314
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,519
so

315
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,519
here you have a picture of a young man

316
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,320
he says i will not vote

317
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,279
uh will you question mark and so we see

318
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,240
a lot of

319
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,120
a lot of attempts to keep um

320
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,639
african-americans

321
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:32,079
from voting now the problem

322
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:34,079
with propaganda is that once it's you

323
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,680
know once it's out of the tube or the

324
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,479
genie is out of the bottle

325
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,839
it's so so hard to put it back in the

326
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,600
bottle uh and so

327
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,040
you know i think it's jonathan jonathan

328
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,600
swift observed

329
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,399
that a lie is already around the world

330
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,480
while while

331
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,600
the truth is still getting its trousers

332
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,800
on and

333
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,200
um and we can see that here in a in a

334
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,479
quick

335
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,360
um graphic from the washington post

336
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,680
which showed

337
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,800
that there was an article uh on on

338
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,680
hillary clinton's

339
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,920
uh health it was misleading and the

340
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,399
number of people that reached online was

341
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,319
eight

342
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,680
million and then there was a piece

343
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,399
debunking it

344
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,800
and that hit thirty thousand uh people

345
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,399
and we can see this time and time again

346
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,399
that you know everyone is interested in

347
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,639
the latest sensational headline and it's

348
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,399
fun to tweet it and share it and

349
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,320
whatever uh and then when the more

350
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,360
prosaic truth comes out you know that's

351
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,399
boring so we just

352
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,519
scroll right past it now what can you do

353
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,920
on the internet

354
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,519
you can talk to americans and that's

355
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,079
what being patriotic

356
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,320
did but being patriotic also learned

357
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,279
that you can mobilize people and that's

358
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,399
wonderful

359
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:45,439
and so uh they held a rally from from

360
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,240
2016 that down with hillary rally in new

361
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,160
york city

362
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,600
they probably could have used the you

363
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,680
know i think a sophomore

364
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,120
um university uh you know political

365
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,839
science student saying that there's no

366
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,360
way that

367
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,639
she was gonna lose new york so they

368
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,320
could have you know maybe gone to a

369
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,199
swing state but whatever the point is

370
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,240
they got people

371
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:04,639
out in new york well that's fine so

372
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,399
everybody gets together and americans

373
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,120
it's almost like the godfather if you

374
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,639
remember the um the mario puzo

375
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,480
godfather with the little little

376
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,399
marionettes and they're just sort of

377
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,199
doing this and having americans

378
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,600
dance to their tune but at least in this

379
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,639
case

380
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,519
they were all down with hillary

381
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,399
in the next example what we'll see is

382
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,000
americans

383
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:31,279
actually confronting each other and so

384
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,519
the heart of texas had a had an event

385
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,480
that they advertised on facebook on may

386
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,480
the 21st

387
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:42,240
2016 12 p.m stop the islamization

388
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,639
of texas and they were going to hold it

389
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,600
outside of the islamic dawah center on

390
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,639
201

391
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,880
travis street in houston texas a lot of

392
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:54,720
people interested a lot of people going

393
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,240
okay great well turns out the united

394
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,360
muslims of america

395
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,399
i hasten to add also an ira front

396
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,120
um had a competing rally

397
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,160
save islamic knowledge from may the 21st

398
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,800
at 12 p.m

399
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,199
in houston texas again you'll notice the

400
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,839
same address the islamic dallas center

401
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,040
at 201 travis street now i have to

402
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,519
emphasize as well

403
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,639
that the the actual islamic tawa center

404
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:23,040
had no knowledge of any of this

405
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:25,440
whatsoever so what is the results

406
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,480
the result there was old mastercard

407
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,720
commercials

408
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,519
um you know the uh something is you know

409
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,800
200

410
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,120
and then you know but the effect is

411
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,199
priceless uh and so

412
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,399
uh what we have are competing rallies

413
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,839
there outside

414
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,519
of the islamic dollar center so that's

415
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,959
houston and we've got of course the the

416
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,560
save islamic folks

417
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:49,279
um this is the islamic knowledge uh

418
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,518
um demonstration with uh you know kill

419
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:54,560
yourself and nazi type things

420
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,440
uh and then of course the uh the embrace

421
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,758
of love

422
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,800
from the other side as well i said

423
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,160
rhetorically

424
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,040
uh and uh i'm i'm told that there were

425
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,160
actually uh

426
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,560
guns at the event uh because texas is an

427
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,839
open

428
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,518
carry state but each side stayed across

429
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,480
the street from the other and it did not

430
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,399
degenerate

431
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,079
but i'm quite confident that that's what

432
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,320
the russians wanted

433
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,439
again they're controlling american

434
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,720
activity

435
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,959
from thousands of miles away

436
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,720
okay so that's what happened heading

437
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,800
into november

438
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,040
my assessment is that russia has no

439
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,719
intention whatsoever of slowing down

440
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,040
information operations

441
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,000
the tactics have evolved but the

442
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,680
strategy

443
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,920
remains the same and i'll show you the

444
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,399
new tactics here in a moment

445
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,759
as the the [ __ ] the senate select

446
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,079
committee on intelligence

447
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,000
noted quote russian disinformation

448
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,239
efforts may be focused on gathering

449
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,320
information and data points in support

450
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,800
of an active measures campaign

451
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,600
targeted at the 2020 presidential

452
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,959
election

453
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,600
even more than that as it turns out uh

454
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,439
fbi director christopher wray has said

455
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,679
multiple times that

456
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,480
russia represents the most significant

457
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,199
threat

458
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,919
yes we can talk about iran or china or

459
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,959
others

460
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,559
um but russia really is uh

461
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,839
they're they're the biggest threat and

462
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,399
they're the best at it for historical

463
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,240
reasons um

464
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,760
and so you know the fbi has gotten

465
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,839
involved in the cyber security and

466
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,480
infrastructure security agencies got

467
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,879
involved

468
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,559
this just from september the 22nd a

469
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,960
public service announcement

470
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,280
uh issuing uh this announcement to raise

471
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,679
awareness of the potential threat posed

472
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,879
by attempts to spread disinformation

473
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,000
regarding the results of the 2020

474
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,039
elections

475
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,720
foreign actors and cyber criminals and

476
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,240
hold that word foreign we'll come back

477
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,400
to that

478
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,600
uh you know the new york times got in

479
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,160
the game with the story

480
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,799
cia reasserts putin is likely directing

481
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,360
uh

482
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,080
influence efforts to aid trump and

483
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,240
you'll note

484
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,559
here that the website says that the

485
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,039
agency has moderate confidence

486
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,039
in this so you know in intelligence land

487
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:07,360
it's not high confidence but uh that's

488
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:10,480
not half bad either

489
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,799
so okay that's what they want to do well

490
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,960
what to expect when you're expecting

491
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,840
russian election meddling a couple of

492
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,799
things

493
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,120
exaggerated stories of voter suppression

494
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,960
claims of widespread voter fraud and i

495
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,760
think there will be some rare instances

496
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,799
of that

497
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,200
uh but the evidence will then be uh set

498
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,720
out

499
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,480
as as evidence of widespread occurrence

500
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,480
uh there'll be narrative wars about

501
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,960
what's really happening while votes are

502
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,799
counted

503
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,400
we've heard you know a number of times

504
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,000
that you can't just stay up really late

505
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,760
to see how florida goes

506
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,039
uh it's gonna take some time because of

507
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,280
the mail imbalance

508
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,720
uh potentially cyber attacks on state

509
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,960
election infrastructure

510
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,640
but even the claim would do and i think

511
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,480
even a probe would do

512
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,720
even if they're not changing votes

513
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,480
that's good enough for narrative warfare

514
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,880
purposes i think we have to separate

515
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,640
reality from the narrative

516
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,000
uh you know just as a for instance as a

517
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,160
friend of mine said what if russians

518
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,679
just mail some fraudulent ballots in

519
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,919
right i mean they're they're not bad at

520
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,520
forgeries uh and then the system will

521
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,880
then be questioned by the loser well

522
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,840
what does this all amount

523
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,640
to it amounts to a potential widespread

524
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,760
crisis of

525
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,240
legitimacy for the outcome

526
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,440
now some other tactics that i promised

527
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,480
you on the left

528
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,559
we have peace data the ira

529
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,640
instead of putting out their own content

530
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,320
what they realized is that americans and

531
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,960
brits and other native

532
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,639
english speakers are more than happy to

533
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,480
have their own personal political

534
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,280
opinions trotted out as

535
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,080
news and journalism so here look on the

536
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,480
bottom

537
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,199
uh you know the uh we've got lots of

538
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,400
good stuff

539
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,840
about um the us so looking at the bottom

540
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,559
right here some this is just a

541
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,000
a screenshot i took the us policy if

542
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,320
interference is fueling

543
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,400
tensions in europe over funding of the

544
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,159
us military is driving climate change

545
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,880
and white supremacist culture of war

546
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,760
crimes

547
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,159
systemic racism on and on so these are

548
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,559
real

549
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,320
people um all the the russians don't

550
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,639
have to put out the content they just

551
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,280
have to set up the platform set up the

552
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,919
the i don't know the you know the the

553
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,520
the

554
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,159
the mouse trap and the americans will

555
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,799
put the cheese in there themselves

556
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,280
well then it turns out a couple days ago

557
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:23,440
from

558
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:25,158
the right the the n-a-e-b-c

559
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,559
the newsroom for american and

560
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:29,200
european-based

561
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,360
citizens which is doing on the right

562
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,799
what peace data was doing i mean i

563
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,840
should really say the far right

564
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:37,679
and then peace data on the far left

565
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,678
look at the masthead there's a war on

566
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,559
citizens a war on heritage

567
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,799
war on family a war on faith a war on

568
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,520
law and of course our perennial favorite

569
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,720
media

570
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,559
bias and so if you look at the bottom

571
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,760
what they're trying to do is they're

572
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:55,039
trying to invite

573
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,760
real people to quote contribute to our

574
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,760
mission

575
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,360
to feed the tribe to drive that

576
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:03,360
polarization

577
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,959
uh you can look here on the right hand

578
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,559
side um

579
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,559
and you can look at some of the i mean

580
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,918
this i just grabbed this this morning

581
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:15,120
uh you know and the the the stories that

582
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,080
are uh that are going again very much uh

583
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,320
you know against

584
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,280
uh vice president biden very much

585
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,720
against

586
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,600
uh the the left um one of the site

587
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,120
contributors said

588
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,879
quote a young and vibrant nascent

589
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,520
european organization that'll be

590
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,440
offering up

591
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,918
fighting words against the degenerate

592
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,720
left stateside and on the continent

593
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,799
all in furtherance of our values again

594
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,919
we hear that all the time

595
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:42,320
well let's not overplay the russians

596
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,600
i love to study the russians you know i

597
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,399
love to hate russian

598
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,199
efforts here but the truth of the matter

599
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,400
is that

600
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,360
we do it to ourselves and the russians

601
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,840
are just helping

602
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,479
us along the way right they're they're

603
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,399
not

604
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,760
making us fight they're just giving us

605
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,039
the clubs

606
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:04,760
that we use to to politically uh

607
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:08,480
beat our our political opponents and so

608
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:11,520
disinformation endures even without

609
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,760
russian malign interference because my

610
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,600
view is that as a society we've started

611
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,240
to treat information

612
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,039
we started to to assign value to it

613
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,200
whether or not

614
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:24,080
it accords with our political views and

615
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,240
to what we can do with it

616
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,320
versus whether or not it's true so

617
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,080
here's just one example i grabbed

618
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,480
um actually from a from a family

619
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,199
member's internet page

620
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,760
or a social media page that's got ivanka

621
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,159
trump's

622
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,280
uh footwear and it says made in china

623
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,320
tariff exempt

624
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,039
well that's a real box uh but it was

625
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,320
from

626
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:49,200
uh her shoe company is now defunct

627
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,600
um and was defunct even before the trade

628
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,360
war

629
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,799
with china but someone of course

630
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,678
misspelling tariff

631
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,840
uh tried to argue that the president had

632
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,720
some sort of you know secret deal

633
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,000
um for his own family that were exempt

634
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,320
from the tariffs

635
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,520
not true and more importantly for the

636
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,200
purposes here

637
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:12,400
not russian all all-american uh

638
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:15,120
and it's not just anyone that's doing it

639
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,400
here is paul gossar who is a republican

640
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,600
of arizona

641
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,200
who tweeted out this in early january

642
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,240
2020 the picture of

643
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,480
president obama uh shaking hands with

644
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,240
president rouhani of iran

645
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,080
the bet the world is a better place

646
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,080
without these guys in power

647
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,480
he tweets right the russians don't

648
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,360
control his account

649
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,039
and so here's the problem with it it was

650
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,799
photoshopped it is a

651
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,960
i don't know if it's a deep fake it's

652
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,840
probably a cheap fake you can see how

653
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,120
it's actually

654
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:50,080
uh uh president obama shaking hands

655
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,879
with presidents uh so with the the prime

656
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,039
minister of

657
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,360
india and you can see the indian flag

658
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,720
with the orange in the back that instead

659
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,760
was photoshopped

660
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,520
to green and so did we learn

661
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,080
from the russians that influence

662
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,879
operations can be effective

663
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,799
i'm afraid that we might and so how do

664
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,279
we deal with this in terms of a

665
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:13,200
policy response when we're doing it to

666
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:16,240
ourselves

667
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,880
well at least in the case of russia we

668
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,440
are not

669
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,080
helpless you can see uh president putin

670
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,960
there

671
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,960
number 11 skating in on the on the

672
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,720
goalie there i think he scored 11 goals

673
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,640
in that game and the defenseman

674
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,559
is certainly not going to challenge him

675
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,600
for the puck so those guys have to let

676
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,559
putin win

677
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,918
we do not and there are tons of things

678
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,399
that we can do

679
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,400
tech companies have stepped up their

680
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,880
game it's opened a debate about whether

681
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,840
or not

682
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,400
they need to do more uh but facebook now

683
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,959
offers tools to see if users got taken

684
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,480
in

685
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,559
by the ira there are

686
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,799
entities for instance this one just one

687
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,120
example is called propa stop and it's

688
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,158
from

689
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,719
estonia and by the way they don't talk

690
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,799
about

691
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,840
cyber security they talk about

692
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,799
information

693
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,439
space security cyber security which is a

694
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,000
whole other

695
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,120
conversation but i think it it it leads

696
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,279
to you know

697
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,678
data and i think we need to to talk more

698
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,600
broadly about information space security

699
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,880
this is a civil effort by the way these

700
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,639
people aren't paid

701
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,240
in estonia these people are doing this

702
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,720
because they believe in it

703
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,600
well if you want a state-based uh

704
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,720
response

705
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,000
to uh to information-based threats go no

706
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,000
farther than

707
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,840
sweden uh where what sweden has the msb

708
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,520
and they uh that's actually it's not an

709
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,080
intelligence service right in the united

710
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,200
states we we let the fbi and sisa do a

711
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,879
lot of this work

712
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,600
and then nsa and others in the

713
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,400
background the swedes

714
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,959
look at societal information security

715
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,520
note

716
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,320
not cyber security societal information

717
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,320
security

718
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,799
and they look at it as a sort of public

719
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,000
health risk the same way that they would

720
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:59,600
look at hazardous

721
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,640
materials or an electromagnetic

722
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,158
threat the what the swedes have done is

723
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,080
they've actually put out

724
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,520
for their policy and i like this a lot

725
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,120
and you'll see why because i'm a

726
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,279
historian in a moment

727
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,199
they put out this uh this article this

728
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,919
little booklet called if crisis or war

729
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,000
comes

730
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,120
uh and every family in sweden gets one

731
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,480
of these like you know

732
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,320
back in the day they used to they used

733
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,279
to send you a phone book uh in this

734
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,279
country

735
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,039
and uh the swedes did this during the

736
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:28,000
cold war uh in case

737
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,799
of uh you know of an actual hot war um

738
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,559
in europe

739
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,000
but and then they they they stopped

740
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,639
after the cold war because what's the

741
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,640
point

742
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,760
well about two years ago they started

743
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,000
sending it out again

744
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,520
important information for the population

745
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,840
of sweden

746
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,600
and so if you look so this is the inside

747
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,439
of it the brochure and if you look on

748
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,320
the left hand side

749
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,919
you will see that there are all kinds of

750
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,399
things that you can do

751
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,600
and page six under emergency

752
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,159
preparedness

753
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,399
uh i mean right at the top there false

754
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,960
information

755
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,880
and so this is what page six looks like

756
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,600
and this is what i think

757
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,080
uh is the most important thing we can do

758
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,240
the best

759
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,320
protection against false information and

760
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,679
hostile propaganda is to critically

761
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,720
appraise the source

762
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:17,039
and they show you how you can do that

763
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,760
uh is this actually there's just a bunch

764
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,520
of questions

765
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,520
that you can ask who put it out is it

766
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,440
trustworthy can you check it

767
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,799
and the thing that strikes me as a

768
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,720
historian

769
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:29,440
is that this is just the historical

770
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,240
method you know it's it's nothing more

771
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,919
than critical analysis of sources this

772
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,559
is what anyone who's taken a history

773
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,840
class

774
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:40,960
should uh should be able to to do

775
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,158
um and so here we've got um media

776
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,399
literacy rates

777
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,000
across europe and so the europeans have

778
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:47,678
said hey we're actually going to going

779
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,520
to address this head-on

780
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,039
with media literacy and this is one

781
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,918
thing that the united states is

782
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:55,840
very late to the party uh to do uh

783
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,840
there's no media literacy in my school

784
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,639
district there's no media literacy for

785
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,120
for my son's school and we don't come

786
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,760
out

787
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,840
you know you know when we're born we we

788
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,120
don't come out you know media savvy

789
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,639
right you know this is one of these

790
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,918
things where you get out of it what you

791
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,799
put into it

792
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,159
and so uh and so i think um the the

793
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,158
historical method

794
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,440
civics and media literacy are going to

795
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,880
do an awful lot

796
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:23,679
to secure our information environments

797
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,159
i will leave you uh with this slide here

798
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,679
um

799
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:29,520
which uh i i actually titled it um

800
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,760
something like the historical method for

801
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,320
national defense or something like that

802
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,879
and the editor of uh of the national

803
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,399
interest

804
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,080
changed it to history of fake news it's

805
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,918
certainly not a history of fake news and

806
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,559
i complained and they said you know

807
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,440
we write the titles and you go away so

808
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,600
that's what it's

809
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,360
called anyway i'm going to stop sharing

810
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,399
my slides now

811
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,080
and go back and hopefully have a little

812
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,959
discussion with you in the time

813
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,960
that remains

814
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:04,320
okay uh chat

815
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:07,440
all right so we have things that are

816
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:10,639
being stolen thank you judah richardson

817
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,480
um where should we go from here is there

818
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,960
is there q a

819
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,720
ah okay i think i see one here why have

820
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,360
we not done more in terms of media

821
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,399
literacy

822
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:23,279
in this country um you know

823
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,158
i don't know the answer to that uh the

824
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,279
um

825
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:28,399
the really you know i guess um the

826
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,640
really uh

827
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,918
you know cynical part of me says well we

828
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,760
don't do it because

829
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,440
everybody is winning right it's like

830
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,440
negative advertising

831
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,760
why doesn't anyone take negative

832
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,120
advertising off the air it's terribly

833
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,120
misleading

834
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,039
um but it works and it works for both

835
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,840
political parties and both political

836
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,200
parties

837
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,320
make the rules and so uh they they know

838
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,440
that this works

839
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,678
for them and so if it works you know why

840
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,000
why change it and it's just you know

841
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,320
it's just not a point of emphasis

842
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,679
and uh and it's it's uh it's really very

843
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:05,120
frustrating

844
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:07,200
um another question is what is the us

845
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,959
doing in social media to offset what

846
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,000
putin is doing here

847
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:15,440
this is a this is a really important

848
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,720
question um and i think that

849
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:24,559
what we are we're doing this um

850
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:27,279
is that uh is that the idea is that

851
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:29,440
the the russians are not in the same

852
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:32,559
miasma of confusion

853
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,520
that that we are um we are a very

854
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,000
uh we're a very i don't gullible's not

855
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,918
the right

856
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,240
word but you know we're a society that

857
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,480
that often believes things that are told

858
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,480
to us right we grew up with dan rather

859
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,880
and i don't know peter jennings or

860
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,919
you know insert your your news anchor

861
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,679
here right you know this

862
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,200
this is the news right the russians

863
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,240
don't have this they didn't grow up with

864
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,559
that they've been

865
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,399
lied to since day one and they have a

866
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,240
much more skeptical approach so

867
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,239
that's number one it might not work

868
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,440
number two is that

869
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,000
i don't know for sure that it accords

870
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,919
with our

871
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:11,360
values um you know do we want to record

872
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:14,159
uh you know do we want to engage in

873
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,479
um you know in this sort of food fight

874
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:20,480
you know with russians or with chinese

875
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,880
or with others um and number three

876
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,919
who's saying that we're not doing it you

877
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,080
know in a uh

878
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,080
in in a number of ways you know i mean

879
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,360
just you know it's it's a matter of

880
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,080
open record that the central

881
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,799
intelligence agency my my old office

882
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,439
um has a uh you know has a covert

883
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,240
influence

884
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,039
uh capability so we can do things

885
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,320
actually and

886
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,320
you know i don't i don't know that we're

887
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,039
taking it laying down

888
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,000
um you know the state department has the

889
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,158
global engagement

890
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,120
center i mean there are things that that

891
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,840
folks uh

892
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,000
are doing and so i think the offense

893
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,279
isn't necessarily the problem i think we

894
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,080
need to focus

895
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:59,440
a lot on the defense at the moment uh

896
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,039
you know but i mean deep down i don't

897
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,640
want to roll over for this you know one

898
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,559
of the things i'd love to do is

899
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,480
start you know blasting putin's you know

900
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:08,559
bank accounts online

901
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,320
but i think you know going back to the

902
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,879
the the 2018

903
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,439
uh election in the fall you'll remember

904
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,240
that

905
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,159
you know uh nsa or cybercom or somebody

906
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,279
took the internet research agency

907
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:23,120
offline for a day or two and that's a

908
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,919
nice show of power but that's not how

909
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,639
information

910
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:29,039
warfare works that would be like you

911
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,440
know having an anti-vaxxer or something

912
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,360
and like

913
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,559
shutting up an anti-vaxxer that's

914
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,719
talking for

915
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:36,240
uh you know for for months on end and

916
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,159
shutting them up for a day

917
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,080
right like you know the message is out

918
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,120
there so i don't think the technical

919
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,240
solution

920
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,120
of shutting them down is uh is gonna

921
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,200
work

922
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,399
okay we've got a lot to do here and not

923
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,519
a lot of time

924
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:53,279
uh was the uh the fake news on 5g

925
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,240
causing sickness also perpetuated by

926
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:57,840
russian trolls

927
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,159
so this is a great question um as far as

928
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,320
i

929
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,039
understand it and you know i didn't show

930
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:05,918
all of my slides but there's um

931
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:07,519
there are efforts by the russians that

932
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,159
are totally overt

933
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,399
and so they pollute our information

934
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:15,039
environment surreptitiously

935
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:16,080
but they also pollute our information

936
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:19,039
environment

937
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,519
uh totally in the open by uh you know

938
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,760
the

939
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,519
the network now called rt formerly

940
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,320
called russia today

941
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,480
and they do it uh via sputnik news and

942
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,080
so they don't have to do things covertly

943
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,600
a lot of times they just they have they

944
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,960
make their own channels and say this is

945
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,840
what we do

946
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,080
um anonymous attendee do we educa how do

947
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,840
we educate the really uneducated

948
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,600
that people just they don't want to use

949
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,720
their judgment you know

950
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,799
it's a great question um it's

951
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,799
it's frustrating for me to see because i

952
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:51,360
see it you know with my own friends

953
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:53,120
and uh and they will share things or

954
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,639
reflexively tweet things

955
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,120
that you know these are people that that

956
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:00,720
might have a phd or an md

957
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,559
or a jd um but they they get ahead of

958
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,720
themselves and so i think what we all

959
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:07,120
need to do is just take a breath

960
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,359
there are some some efforts underway

961
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:13,040
though particularly uh there are

962
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:14,879
some um efforts of public libraries

963
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,719
and i'm always hesitant to point out

964
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:20,000
this research but it turns out

965
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:22,719
that the young people uh i'm i'm a gen

966
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,560
xer myself but the the millennials

967
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,399
uh turns out they're not terrible at

968
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,199
this and they are a little bit media

969
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:30,078
savvy

970
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:32,158
it's actually the baby boomer generation

971
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,720
uh who are on facebook and who are on

972
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,359
twitter

973
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,719
who are the worst offenders uh and so

974
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:39,199
for instance you know there's

975
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:41,279
there are public library efforts uh to

976
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:44,078
try to get these folks as well

977
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,760
okay uh from nick given our constitution

978
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,440
and culture whose responsibility is to

979
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,560
set and enforce policies on media

980
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,560
manipulation

981
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,399
what role if any can the government play

982
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,879
it wouldn't it be contrary to

983
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,598
the law for them to play it uh and can

984
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:59,440
we do something

985
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:01,839
uh republican yeah okay this is a hugely

986
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:05,040
intractable problem

987
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:07,440
problem which is why i enjoy uh

988
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,200
speaking engagements because it's just

989
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,560
it's just fun to talk about this stuff

990
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,160
and it's really important

991
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:15,599
as well i don't know whose

992
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,319
responsibility it is

993
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,040
i i do know that i don't want to make it

994
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,480
the tech

995
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:24,320
company's responsibility because i want

996
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,640
them to be better citizens

997
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,520
and police their you know their content

998
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,560
and all that

999
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:34,240
but i don't want uh i don't want us

1000
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:37,200
to a cross free speech uh guarantees

1001
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,118
a and b i want people to be able to

1002
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,118
think for themselves right i don't want

1003
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,599
the government to protect me

1004
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,280
from lies i don't want the government to

1005
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:48,480
to to protect me

1006
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,160
from from harmful ideas or things that

1007
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,880
might confuse me

1008
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,160
i want to develop the the critical

1009
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,640
thinking muscle

1010
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,480
that's the only way we're going to do it

1011
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,160
if you remember i was always fascinated

1012
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,200
when i was a youngster by national

1013
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,200
geographic

1014
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,799
and there was this tribe in africa that

1015
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,720
had these like um

1016
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,320
these like necklaces right that the

1017
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,480
elevated uh women's

1018
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,599
chins and so their their necks were like

1019
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,480
that long

1020
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:16,320
well the net result of that is if you

1021
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,000
took that necklace off like

1022
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,839
their necks would crack right because

1023
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,119
they they've not developed those

1024
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:25,359
muscles and so i'm very very

1025
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,320
wary about the government getting

1026
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:29,520
involved

1027
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:31,359
uh policing media companies that said

1028
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,759
there are things that can be done

1029
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,400
like the honest ads act which congress

1030
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,640
has not

1031
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,160
acted on and they can act on so there

1032
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,839
are plenty of things that congress can

1033
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,200
do i just saw a headline the other day

1034
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,200
that says that uh

1035
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,040
the the ceo of google and facebook and

1036
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,839
twitter i think are all coming back

1037
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,880
to testify uh in in front of some senate

1038
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:52,240
committee

1039
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:55,040
so you know this is an evolving space

1040
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,399
um i also do uh place some blame at

1041
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,599
media companies

1042
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,599
for the slow conflation over time

1043
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,680
of uh what you might call hard

1044
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,119
journalism or real journalism and

1045
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,160
opinion journalism

1046
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,800
right when does that end um and so now

1047
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,118
we have

1048
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,800
sites like peace data or like this other

1049
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,480
far right site

1050
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,960
they can only get away with that because

1051
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,920
americans have forgotten the difference

1052
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,160
between news

1053
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,320
and opinion this is something that i

1054
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:25,839
play with my son all the time

1055
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:28,079
i i i say a statement and i give him uh

1056
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:29,119
news or and i say is that is that a fact

1057
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,520
or is that an opinion

1058
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,480
and he's seven and so this is what i'm

1059
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,599
trying to do

1060
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,680
in my own house uh to try to address

1061
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:40,320
some of these issues and i hope that

1062
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,440
we can inspire others to do this more

1063
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,520
broadly

1064
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,680
um thank you so much i'm getting the

1065
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:48,560
