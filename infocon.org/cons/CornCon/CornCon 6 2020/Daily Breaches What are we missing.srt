friday and saturday to uh to be at

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,680
corncon my name is brian hurd

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,760
i currently am the chief of office of

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,079
seattle for

25
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,440
strasfreebird some of you may know the

26
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,959
brand may not

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,640
we're the people facebook hired for

28
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,880
cambridge analytica

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,479
as well as a lot of the other breaches

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,560
you read about were usually brought in

31
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,000
under council and were owned by a

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,560
company called aeon an

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,159
international insurance company the

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,720
final thought on that and then we'll get

35
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,720
into

36
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,560
introducing richard in the panel is the

37
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,080
reason i joined an insurance company for

38
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,280
those of you that are new to the cso

39
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,920
community

40
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,119
is because just like seat belts

41
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,159
mid-century

42
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,240
and adjustments to steam boilers around

43
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,799
120 years ago

44
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,920
insurance companies drive architecture

45
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,040
to keep the cost

46
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,439
of problems explosions and crashes down

47
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,680
and they'll be doing the same in cyber

48
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,158
so while for many of us for 30 years we

49
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,000
picked or built our own technologies

50
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,840
soon it will be the insurance companies

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,399
that will have reference architectures

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,320
or technological references because

53
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,840
they're doing longitudinal math

54
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,439
that'll change our field quite a bit

55
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,960
and you'll see the chief legal officers

56
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,398
and chief risk officers potentially

57
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,880
having more inputs

58
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,239
about technology selection so be on the

59
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,000
lookout for that but there are a lot of

60
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,599
great technologies and a lot of great

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,319
best practices

62
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,160
today richard rushing cso of motorota

63
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,480
motorola mobility and i

64
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,280
are going to be doing a back and forth

65
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,679
on

66
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,520
the breaches of today we're going to go

67
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,440
over some areas like

68
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,800
uh just the current threat environment

69
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,120
but a lot of you know it we're just

70
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,560
going to bring some senior looks at that

71
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,480
we're then going to look at kind of the

72
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,519
response team from richard's perspective

73
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,679
internally

74
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,280
and then i often leave what i call the

75
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,720
cyber smoke jumpers

76
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,640
that are called in by some of the

77
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,560
world's largest enterprises

78
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,399
and join that internal team and the

79
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,599
legal team and the outside council

80
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,239
on mega breaches and then we're going to

81
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,799
kind of

82
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,239
finish up with what can be done

83
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,040
interactive is welcome

84
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,480
please do post questions or issues into

85
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,319
the chat as we're going

86
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,920
uh richard and i both have done a couple

87
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,720
of these so we're quite willing to

88
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,440
adjust

89
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,599
for the needs of the audience and follow

90
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,840
where the spirit may lead us

91
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,280
uh over to you richard for an intro and

92
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,360
then i'll queue up a couple questions

93
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,760
about the current threat environment

94
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,640
sure thanks brian uh no it's a pleasure

95
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,239

99
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,480
lots of fun and we've all traveled in uh

100
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,760
relatively the same small circle so it's

101
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,920
good to get together

102
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,120
virtually uh my name is richard russian

103
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,958
i'm cso for

104
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:42,000
motorola mobility i've been cso now

105
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,159
uh going on 14 years uh which

106
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,080
i should have died like five or six

107
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,399
times according to the cso

108
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,200
life expectancy for organizations i seem

109
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,680
to just

110
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,359
keep alive i don't don't read into that

111
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,040
if i'm some small

112
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,799
cockroach or something like that i just

113
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,079
know where bodies are buried

114
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,840
uh for the most part of it um

115
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,519
i've been in technology i've been doing

116
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,239
this pretty much all my life

117
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,760
uh i don't have gray hair yet but i have

118
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,400
a great beard so i think that just kind

119
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,640
of was it

120
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,080
goes to the the stress levels that's why

121
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,760
it's usually shaved

122
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:19,280
uh on that side of it that's there um

123
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,199
i i i do uh love the topics

124
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,479
uh that we're talking about i i think

125
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,160
that's a a

126
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,719
critical area that we see a lot of

127
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,320
organizations

128
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,320
um kind of struggling with and as we've

129
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,840
we've come out in this before where

130
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,520
we've said hey

131
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,719
it's not if but when uh

132
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,680
and i think that's that's very very true

133
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,320
uh and it's no longer if and when it's

134
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,520
kind of like

135
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,400
it's probably going on as we speak uh

136
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,758
in a lot of organizations uh that's

137
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,799
there you saw

138
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,560
uh articles as there are several

139
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,199
conferences around the world going on

140
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,600
where you've had apt groups that have

141
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,039
gone

142
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,919
undetected for nine ten years

143
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,039
uh that are just coming into play you

144
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,440
have

145
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,320
all these different areas where people

146
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,919
were

147
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,919
taking advantage monetizing uh

148
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,680
doing different things to not only

149
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,599
companies and organizations but

150
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,680
everyone's accounts and things around

151
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,479
that nature so i think this is a timely

152
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,720
topic and

153
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,479
i look forward to chatting with

154
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,600
everybody

155
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:32,880
got it thanks richard to set up

156
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,680
uh richard at the at his one position

157
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,479
and i've been in the community since

158
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,919
1993.

159
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,919
for those of you a little younger that

160
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:43,359
was before the 2000s

161
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,960
um so uh i found the program at naval

162
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,759
criminal investigative service so we

163
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,280
were hunting

164
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,440
apts back in the early 90s uh and that's

165
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,400
before the web actually existed it came

166
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,560
into existence around 94.95

167
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,960
but what i will tell you is a lot of the

168
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,360
really good apts have learned how to

169
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,880
stay

170
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,880
resident inside a target for years

171
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,280
slowly stealing and siphoning

172
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,719
information now those are nation state

173
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,599
apts looking to do intelligence

174
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,280
collection

175
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,759
the loud brash russian ransomware people

176
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,198
will not linger for months they will get

177
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,680
in in a period of now

178
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,280
sometimes less than seven days from

179
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,600
first phishing email

180
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,039
to 10 million dollar ransom we've seen

181
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,479
the ransoms

182
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,159
five million dollars and 10 million

183
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,440
dollars are not uncommon

184
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:35,440
i've i've worked cases 21 million and

185
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:38,479
hold your hats 72 million dollar ransom

186
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,440
for a fortune 50 company i personally

187
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,199
believe this is a

188
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,759
becoming and i'm not picking this term

189
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,759
lightly a clear and present danger

190
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,919
so i'm going to queue up uh richard what

191
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,240
we talked about to prep for this was

192
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,479
this

193
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,360
is no longer the perception of mono

194
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:56,400
amano of you of a cso versus

195
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,479
a hacker in fact that term needs to go

196
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,880
away at some point

197
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,400
because this is no longer hackers it is

198
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,960
not hacker groups

199
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,400
it is not even organized crime groups it

200
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,758
is what i personally call

201
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,719
an ecosystem of evil at the trillion

202
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,000
dollar level

203
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,400
this is an economy of

204
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,759
of bad behavior there are whole groups

205
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,120
that just do the fishing

206
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,280
once you're hooked there are whole

207
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,880
groups that do the exploitation

208
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,880
and then they hand you off to another

209
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,479
group or sell you on a market

210
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,120
for the people to do the ransom

211
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,919
negotiations and collections

212
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,240
so richard 14 you're right 14 years in

213
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:37,680
one organization especially

214
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,039
when mobile communications are a target

215
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,800
of every adversary

216
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,560
if i want to know where a president or

217
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,560
an m a team are

218
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,639
i want to know everything about somebody

219
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,680
i'm looking to get their phone

220
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:53,840
so what uh kind of trends have you seen

221
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,759
in threat over those over the 14 years

222
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,000
and what are you seeing in terms of like

223
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:01,360
you said it's now not periodic it's

224
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,960
ever present yeah no it it's

225
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:08,080
as you pointed out it's an ecosystem of

226
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:11,280
evil and it's also an evolution of evil

227
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,840
that's there uh because the goal sets

228
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,400
for a lot of the attackers are are

229
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,239
varied

230
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,758
uh it could be i'm looking for

231
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,599
intellectual property i'm looking for

232
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,639
money i'm looking for

233
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:26,080
uh connections to other entities

234
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,960
uh as well that you have it could be

235
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,440
your you're part of a bigger contract

236
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,240
base

237
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,919
that people are looking at etc with that

238
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,039
and i think that's one of the key areas

239
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,319
that a lot of times

240
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:41,760
things pop up and disappear

241
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,320
at the same time and that evolution has

242
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,560
gone

243
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,880
from um i'll customize

244
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,399
write my own tool sets because that used

245
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,000
to be the way we would find them you

246
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,160
wouldn't find the actors you would find

247
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,680
the artifacts that were scattered

248
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,079
and then you know the actors were

249
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,120
actually there they they weren't really

250
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,560
cleaned up after themselves uh i

251
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:07,279
i remember in occasions of uh

252
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,719
decrypting their communication channels

253
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,519
uh that were there

254
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,560
and when you you looked at it you you

255
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,640
discovered that

256
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,680
you had what we referred to as like the

257
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,720
a team the b

258
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,839
team the c team uh as brian

259
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,560
pointed out it's their job as a specific

260
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,519
role

261
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,119
maybe get compromise accounts move

262
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,839
louder and then after they're done they

263
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,920
turn that over to somebody else

264
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,600
and and they continue but they always

265
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,439
have had

266
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:40,480
really good intelligence they knew where

267
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,160
things typically were they knew accounts

268
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,680
that needed to be compromised

269
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,719
they weren't guessing um on those so the

270
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,800
threats have gone

271
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,200
from those sides of it you always still

272
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,199
have the smash and grabs the guys that

273
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,959
yeah gonna they do the equivalent of

274
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,880
take a brick throw it through the window

275
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,079
empty to the jewelry store out before

276
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,320
the police come

277
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,120
and and and and run off and those are

278
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,480
still

279
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,760
relatively common but now just giving

280
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,279
the quantity

281
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:12,640
of breaches across the environment

282
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,480
then now it's i can now look and say hey

283
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,920
here's all the people that i'm looking

284
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,480
for here's potentially

285
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,399
passwords and now i have a whole set of

286
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,240
a target rich environment to say okay

287
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,560
these people i can go after them

288
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,920
and see what's happened sometimes

289
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,359
they're looking for vulnerabilities

290
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,399
sometimes they're looking through

291
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,480
accounts

292
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,519
a lot of times they look at some of the

293
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,920
other stuff

294
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,040
um one thing that's always fascinated me

295
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,120
they've always been

296
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,920
like um access control they're trying to

297
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,240
blend in

298
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,079
in a lot of cases so a lot of times they

299
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,480
will go out and still

300
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:50,160
uh uh authentication and tokens off of

301
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,600
machines for software

302
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,439
side of it or look to bypass mfa

303
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,200
and some of the cases that were there

304
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,600
because they want to use vpn they want

305
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,920
to use

306
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,600
your common access points that get in so

307
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,920
they look like somebody else they

308
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,640
pretend to be someone else that's there

309
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,160
they find quickly things like your help

310
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,880
desk account your

311
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,399
desktop support accounts your your

312
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,120
deployment accounts and they

313
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,760
look for those things they go no one's

314
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,399
going to look

315
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,640
bad at this of this doing something

316
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,399
malicious or evil it's just oh this is

317
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,800
ikea this is something else

318
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,480
so they really try to blend in and they

319
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,800
really try to heart

320
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,720
from root rootkits being deployed onto

321
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,160
the devices so that you can't see

322
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,880
anything even if you have

323
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,519
logging turned on to the ninth degree

324
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,360
it's magically not logging the details

325
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,200
for their applications and things like

326
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,279
that to the point of

327
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,040
hey this one little vulnerability of

328
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,839
this one application

329
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,599
that you're using will leverage that and

330
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,720
and go across the systems that are

331
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,160
actually there

332
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:57,200
and i think it's it goes back to there's

333
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,560
attackers continually kind of move

334
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,760
the ball forward uh and you're and

335
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,040
you have to move your structure very

336
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,040
forward as well

337
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,160
because sometimes it's like i don't have

338
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,000
the visibility

339
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,240
i don't have some of the functions you

340
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,040
see it with the emergence of tools like

341
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,880
edr

342
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,040
and things like that it's like we didn't

343
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,839
get enough logging from the endpoint to

344
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,319
be able to actually see what's going on

345
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,560
and so i require some additional

346
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,240
capabilities that are there but the idea

347
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,000
behind the attackers are

348
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,600
there and brian pointed out they're

349
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,880
there they want to stay there they want

350
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,040
to stay hidden

351
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,200
uh because each time there's a

352
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,839
compromise it's kind of a reset it's

353
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,399
like okay

354
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,639
now this goes back to the c team i'm the

355
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,959
a team and they have to go now

356
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,839
get these functions and get this levels

357
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,359
and controls

358
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:50,639
that are there and i for

359
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,519
another side of it you're also kind of

360
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,120
i want to say on your own in a lot of

361
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,760
cases that are there

362
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,920
because the a lot of times there's not a

363
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,480
lot of communication that says

364
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,360
hey adversaries are looking at this or

365
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,279
here's the technique or here is the iocs

366
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,639
for that adversary

367
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,480
you notice that when people are

368
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,320
publishing the iocs it's for something

369
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,320
that happened in 2017.

370
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,639
you're like so that that's that's an

371
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,279
important point about iocs

372
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,160
somebody was the zero day to find the

373
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,720
ioc

374
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,120
so you may have the distinction of being

375
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,320
the person that finds the ioc that warns

376
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,160
the rest of us

377
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:32,480
relying on that is a trailing indicator

378
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,800
iocs are not proactive they're only

379
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,600
proactive for numbers 2 through 100 a

380
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,000
victim

381
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,199
yeah and and the iocs you may get may

382
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,440
just be for

383
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,279
you and the iocs that are published are

384
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,199
completely different the ip address

385
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:48,079
ranges they're using the servers

386
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:50,319
the techniques so they vary their

387
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:53,120
attacks depending on their timing

388
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,880
depending on the tools they retool

389
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,800
a lot of people don't realize that

390
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,439
usually it's like when i'm trying to

391
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,240
attack

392
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,360
when the c team gives it over to the b

393
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,480
team they will

394
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,440
strip and remove and install new sets of

395
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,079
tools because

396
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,279
each time of that think about it is like

397
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,560
if i start looking for

398
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,480
one then it's cut off and then i well

399
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,160
where did they go what happened to them

400
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,959
did they pivot did they do something

401
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,600
else

402
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,119
i have to find that next hot and i have

403
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,680
to find the next hop

404
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,560
and the next top and the idea is that

405
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,399
just as we

406
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:31,040
do password changing every 60 days it's

407
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,320
not because like there the reason you've

408
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,000
passed to change your password if

409
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,600
someone has your password it's only good

410
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,199
for those period of time

411
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,720
and then i change it to something else

412
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,719
and it's good and then

413
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,399
that that password would no longer work

414
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,639
that's the same way that they

415
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,560
feel that if i change up my software and

416
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,560
i change up my tool set

417
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,839
you're going to have to either catch it

418
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,040
or you're going to actually

419
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,120
actually have to see the move and and

420
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,279
follow it and a lot of times you talk to

421
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,440
people that investigate this

422
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,959
it's dead ends you run into a point and

423
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,199
you're like it's a dead end

424
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,399
we don't know what happened they just

425
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,160
disappeared

426
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,839
or they stopped they must have got what

427
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,160
they want so so

428
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,160
and to put that historically for those

429
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,839
uh for those who haven't heard of it

430
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,439
there's an investigation in the olden

431
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,079
days and and richard and john will

432
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,839
remember this

433
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,399
moonlight maze so what most people don't

434
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,079
know and

435
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,440
a blogger tracked me down two years ago

436
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,120
i wrote the national report for

437
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,440
moonlight maze i was the navy's lead

438
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,759
investigator at ncis for that

439
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,920
uh and briefed the secretary of defense

440
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,519
but in this case to reflect back on how

441
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,800
the threat has changed

442
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,720
we had adversaries where they stopped

443
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,359
working for two days and it was a guy at

444
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,199
dia

445
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,399
his name has not been released yet so

446
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,160
i'll leave it out but

447
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,920
we looked at a calendar together and

448
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,199
figured out it was a russian orthodox

449
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,639
holiday and everybody's like oh yeah

450
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,359
everybody does that like mandiant

451
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,639
yeah ask kevin where he got the idea um

452
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,639
he's an old buddy

453
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,519
so the we had an adversary and suddenly

454
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,839
he would

455
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,279
know eunuchs perfectly on monday about

456
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,839
halfway through the day he really

457
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,920
wouldn't

458
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,279
and then he'd go away for 45 minutes we

459
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,479
were able to fingerprint

460
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:11,199
two distinct hackers of

461
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,920
you know at what is published russian

462
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,359
hackers

463
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,839
hacking through our system stealing

464
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,399
information about about it about these

465
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,120
things

466
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,199
but with this axis of evil this this

467
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,279
ecosystem of evil

468
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,639
the people that are doing one component

469
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,880
won't do the other

470
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,560
and as richard's saying they're

471
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,279
frequency hopping

472
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,719
they in the olden days they didn't have

473
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,480
the ability even at the

474
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,920
national level to move ips all around

475
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,519
the world the bulletproof servers all

476
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,000
the things we know exist

477
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,600
these groups know that they will roll up

478
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,399
a set of infrastructure

479
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,959
just to go after a bank just to go after

480
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,959
a uh

481
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,160
manufacturer for a 10 million dollar

482
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,399
ransom

483
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,719
that it's worth it to them low overhead

484
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,000
high profit they'll do it again

485
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,920
so infrastructure and iocs

486
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,680
the other thing these groups have are

487
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,800
huge labs filled with

488
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,119
every single av tool they have their own

489
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,799
tinker lab if the bell goes off they

490
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,319
won't launch this tool

491
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,240
they're doing all of that they're using

492
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:13,199
a lot of in-memory attacks

493
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,280
so that's the kind of change in the

494
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,919
infrastructure of who's attacking

495
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,839
us what i want to do is is to keep on

496
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,679
our track is i want to move over uh

497
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:24,480
richard to talk a little bit about

498
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,280
what your internal team looks like how

499
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,960
you

500
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:31,200
take this glut of information about

501
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,799
logins uh it used to be that it was so

502
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,760
easy if you saw logins to your system

503
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,879
from nigeria

504
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:40,320
it's a problem now it's a factory

505
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,120
so richard has factories and not to pick

506
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,439
on motorola

507
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,039
great company whatever uh you guys have

508
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,880
factories in all the places we normally

509
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:49,919
would consider suspect ip

510
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,840
ranges uh so your your place

511
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,280
and you're getting uh your supply chain

512
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,520
from all over the planet for the

513
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,559
precious metals and everything

514
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:02,080
how does your internal team handle

515
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:04,000
events and alerts and then how does it

516
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,360
bubble up to become an enterprise

517
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,919
incident and then i'll talk about how

518
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,080
the external team engages

519
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,039
no i think it's a it's a really good

520
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,080
thing because

521
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:17,760
i i would i would love to say that

522
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,720
we we we see these at the at the side of

523
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,559
it and

524
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,640
we can we can see the titanic uh

525
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,000
coming towards the iceberg well in

526
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,880
advance to turn the ship

527
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,200
and move somewhere else but the reality

528
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,880
for

529
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:36,000
everybody else is

530
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:39,360
a lot of times you are

531
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,559
looking at things that don't fit

532
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,959
again these attackers don't necessarily

533
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,120
work in these environments uh and this

534
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,520
pulls down into the

535
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,639
off-duty of insider threat as portions

536
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,039
of this as a

537
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,000
as even as a ransomware as a model now

538
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,559
where hey

539
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,679
if i can get you to plug this usb key in

540
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,360
i can

541
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,720
we'll take control of that and oh yeah

542
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,799
by the way we'll give you a couple

543
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,520
million dollars from just doing that

544
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,240
so that's another ecosystem that's there

545
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,559
that's like

546
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,160
great now i have to worry about that but

547
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,960
in our case a lot of times

548
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,520
you you you will cut on something that's

549
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,679
not right

550
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,120
employee wouldn't do that an employee is

551
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,400
not doing that

552
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,879
uh there's no correlation of a

553
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,520
accounting person ever talking to an

554
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,720
engineer

555
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,280
person uh kind of scenario so certain

556
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,000
things

557
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,600
will trip over that we have and you call

558
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,080
them ttps

559
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,360
the tactics of the of the groups and we

560
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,000
can see

561
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,760
what's actually going but like part of

562
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,720
the ecosystem that's there

563
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,600
is they will go up and they'll take over

564
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,080
through like

565
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,840
everything from like a wordpress

566
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,559
compromise to something else

567
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,280
they will go out and take over 1500

568
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,440
servers

569
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,440
and then slice those up between their

570
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,000
attack base and says these four the

571
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,200
command and

572
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,480
control for this organization these four

573
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,720
the command and control for this

574
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,600
organization so even if you

575
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,720
find a couple of things i only end up

576
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,918
with

577
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,480
somewhere around maybe 30 or 40 of these

578
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,320
that

579
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,159
maybe known bad the rest of them are

580
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,240
just looked good still

581
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,600
because they don't have it and so it's

582
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,919
really hard to go

583
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,918
hey this traffic that's going to this ip

584
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,159
address may be suspect

585
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,440
and things like that and they mimic the

586
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,600
traffic now they

587
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,039
they send it as it used to be hey we

588
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,240
send it as http

589
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:33,600
and it looks flawless and they use

590
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,159
a lot of people don't understand they

591
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,918
use things like what we used to refer to

592
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,720
as port knockers and things like that

593
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,960
where it's like

594
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,080
hey it comes to a normal site and the

595
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,880
url is obfuscated or something like that

596
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,559
which now is part of the puzzle but they

597
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,520
also slice that up

598
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:54,080
and say well no we'll just use hdp we'll

599
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:57,918
use normal headers before it was like

600
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:00,960
what sends 21 bytes of in an http packet

601
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:03,440
nothing never did so

602
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,280
something's up with that and and so some

603
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,440
of the volumes and some of the stuff for

604
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,240
this ideal period between the beacons

605
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,520
comes up

606
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,919
there's all these little things that may

607
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,960
come

608
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,600
up but those are not what usually trips

609
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,000
you off

610
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,520
something i refer to it as walking

611
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,760
around in the dark

612
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,120
because you stub your toe you trip over

613
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,640
something and then it's like

614
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,959
this is not really correct and this is

615
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,760
not really right and there is no reason

616
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,600
for that

617
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,919
you have to do investigations the

618
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,240
problem is sometimes now the actors

619
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,360
know that you're going to investigate

620
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,919
them so how

621
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,719
better to clear their tracks than oh let

622
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,280
me go

623
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,080
get an old piece of malware that i know

624
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,200
will get found

625
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,600
on every single antivirus that's

626
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,720
on the thing and i'll load it on your

627
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:55,678
system oh it's an

628
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:57,600
old remote access trojan from 2013

629
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,360
uh and you're like oh my gosh well

630
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,120
what's our standard procedure when you

631
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,760
get that oh we'll just re-image the

632
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,360
machine

633
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,440
uh because we don't know what else

634
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,360
happened to it so flash it

635
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,520
get rid of it reformat it load a new

636
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,280
image on and well you you've solved the

637
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,720
problem the attacker's no longer on

638
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,280
there but you also

639
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,240
erased all the forensic data that's

640
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,799
actually there

641
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,559
so they're good at manipulating you

642
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,400
without you thinking about them

643
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,918
actually manipulating you in that

644
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,799
process and

645
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,320
they know that they have a huge team and

646
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,240
you relatively to them

647
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,360
are a much smaller team so they can

648
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,120
exhaust you

649
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,760
they will literally they're like okay

650
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,639
you have 286 servers that you have to

651
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,200
take forensic

652
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,400
images on to figure out what actually

653
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,159
happened and

654
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,120
there's not an organization that's going

655
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,200
to be like yeah i've got

656
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:49,280
286 people that in 24 hours i can give

657
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,440
each person a machine and i will get a

658
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,440
detailed forensic malware reverse

659
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,520
detailed report of exactly what happened

660
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,520
doesn't exist in any organization

661
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,799
one small note i deployed teams to do

662
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,720
some of that but you're right even i

663
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,879
don't have 246 people

664
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,080
so two couple of cups of observations

665
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,200
then we had one question from the

666
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,600
audience

667
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,720
uh and i'll talk about the deploying

668
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,240
teams in a minute

669
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,760
so the question came up from hannah in

670
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,720
the audience and also about i do want to

671
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,559
do a shout out

672
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,480
win shorthaw father of infowar i saw him

673
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:23,120
not only speaking earlier but

674
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,760
actually lurking on our on our chat i'm

675
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,360
honored

676
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,120
for those of you who didn't see it go

677
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,520
check out wynn's recording

678
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,719
uh he's been in the mix since before it

679
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,440
was cool

680
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,640
um so thanks win good good to at least

681
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,440
see you one way

682
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,039
um so the uh for hannah the question was

683
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,919
on threat intelligence

684
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,520
what do we do about threat intelligence

685
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,440
so there's a couple of layers of it

686
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,039
because i want to differentiate the

687
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,559
newsweather and sports

688
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:52,000
ioc threat intelligence from real damn

689
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,039
threat intelligence and richard i'm

690
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,400
going to hand it over to you

691
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:59,200
is that like we got fake iocs now

692
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,559
i i think that's a new new area so yeah

693
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,799
a couple of quick hits

694
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,480
the iocs that are all over the planet

695
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,240
are a lagging indicator those are people

696
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,120
that were victimized last month

697
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,400
last year whatever um and if somebody's

698
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,239
coming at you like they would at a

699
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,679
motorola like they would in a bank like

700
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,200
they would if they're just trying to

701
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,360
take money from you

702
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,720
yeah the doorknob knocking or like

703
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,639
walking through a parking lot looking

704
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,240
for unlocked cars yeah all that stuff's

705
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,799
great threat intel fine

706
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,720
the adversaries are putting fake

707
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:30,480
information into those channels

708
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:32,880
to give you false posit positive fatigue

709
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,400
that is a lot different than all source

710
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,159
fusion about having

711
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,760
companies there are many of them mine

712
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,720
happens to be one but there are a bunch

713
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,879
of them

714
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,679
uh data miners a great company for

715
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,440
physicals and other threats uh for iq

716
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,960
straws freeberg does it too just when i

717
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,600
get trouble my own not wrapping my own

718
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,640
brand

719
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,120
uh but there are a lot of great

720
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,679
companies but that's a focused

721
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,439
threat intelligence looking for dark web

722
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,400
talking about abusing your loyalty

723
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,880
programs

724
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,720
how to how to uh jack the sim cards on a

725
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,600
motorola or how to get through the app

726
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,640
store

727
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,719
those kind of abuses are not

728
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,640
iocs and one final thing if you're

729
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,640
getting iocs and they're not

730
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,679
in some way automatically integrating

731
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,440
into your system

732
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,039
you're just reading a very badly

733
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,279
formatted newspaper

734
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:19,600
so if you're reading your thread intel

735
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:21,120
and it's not actioning into sticks taxi

736
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,840
and other things that make your life

737
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,918
easy consider automation because you're

738
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,760
probably behind the power curve

739
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,840
and your your investigator having those

740
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,360
iocs to query after an event is not

741
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,399
really the purpose of that part of

742
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,080
threatening tone

743
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,520
yeah so over to you for thread intel

744
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,840
then we'll talk about when you

745
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,360
pull the when you pop smoke and i jump

746
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,600
in

747
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,360
so this is a this is actually a real

748
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:47,439
timely thing if you saw

749
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:50,240
um late uh

750
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,559
last week or something you you had cesa

751
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,320
come

752
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:59,200
out with a a new apt actor

753
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:00,960
uh on on that side there was 39 and 41

754
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,880
everybody calls all these things there

755
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,400
you need first part of thread until

756
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,559
you need the rosetta stone to actually

757
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,960
figure out who the bad guys actually are

758
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,399
and

759
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,320
why are there kittens why are there

760
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,600
kittens on the system why would kitties

761
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,360
try to attack the thing or they're

762
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,000
getting more cat videos i don't

763
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,199
understand

764
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,679
or why are these pandas running amok uh

765
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,120
everybody calls things flowers pandas

766
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,520
colors

767
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,879
it doesn't matter once you get the

768
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,120
decoder ring you can go

769
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,559
but this is a really good example at the

770
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,719
end of the report they listed all the

771
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,240
iocs here's the hashes here's the ip

772
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,320
addresses and everything else

773
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,039
but the detailed report and this is

774
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,879
where the problem with iocs is that

775
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,640
they're so unique to organizations and

776
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,039
everything else that you don't

777
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,159
get an insight into it but in the report

778
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:47,360
itself

779
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,039
they told you here is the registry hive

780
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,639
that they are actually storing these

781
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,720
things in for persistence

782
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,679
here are the registry entries that

783
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,080
they're doing

784
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,960
here is the dll that they're actually

785
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,120
using

786
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,559
to sideload their their particular

787
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,039
malware and everything else

788
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,158
but those are never in the ioc report

789
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,120
you really have to

790
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,000
curate iocs to your own environment and

791
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,559
taking those

792
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,640
registry entries and going let me search

793
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,120
across my enterprise and see if

794
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,000
anything has those registries entries in

795
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,399
that

796
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,360
is the is the stage so if you look at

797
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,959
the iocs

798
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,199
they're the tip of the iceberg that's

799
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,600
there you really have to to make

800
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,840
the thread intel useful you need to be

801
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,600
curating your own thread intel so taking

802
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:33,439
that information in

803
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:34,320
taking what is going to be unique to the

804
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,360
organization

805
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,399
it's like it's a step up into the thing

806
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,479
it's like because they don't

807
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:42,320
using the same hash they're using a

808
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,480
completely different file that's there

809
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,879
now they may not change this and this is

810
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:50,000
one of those things to be able to do

811
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,480
the quantity of work they do they're

812
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,640
highly highly highly automated

813
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,480
so if you think about automation in a

814
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,679
way there are certain things

815
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,279
if i'm building cars i can't

816
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,640
say hey guess what i'm going to change

817
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,720
the windshield on this one i want to

818
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,440
change the door on this one no it has to

819
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,919
fit

820
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,880
in that area so i can't make those

821
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,000
changes so

822
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,679
those registry entries the the the file

823
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,159
name may change but you know what the

824
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,080
spouse size doesn't change uh

825
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,440
with that so you can get some of those

826
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,120
iocs and say i don't want to look for

827
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,600
the file i just want to look for files

828
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,199
that have

829
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:27,520
this extension or the file name is

830
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,320
alpha character alpha character numeric

831
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,320
numeric

832
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,840
alpha character alphacare the numeric

833
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,039
numeric and it's all the same the

834
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,959
numbers change

835
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,520
the other stuff does they use a hash

836
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,399
value to pull off the id and create

837
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,399
their own

838
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,158
all you need is the lexicon to be able

839
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,959
to move that and i think

840
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,880
using the using that thread intel to

841
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,520
develop your own thread until for your

842
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,760
organization is how you

843
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,840
successfully do it if you're just

844
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,760
scanning and looking for hashes

845
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,360
you're like i don't see anybody that's a

846
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,799
good thing and it's like you're not

847
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,399
never going to see anybody because that

848
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,879
was a bank

849
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,678
you are a insurance organization or

850
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,679
you're a

851
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,279
manufacturing organization completely

852
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,880
different hashes that are going to be

853
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:12,960
used and probably

854
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:16,240
unique to your own organization

855
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,919
agreed and now as we crest into the 11

856
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,880
o'clock so we got about five minutes

857
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,720
let's talk about

858
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,080
you know how to pop smoke and call in a

859
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,679
cyber smoke jumper team

860
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,279
and then we'll open it up to questions

861
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,640
or i'll give you the floor for a final

862
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:29,039
war story

863
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,000
so you've done everything you can you've

864
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,799
escalated up

865
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
you suddenly realize somebody's inside

866
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,840
the fence line

867
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,120
now the other thing about ransomware for

868
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,840
those of you that feel good about your

869
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,520
backups

870
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,279
having good backups is no longer

871
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,440
qualifies you to get out of this

872
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:45,120
they exfiltrate data first and they will

873
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,720
still extort you

874
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,879
now what you are going to reduce is your

875
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,559
business interruption your downtime your

876
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,799
third party liability

877
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,480
and a bunch of other things but you're

878
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,879
still going to be extorted

879
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,240
so you know gear up for that depending

880
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,840
on what they stole

881
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,440
and your ability to figure out what they

882
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,799
stole and whether it's worth 10 million

883
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,159
dollars in embarrassment

884
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,639
is a real good thing to be doing a

885
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,640
damage assessment so

886
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,640
you get to that point you've gone to

887
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,840
you've you're the cso you've gone to the

888
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,159
cio you've talked

889
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,080
now to the general counsel there's a

890
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,840
problem

891
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,520
you pick up the phone and it rings and

892
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,000
again i'm not talking about motorola but

893
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,120
in general

894
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,480
ring somebody middle of the night

895
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,120
usually on a sunday morning on a

896
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,360
three-day weekend or a friday afternoon

897
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,039
um and by the way too hannah i think

898
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,719
that's because threat analysts try and

899
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,640
clear their desk on a friday afternoon

900
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,720
and find all the tuesday alerts

901
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,840
but i'll digress on why they're screwing

902
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,120
up my friends never hunt

903
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:43,199
never hunt on fridays

904
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,039
days unless you don't want a weekend if

905
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,039
you can find something

906
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:51,840
yeah or when you don't hunt on friday

907
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,840
that's what happens sunday morning

908
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:59,600
the issue becomes the cso to a degree

909
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:01,760
loses control of the response

910
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,840
the general counsel calls an outside

911
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,879
counsel the outside counsel hires

912
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,639
strauss freeburg

913
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,159
mandiant fireeye uh kivu just want to be

914
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,679
fair play for those of you who come

915
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,720
these conferences i

916
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,399
win myself richard we are we we love

917
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,720
hate every other company we don't work

918
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,559
for

919
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,000
so it's all good just make sure you're

920
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:22,240
picking a good one

921
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,320
don't cheap out on your heart surgeon

922
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,799
the uh they bring in a company like that

923
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:29,678
what's that like as a cso when suddenly

924
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:32,000
your team doubles triples or quadruples

925
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,080
but it's matrix managed and you've got

926
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,120
now two lawyers between you and

927
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,519
somebody with a wrench yeah no and and

928
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,279
you you you have to do it and in in some

929
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,200
of the cases you may be dealing with

930
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,240
partnerships because we've done a lot of

931
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,799
work with

932
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,360
one of your former employees uh that you

933
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,080
were

934
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,519
that you were working with as where as a

935
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,519
side of it because

936
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,760
they are finding things that say hey do

937
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,519
you know about this have you seen this

938
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,879
uh we want to work with you and partner

939
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,039
with you and and

940
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,000
the partnerships work we put people in

941
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,399
jail uh

942
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,039
on their side of it that's there so it

943
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,760
does

944
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,320
it does down to the stuff that yeah you

945
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,320
you see

946
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,480
these these levels of stuff from the

947
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,240
digital crime side of it

948
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,760
but i think it's one of the things to

949
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:20,559
understand that

950
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:23,919
um it's really hard to have everyone

951
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:27,039
in your organization or in your team

952
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:30,240
that you're going to have a full start

953
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:31,039
to finish with the capabilities that you

954
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,519
need

955
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:35,279
because you don't have that in almost

956
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,679
any organization you're fine it's like

957
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,000
oh

958
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,760
great i we have a digital forensic

959
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,679
person that's super good i have a

960
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,240
malware reversing person that's super

961
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,399
good

962
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,840
that's good oh great this was built on

963
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:48,959
this this this was a

964
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,360
this was a golang version of malware

965
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,240
versus a python version well oh i'd

966
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,320
never oh hey

967
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,399
richard rachel i mean so i got a call

968
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,120
the other day a

969
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,399
client had malware on one of their

970
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:04,000
systems

971
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:05,918
it was conficker the operating system

972
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,600
was windows 95

973
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:11,200
it was a manufacturer still making

974
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,719
sensor devices for the department of

975
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,080
defense i've been making them for 30

976
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,200
years

977
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:19,279
and i was talking to our senior most uh

978
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,960
forensics person in stras-freeburg

979
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,799
and i said well we need somebody to go

980
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,399
up and help them with this

981
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,918
and he goes oh we'll send so and so i'm

982
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,360
like we can't he goes why not they're

983
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,679
really good i said

984
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,439
they're only 30 years old they've never

985
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,600
seen the operating system

986
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,240
and i said he goes oh no and i'm like

987
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:39,039
guess who gets to get on a plane

988
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,559
so the oldest guy on our team had to go

989
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,559
take care of the thing

990
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,720
because the operating system had not

991
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:48,879
actually been seen in the wild

992
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:50,799
in you know 25 years yeah and so

993
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,399
another guy called another old guy he

994
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,840
held up the install disc and i'm like

995
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:56,000
hold on to that we might need it

996
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,879
so some of these organizations when you

997
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,720
look at

998
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,960
augmenting your team in this emergency

999
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,840
situation you might have a malware

1000
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,440
reversal

1001
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:06,158
let me ask you a question how many

1002
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,600
malware are they reversing a year

1003
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,280
that are actively hitting other

1004
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,560
organizations probably pretty few they

1005
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,159
work for you

1006
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,679
how many different operating systems

1007
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,079
like even my

1008
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,040
best people specialize in operating

1009
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,520
systems

1010
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,040
it's okay to and this is a cso general

1011
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,520
it's not about calling me

1012
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,239
yeah it's okay to ask for help it's okay

1013
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,359
to bring in

1014
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:30,000
somebody for a mechanical turk job

1015
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,359
and get it done right yeah anybody can

1016
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,480
google their way through it that's not

1017
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,719
going to be cost effective

1018
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,079
yeah it's not one not cost effective two

1019
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,040
you don't get the answer and you get

1020
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,280
something stupid

1021
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,119
at the end they go oh it was effective

1022
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,079
with a run-of-the-mill version of

1023
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,720
malware and yeah well yeah we've seen it

1024
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,560
but why

1025
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:51,759
is it only on these 10 vps pcs

1026
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,679
this seems really strange uh and and

1027
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,679
and those are the things you you you

1028
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,400
definitely don't want to get into but

1029
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,720
you need help it's a it's a niche that

1030
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,440
we don't have and even if you did have

1031
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,759
again we see it time and time again

1032
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:09,040
where it's like yeah i'm a pc guy

1033
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,920
uh oh well this is a mac malware oh

1034
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,359
right i'm lost at that point in time so

1035
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,520
you do need help in

1036
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,480
some of the areas that are there you

1037
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,960
also

1038
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,839
if you're a global company this is not

1039
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,720
going to happen

1040
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,759
anywhere near where there is either an

1041
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,040
ip person

1042
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:29,200
or another person it never happens

1043
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,680
and oh yeah by the way your your

1044
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,480
connection is like a sippy straw

1045
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,279
uh trying to suck bandwidth through so a

1046
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,520
lot of times

1047
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,400
to your point is like we get on planes

1048
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,560
why because

1049
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,720
it's so much faster than trying to do

1050
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,279
things remotely and everything else

1051
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,118
well i just i just worked an insider

1052
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,839
threat case a couple other types of

1053
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,839
cases besides the evil external hacker

1054
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,839
one employee is harassing another

1055
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,520
employee now you're in a sexual

1056
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:58,560
harassment investigation

1057
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,920
or equal opportunity investigation you

1058
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,440
definitely want somebody outside the

1059
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,079
organization handling that

1060
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,280
uh the the the the tale of woe i'll tell

1061
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,320
you as a friend of mine

1062
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,880
richard he was a cso for six years

1063
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,400
doing great he would have made 14 but

1064
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,000
the guy he investigated that was

1065
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,960
harassing another employee and that was

1066
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,359
not fired

1067
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,440
was appointed to the cio in his sixth

1068
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:23,279
year

1069
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,960
and anyhoo yeah yeah

1070
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,119
the loveliness of investigations you

1071
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,119
never know who you might end up with and

1072
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,119
sometimes you just don't want to know

1073
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,320
uh yeah or and they might get promoted

1074
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,920
above you after you've done the

1075
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,960
investigation a couple years and they

1076
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,359
won't forget

1077
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,880
yeah so i'm gonna i'm gonna pause us

1078
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,640
there i'm gonna do a uh

1079
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,320
one quick question out to the group i

1080
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,480
know we have a lot of

1081
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,160
csos from government and commercial that

1082
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,160
have attended this session and again

1083
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,200
father win himself another not tip of

1084
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,598
the cap

1085
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,240
the uh if there's any questions for

1086
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,880
richard and i to close out on um

1087
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,399
or richard what else ask you uh as a

1088
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,320
closing thought as we're waiting to see

1089
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,680
if a question or two come in

1090
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,480
is what's next we all everybody moved to

1091
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,240
remote

1092
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,440
we're all just figuring that out we're

1093
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,759
all trying to figure out the fishing

1094
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:13,119
scans for covid yeah yeah yeah

1095
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,960
but as you look to the next year out

1096
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,720
we're gonna get through whatever kind of

1097
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,320
election this is and whatever the

1098
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,839
consternation of that is and hopefully

1099
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,800
get back to some kind of semblance of

1100
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:22,799
normalcy in america

1101
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:28,480
what do you see as the next big wave for

1102
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:31,760
c cells

1103
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:34,560
um wow uh

1104
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,040
more pain and suffering unfortunately i

1105
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,279
think

1106
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,440
i wish i had good positive things it's

1107
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,359
2020. i'm like 2021 it's got to be

1108
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,920
better than 2020.

1109
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:47,200
uh yeah for a lot of things but not

1110
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:50,880
necessarily for cyber security because

1111
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,879
we see this ransomware item that came

1112
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,839
and started with something really really

1113
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:59,440
small and and it's progressed into now

1114
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:02,320
it is a huge money-making kind of thing

1115
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,359
we deal with super complex environments

1116
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,920
we still

1117
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:07,359
complexity is a killer for us there's so

1118
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,839
many things just think about it

1119
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:10,560
just before when we were doing stuff i

1120
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:13,599
went to a

1121
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,640
i went to an ad server got the logs and

1122
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,599
i can tell you

1123
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,078
everything that went on for for logging

1124
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,400
and everything

1125
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,079
else now with mfa and using third

1126
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,240
parties and everything else now i got to

1127
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,440
go talk to microsoft and google and here

1128
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,919
and here and here

1129
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,560
just to accumulate the pieces of data

1130
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,280
and that's

1131
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,119
all in taking time and you can you can

1132
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,800
you can quantify it put

1133
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:38,240
uh ai ml whatever buzzword you want to

1134
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,839
and at the end of the day you just

1135
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,279
end up with the anomalies bubbling up to

1136
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,960
the top and you're like well this

1137
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,200
doesn't explain anything i just

1138
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,960
it's strange so that and this this goes

1139
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,720
to a question that when short tall to

1140
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,200
the benefit of the audience just posted

1141
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,319
in

1142
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,279
is the average and all quota stat that

1143
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,280
win didn't have but

1144
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,520
the average cso has somewhere around

1145
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,240
especially at a company size motorola

1146
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:03,200
about 150 to 200 technologies that

1147
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:06,000
you're looking at across the waterfront

1148
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,118
what are some of the simplification

1149
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,760
things

1150
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,440
that you're excited about now one i'll

1151
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,000
proffer up is

1152
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,440
and i full disclosure i was the chief of

1153
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,640
cyber crime intelligence for all of

1154
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,560
microsoft

1155
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,040
um what i'm seeing among all of the

1156
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:24,000
cloud vendors again to be polite

1157
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,200
uh amazon google microsoft even oracle

1158
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,400
to a degree

1159
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,359
they're incorporating anti-phishing and

1160
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,480
other things

1161
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:34,880
into the cloud platform so they are

1162
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,400
normalizing some of that complexity what

1163
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,040
other areas like

1164
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,960
uh firewalls and waff are you seeing

1165
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,720
convergence in where you're able to get

1166
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,760
rid of some of the complexity and great

1167
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,000
question win

1168
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,520
yeah no i i think the complexities are

1169
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,839
now coming down

1170
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,720
uh and i look at it from a couple of

1171
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:53,279
things one

1172
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,640
if i actually am able to knock down

1173
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,680
things

1174
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,879
my noise level drops so

1175
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:03,200
what i'm actually looking at now is

1176
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:05,359
for lack of a better term clean internet

1177
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,319
or some of the other level i'm actually

1178
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,078
not seeing

1179
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:10,000
the things my firewalls are not getting

1180
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:13,040
brute force all day long

1181
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,160
or other areas and that's a

1182
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:18,000
huge inkling of okay

1183
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,759
if i can get rid of the noise i don't

1184
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,440
have to spend 20 minutes figuring out

1185
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,400
that this is just some script kitty

1186
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,680
running some

1187
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:29,599
brute force attempt and going away uh

1188
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:32,720
and in a way i think as we move into

1189
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:35,760
the the world of um

1190
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:38,399
distribution and segmentation

1191
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,200
and the idea that it's it's no longer

1192
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,079
hardware

1193
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,640
in other words hey i can't get a piece

1194
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,640
of

1195
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,720
hardware i need i need some i need to

1196
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:49,920
put a sensor here we used to do

1197
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,919
our mine sensors yeah

1198
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,440
oh you need something local on the

1199
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,119
network to actually tell what the hell

1200
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,160
the network's doing how many span ports

1201
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,760
do you have left yeah

1202
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:02,720
i remember so but now with the world of

1203
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:05,040
uh vms and everything else it's a box

1204
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,319
with and and i can stick it on there and

1205
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,560
i can see everything that's on a

1206
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:10,400
manufacturing segment a lab segment or

1207
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,880
anything else that's flowing around

1208
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,400
which now gives me more insight into

1209
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,640
didn't hit here didn't hit here it's

1210
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,240
like a house with a bunch of doors

1211
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,160
if the doors are locked guess what it

1212
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:23,359
didn't go through so that now i know

1213
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,879
where whatever the rodent or the mouse

1214
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:27,040
the panda the kitten

1215
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,000
stuck in my house at and i'm like he's

1216
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,000
over here

1217
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,240
uh and he's not moved anywhere else in

1218
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,240
the world so you get some visibility

1219
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,479
people looking at the visibility i think

1220
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,598
is key one of the other key elements i

1221
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,960
think is we now

1222
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:42,720
give respect to the endpoints before the

1223
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,400
endpoints were like it's just a pc

1224
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,319
it doesn't matter anymore now we're

1225
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,920
putting a lot of telemetry on the pc and

1226
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,279
seeing what the pc does because at the

1227
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,599
end of the day

1228
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,440
and i it's an interesting aspect of that

1229
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:57,200
from an investigation point of view

1230
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:58,480
is it the person or is it the pc that

1231
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,078
has something on it that

1232
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,240
is pretending to be the person that's

1233
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:04,240
actually doing the dirty work

1234
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,240
that's there absolutely and with and

1235
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:09,118
without thought i'm gonna uh

1236
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,439
uh go to close thanks to uh a little

1237
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:14,960
nudge and a small book from john

1238
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,680
uh one uh to the entire audience thank

1239
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,520
you to

1240
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,799
a public service announcement mergers

1241
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:22,319
and acquisitions

1242
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:24,560
the adversaries are timing and attacking

1243
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:25,680
either the acquiring company to ride it

1244
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,200
into a merger or

1245
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,040
afterwards they figure it's the weak

1246
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,960
length in the motorola chain

1247
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,319
or anybody's chain after you've acquired

1248
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,839
them and believe me for the mega

1249
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:38,000
breeches i've worked this year

1250
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:40,640
that's accurate um so from myself

1251
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,920
for uh john johnson and richard over to

1252
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,520
you to say goodbye

1253
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,839
thank you everybody for attending the

1254
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,960
session please reach out on linkedin

1255
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:51,279
uh or other venues and let john know uh

1256
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,599
if this was useful in your time really

1257
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,079
appreciate it over to you richard

1258
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:57,119
thanks great opportunity great questions

1259
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:00,400
and everything else

1260
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:02,560
i'll briefly touch on uh wins question

1261
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,920
as a no nudges

1262
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:08,640
iot world is getting better

1263
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,200
it's still back to parts of the issues

1264
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,759
just like

1265
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,279
everything else it's still new but every

1266
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,160
single problem that we've

1267
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,200
seen we've come up with solutions that

1268
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,759
will

1269
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,879
wrap over the top of iot in the not so

1270
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,040
distant future

1271
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,160
and i think that we have we've solved a

1272
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,640
lot of things

1273
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,279
we've been doing this in my case 35

1274
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,078
years

1275
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,800
and a lot of other people and it's it's

1276
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:33,119
a bad

1277
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,520
disconnection because we keep seeing the

1278
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,839
same problems we've had

1279
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:41,119
and to say 35 years ago is the same

1280
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:42,560
bucket i can go get my rainbow books

1281
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,720
confidentiality integrity and

1282
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:47,279
availability yeah

1283
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,759
it's still today the same thing so it's

1284
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,119
not

1285
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,319
the way it's not it's just the attackers

1286
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,839
are getting there and i think that is

1287
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:56,079
the critical thing is like

1288
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:57,920
it's not those issues and you brought

1289
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,920
into the thing that we talked about

1290
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,720
today you have technology process and

1291
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,800
people we've been working on technology

1292
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,839
we started working on people

1293
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,560
that process thing that no one wants to

1294
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:11,680
touch is the

1295
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:13,200
next area which gets it it is and the

1296
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,319
two thoughts on iot

1297
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:18,319
one network segmentation is a lot easier

1298
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,880
in software to find networks or by using

1299
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:22,240
things like

1300
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:24,640
garticore or radical segmentation uh

1301
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,359
two we need to learn how to protect the

1302
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,680
business

1303
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,560
process that rides on the computers not

1304
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,399
the computers

1305
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,640
but now we truly are out of time and

1306
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,680
john's gonna turn on my ankle taser if i

1307
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,359
don't shut out

1308
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:39,839
oh he tases my computer so it's okay

1309
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:41,119
i can only go 50 feet thank you again

1310
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:43,680
everybody and john

1311
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:45,240
thank you and win talk to you soon

1312
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,240
thanks guys

1313
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,240
thanks
