all of you here with us today and our

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,240
topic is

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,680
it's the end of the world as we know it

6
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,880

15
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,680
things uh

16
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,200

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,160
to have my panelists introduce

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,320
themselves

19
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,718

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,240
well awesome thanks for being with us

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,920
today well as we all know

46
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,000
2020 has been quite the year for

47
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,720
everybody and that's great

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,520
uh our first topic is going to be with

49
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,759
it's great

50
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,200
it starts with an earthquake so we've

51
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,759
actually had a few earthquakes

52
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,520
actually in 2020 including one a small

53
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,000
one that we felt in georgia not too long

54
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,200
ago

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,360
but that aside of

56
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,520
everything else as with every great

57
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,320
challenge or shake up we have to assess

58
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,920
the state

59
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,439
where we're in and what we have to work

60
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,560
with now that the ground

61
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,000
has uh settled but maybe rattled a

62
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,560
little bit first

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,720
um like the rebel alliance strategizing

64
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,840
against the galactic empire security

65
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,359
leaders

66
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,280
need to review the people processes and

67
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,319
technology to strengthen

68
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,080
the lacking in combat all these crazy

69
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,359
cyber attacks that we're having

70
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,200
uh out there so really discovering uh

71
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,480
the security tools and measures that are

72
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,440
working and making them

73
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,560
even better it's really about surviving

74
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,400
and flourishing

75
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,920
uh during this time would you all agree

76
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,280
about that

77
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,359
so with that said um let's go ahead and

78
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,560
start to begin our questions

79
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,400
uh the chosen ones anakin luke and ray

80
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,080
all had to leave behind what they knew

81
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,200
to face the unknown

82
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,200
so amanda what do you think about how do

83
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,799
you react to the sudden changes in your

84
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,159
security environment

85
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,920
and its processes and were you prepared

86
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,679
for do you think that you're prepared

87
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,359
for what really is going to come next i

88
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,519
mean it has been like

89
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,280
a game of asteroids uh at the end of the

90
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,159
day 2020.

91
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,959
yeah no i i mean i'm gonna really take a

92
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,879
big leap here

93
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,120
and just say that i feel like i'm trying

94
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,040
to encapsulate the aura of luke

95
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,480
and that he was always able to pivot in

96
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,959
different environments and get the high

97
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,319
ground

98
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,080
also for some people for obi-wan but uh

99
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,920
i think that the biggest thing that was

100
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,840
difficult that we had to

101
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,200
deal with the unpredictability of this

102
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,200
was threat modeling so

103
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,040
how we would have attacks coming at us

104
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,319
was very different from a hybrid or at

105
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,280
this point a completely remote

106
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,958
environment

107
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,799
so we had to change our threat modeling

108
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,400
and redo them and we had to run through

109
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,840
them again to try to figure out where

110
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,440
our weaknesses were

111
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,879
and then try to shore up any of those in

112
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,560
a very quick time frame so we did

113
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,560
definitely reassess like which tools

114
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,840
were the most useful for us

115
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,319
and we definitely took a little bit of a

116
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,519
hit in ueba because the profiling kind

117
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,958
of got thrown out the door

118
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,640
you know what times people were signing

119
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,519
on and from what ips and stuff started

120
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,119
to just really

121
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,959
be something we couldn't rely on for our

122
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,680
investigation workflow

123
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,200
so i think at the end we focused on

124
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,120
refreshing and making sure we did have

125
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,399
to add a few tools on that were for this

126
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,480
type of environment

127
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,159
we had to work on the people to make

128
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,518
sure that the security culture pivoted

129
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,199
to their home environment

130
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,040
so we had to teach them and we did

131
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,799
webinars on this as well like

132
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,800
get your router don't use default

133
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,840
passwords like i know my security is

134
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,840
good at the company

135
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,599
i don't know about yours at home so we

136
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,638
had to try to retrain people and make

137
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,479
sure that they really

138
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,680
leveled up their home security as well

139
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,479
since that's what they're they're going

140
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,880
through

141
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,520
so i think we did a lot of assessment on

142
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,960
the people

143
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,198
the process and the tech that we were

144
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,320
using and we shored those gaps up if we

145
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,040
found any within

146
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,719
he was like six weeks well really at the

147
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,199
end of the day i think everyone

148
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,120
at home uh working remotely got a free

149
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,720
great security assessment in their home

150
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,400
uh networks i like to think about it

151
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,759
that's how well that's how i'll market

152
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,679
it that'll be great the whole company

153
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,919
will love it

154
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,840
so joey the jedi lost sight of

155
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,080
themselves thanks to the dark side of

156
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,479
the force and were destroyed

157
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,000
what have you done to reclaim visibility

158
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,840
in your new security environment

159
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,840
and to locate these vulnerabilities

160
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
you know i think for us um our general

161
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,080
tech stack you know we had we had

162
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,560
started the journey of

163
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,440
everything to the cloud you know a while

164
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,479
ago

165
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,199
everyone had laptops we didn't have to

166
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,479
make

167
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,479
a lot of major technology changes

168
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,599
to to continue operating the way we had

169
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,080
what we found

170
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,880
was the biggest challenge was um

171
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,880
certainly for us

172
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,159
in healthcare um with our clinical

173
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,840
workforce

174
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,600
you know and and some of our other team

175
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,479
members those in the fitness centers and

176
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,320
places like that

177
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,240
they were not acclimated to being in

178
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,599
front of a screen on a computer eight

179
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,160
hours a day

180
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,759
they were acclimated to working person

181
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,199
to person face to face dealing with

182
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,319
patients dealing with doctors dealing

183
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,080
with numbers

184
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,440
and so having to pivot the entire work

185
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,960
like where they work didn't matter as

186
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,719
much the fact that they weren't engaging

187
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,799
with humans directly they were engaging

188
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,600
through a screen and that

189
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,880
made a lot of other technology use cases

190
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,560
come up that we hadn't really had to

191
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,319
navigate as much before right they were

192
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,280
finding different uses for teams they

193
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,160
were finding different ways to

194
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,559
collaborate

195
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,000
they were using tools that weren't

196
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,160
necessarily sanctioned

197
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,600
right um technology is so ubiquitously

198
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,199
available to

199
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,800
individuals right now they don't need to

200
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,240
rely on an organization for that

201
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,360
so if they decided they wanted to go

202
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,080
stand up a slack channel and do

203
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,440
something

204
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,639
there was very little prohibiting them

205
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,160
from doing that if they weren't using

206
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,919
corporate credentials and so

207
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,360
having to kind of bring that in having

208
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,318
to get the workforce

209
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,000
educated um kind of you know amanda to

210
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,520
what you were saying right it's like i

211
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,880
don't know what you're doing at home and

212
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,639
if you don't need to do it through the

213
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,560
technology that i'm provisioning

214
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,639
there is there there's certainly risk

215
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,360
there um we you know we ran into issues

216
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,479
around

217
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,000
having to um deal with things like

218
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,919
what's alexa listening to while you're

219
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,280
working right all of those kind of

220
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,880
things came up so

221
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,400
uh those those are some things that you

222
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,919
know we hadn't fully planned for and had

223
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,638
to navigate through

224
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,919
and i agree the the user behavior

225
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,440
monitoring right all of a sudden

226
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,479
people's hours are way off

227
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,919
they're working from here they're

228
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,039
working from there all kinds of

229
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,840
different things were happening so we

230
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,318
had to adjust to that pretty quickly as

231
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,159
well

232
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,240
yeah it definitely set the world upside

233
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,280
down uh at the beginning i think things

234
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,680
have settled in

235
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,719
but um there's a bit of disruption for

236
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,560
those that are

237
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,240
you know certainly having children at

238
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,319
home and having to

239
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,759
educate that way from a distance a

240
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,000
learning perspective as well

241
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,360
pairing with maintaining the work that

242
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,919
they have to keep up with in the

243
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,639
meetings

244
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,479
and to your point joey the fatigue is um

245
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,120
definitely real out there

246
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,039
um and i'm seeing it across the board

247
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,199
you know i have family members that are

248
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,800
teachers actually and they're they're

249
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,520
feeling the fatigue

250
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,560
and the stress of preparing for like a

251
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,440
webinar

252
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,280
every single hour of the day uh and even

253
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,120
having to take some things out there

254
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,239
you know so it's a lot it's been a lot

255
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,240
of change for a lot of people

256
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,878
it's also like uh stranger things we're

257
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,879
living in the upside down for those

258
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:15,440
people who are stranger things fans

259
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,080
yeah absolutely so ricardo this is meant

260
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,199
for you

261
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:22,560
uh for sith always two there are a

262
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,720
master and an apprentice

263
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,319
uh as a seat so how are you assessing

264
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,120
what further tools and training your

265
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,440
security

266
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,479
team needs to detect and respond to

267
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,240
threats

268
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,000
especially hidden ones that are out

269
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,959
there and do you have

270
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,519
these essential apprentices on your team

271
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,359
or

272
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,560
have you had team members help you in

273
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,640
this type of process

274
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,959
and have you seen some folks on your

275
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,959
team also or even in your organization

276
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,040
really step up during the pandemic

277
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,199
and helping you overcome these new

278
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,240
challenges

279
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,920
but what a fantastic question um i'd

280
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,160
like to say that

281
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,839
our team has traditionally been almost

282
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,839
like a brick and mortar team

283
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,200
if i were to put it like that where they

284
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,880
go into the office

285
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,640
they know where the data's at it's in

286
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,360
this it's in the data center

287
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,560
they're not used to having a remote

288
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,640
workforce

289
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,640
neither are they uh used to really work

290
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,040
in sas applications and ios

291
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,640
applications so there has been quite a

292
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,319
bit of tooling that has

293
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:25,040
um has been introduced to our team uh

294
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,560
how to work on infrastructure as a code

295
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,800
as we went remote

296
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,760
we adopted various parts of the cloud

297
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,920
very quickly

298
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,760
because it made a lot of sense that

299
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,079
we're already tapping into

300
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,640
the sas market but we didn't have our

301
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,040
traditional controls in that sas sense

302
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,839
so what we had is a few members of the

303
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,000
team said

304
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,080
well i'm very interested in coding i

305
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,839
really like the idea of getting

306
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,279
into api seeing what we can do to

307
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,640
protect organization get

308
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,519
greater visibility so i had these hidden

309
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,839
gems start

310
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,360
to come up and say this is cool i'd

311
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,519
really like to tackle this

312
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,440
and i gave them the opportunity to work

313
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,760
with those specific product teams

314
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,519
to better understand how we could get

315
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,480
greater visibility controls in our sas

316
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,360
environment

317
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,720
and then just suppose on our emerging

318
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,200
cloud environment

319
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,959
we already had started this process but

320
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,240
there's an opportunity for us to fast

321
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,000
track the training

322
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,560
the ability to get our hands dirty in

323
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,480
the environment and it was a multi

324
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,640
not just security but i t and the

325
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,800
business collaborative effort to really

326
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,680
embrace the cloud and learn how it

327
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,640
functions

328
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,279
and have it be as as a driver and a

329
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,680
catalyst

330
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,040
to move a lot of our legacy applications

331
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,519
into a cloud environment

332
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,519
it was it was a really unique dynamic as

333
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,279
we started going to remote

334
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,800
and then of course you had a few of the

335
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,240
people on the team they're like

336
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,959
are we really going to allow split

337
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,720
totaling oh my god oh no the house will

338
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,439
burn down if we do that

339
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,640
and then you took a step back and said

340
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,320
why does it matter

341
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,399
if you're putting the controls around

342
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,360
the data around the sas environment

343
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,480
it shouldn't matter if you're on

344
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,279
grandma's ipad your dog's kindle

345
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,720
whatever it is the date the controls

346
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,240
should follow the data and that's the

347
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,040
new approach that we've been taking

348
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,320
and it's it's a little different to have

349
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,360
everyone's opinions

350
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,440
start converge together but it's really

351
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,800
neat and unique and i don't under i

352
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,600
don't know if under

353
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,279
what circumstances this confluence of

354
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,480
different ideas to one

355
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,279
solid goal would ever happen i'm not

356
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,040
saying

357
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,800
pandemic's great by any stretch of

358
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,240
imagination i hate being stuck in my

359
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,640
basement every day

360
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,600
there's been some blessings in in this

361
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,920
cloud you know

362
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,680
and this thing uh you know overall i

363
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,680
think there's been some awakenings

364
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,959
um you know on different things from

365
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,399
different levels

366
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:46,160
i mean i'm an optimist i like to look at

367
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,480
the glass house full

368
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,680
at the end of the day so how i've been

369
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,079
kind of

370
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,959
managing some of this you know overall

371
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,959
is

372
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,959
taking a step back and reflecting of

373
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,920
like what are some lessons to learn

374
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:02,000
and to apply forward and to improve upon

375
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,079
just across the board whether it is like

376
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,839
from a technology perspective

377
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,439
personal perspective you know

378
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,760
professional perspective

379
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,560
but i think for many of us out there

380
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,560
that's

381
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,279
you know the way i think a lot of us at

382
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,719
the first with such a dramatic change

383
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:21,200
being thrown at us um have really

384
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,399
you know worked to cope with it and i

385
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,519
think those that are

386
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,320
the csos out there like yourselves

387
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,279
um are have adapted to the change fairly

388
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,120
rapidly

389
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,880
and are really proven themselves to be

390
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,200
very strong leaders

391
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,560
and look from there you know leading

392
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,279
from the front and i would say that

393
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,399
about all

394
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,680
all three of you guys yeah

395
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,360
and one thing i would highlight from

396
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,319
that there's also a great opportunity to

397
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,160
get

398
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,560
more more closer to your team uh because

399
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,199
you lose that hey let's all go lunch

400
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,638
together

401
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,120
no one really likes to sit there and do

402
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,560
a virtual lunch with you or with anyone

403
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,120
i'm being completely honest

404
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,160
maybe once a week once a week or once

405
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,639
every other week

406
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,600
but it gives you that more one-on-one

407
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,240
time with your

408
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,920
with your specific key team members

409
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,839
instead of having that group

410
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,120
so i mean there's frozen constant to the

411
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,320
whole situation

412
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,320
uh but i do miss my slack space not the

413
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,839
tool slack i miss my own slack space

414
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,639
i i would like to like separate

415
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,519
everything um

416
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,360
well let's change topics a little bit uh

417
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,160
2020 has also been quite the year of

418
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,720
hurricanes

419
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,680
uh at the end of the day we have one

420
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,360
called beta

421
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,439
like zooming around like we ran out of

422
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,320
the alphabet from a to z

423
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,880
um which is just astounding to me uh

424
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,120
that we

425
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,880
i don't know i don't actually remember

426
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,920
the last time that happened so

427
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,760
um i've never seen a hurricane beta

428
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,719
god only knows if we end up with a

429
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,600
hurricane's data

430
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,160
that's at the end of the day but really

431
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,079
the

432
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,920
next topic is the eye of the hurricane

433
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,160
and listen to yourself

434
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,959
turn so once we've really established

435
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,199
our security programs like you guys have

436
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,959
the capabilities of our teams you know

437
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,160
start really getting things going and

438
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,359
perform

439
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,000
and i think all of us are the type a

440
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,839
where we just

441
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,079
constantly have to be moving forward and

442
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,560
figure out our next steps out there

443
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:18,479
so with enterprises out there they help

444
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,000
so you have to literally align with

445
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,240
the business goals that you have you

446
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,560
can't just keep going on your end

447
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,560
you the most effective security

448
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,880
organizations do align with

449
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,079
with their organization's business goals

450
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,760
but cyber security

451
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,359
can help you get there with a lot less

452
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,040
risk because y'all know

453
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,639
and we really have to start looking at

454
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,680
some of these new initiatives moving

455
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,560
forward

456
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,439
so kind of comparing it into the land of

457
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,680
star wars

458
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,600
like obtaining the balance of a force we

459
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,800
will need to balance effective cyber

460
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,199
security and

461
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,680
seamless operations and the task

462
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:55,199
certainly much easier than done

463
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:58,000
so with that said um joey

464
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,920
the rebels had to move vases constantly

465
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,240
to stay ahead of the empire with

466
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,959
mixed success where do you see your

467
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,279
workforce

468
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,479
operating in the next few months at home

469
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,920
in the office or

470
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,600
hybrid of the two and really are what do

471
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,560
you foresee at some new security

472
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,560
challenges

473
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,160
as you're going to maybe have some in

474
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,638
this hybrid environment

475
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,800
you know or just kind of adapting to the

476
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,639
changes that are happening out there

477
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,240
i know you've made a lot of them and

478
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,240
have adapted quite well

479
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,120
but what you know kind of look a little

480
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,959
bit of the next few months in the future

481
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,199
overall love you get your perspective

482
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,199
there

483
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,519
it's interesting i think for us so we're

484
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,639
kind of looking at the dynamic of not

485
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,199
just

486
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,720
what does it look like for us to go back

487
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,680
to the office and when

488
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,120
but because we're providing hundreds of

489
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,599
on-site wellness centers

490
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,360
for large companies you know we're also

491
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,000
working with them on their plans for how

492
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,519
they're going back

493
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,600
and when and what that means and how

494
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,480
they do it safely and what role do we

495
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,000
play in that

496
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,880
whether it's screening or testing or

497
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,519
whatever so there's a lot of dynamics

498
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,639
i think that you know we're starting to

499
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,639
see

500
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,079
the novelty is wearing off for a lot of

501
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,600
folks and they're they're kind of ready

502
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,638
to go back and people have different

503
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,480
levels of their

504
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,639
their feeling of safety around it but

505
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,240
it's kind of i think for us you know

506
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,600
it's kind of interesting we look at a

507
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,600
lot of teams raise their hand and said

508
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,079
i'm i'm perfectly happy in this work

509
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,120
from from

510
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:27,839
home thing um into perpetuity

511
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,399
but then other teams start saying yeah

512
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,920
well

513
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,920
i'm kind of i kind of need to get out of

514
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,319
this house right i mean

515
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,680
you know when we get to january um you

516
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,800
know there's either gonna february

517
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,399
there's either gonna be a whole lot of

518
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,839
babies being born or a whole lot of

519
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,360
divorce is going down right

520
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,199
it's been really either good for people

521
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,959
or stressful people and and people

522
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,479
are realizing they miss that interaction

523
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,800
and what we're seeing that's kind of the

524
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,120
neat dynamic that's playing out now

525
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,560
is where folks said they didn't want to

526
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,480
come in and then other folks are kind of

527
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,758
saying now they want to come back in

528
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,880
those team members that said they didn't

529
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,320
want to go back in are starting to

530
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,639
reconsider it and say well now i'm

531
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,920
now my now is the fomo train and am i

532
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,319
missing out on things

533
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,159
i think from a technology perspective

534
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,678
we're we're kind of prepared to support

535
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,120
it either way in the same way we were

536
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,679
when everybody had a shift really

537
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,958
quickly

538
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,959
we don't have to make a whole lot of

539
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,839
changes there um

540
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,559
but uh we do continue to have to deal

541
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,159
with

542
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:22,879
um at least on the on the provision part

543
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,720
making determinations around what kind

544
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,959
of product we're going to offer

545
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,960
uh as it best applies to the market

546
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,720
right when we went into

547
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,960
the whole pandemic we had one virtual

548
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,400
health offering now we have nearly 20.

549
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,240
right and so we're having to continue to

550
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,679
make determinations on what are the

551
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,400
things that we need to prioritize the

552
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,080
most

553
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,919
how quickly do we need to get those new

554
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,240
products stood up and then obviously you

555
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,320
know

556
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,160
the faster you try to stand up a new

557
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,600
technology the more risk you're going to

558
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,960
inherit with it and so we have to align

559
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,760
with the business on kind of what that's

560
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,840
going to be

561
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,280
and where our risk tolerance is um

562
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,199
around those things so

563
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,639
um you know it kind of continues to

564
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,640
evolve every single day i think

565
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,799
we would all agree we make decisions

566
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,760
differently now than we did in

567
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,760
the year of march

568
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:10,480
good points there uh joey um

569
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,120
ricardo lightsabers and blasters and

570
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,840
best bar

571
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,159
steel all tools have their best uses as

572
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,559
you know in certain circumstances

573
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,440
uh what new security tools are you

574
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,678
thinking about

575
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,120
moving forward with and which ones do

576
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,480
you think you've learned that you don't

577
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,479
need during the pandemic

578
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,720
well we all can't be cool like amanda

579
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,160
and be cloud

580
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:37,440
all so let me start there

581
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:40,480
uh for us it's really having the

582
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,120
tools and knowledge to be able for us to

583
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,919
operate

584
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,639
securely and safely in the cloud this

585
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,039
can be a

586
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,160
mix of cloud environmental security

587
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,760
controls aka

588
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,679
guardrails whatever you'd like to call

589
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,080
it this week uh more

590
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,799
visibility within the apis from our sas

591
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,678
vendors

592
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,160
the more that cloud visibility controls

593
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,840
with

594
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:04,400
a heavy dose of automation uh we are not

595
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,439
at any point right now where we can

596
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,880
automate the mass

597
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,280
the vast majority of our security

598
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,280
operations even from the most simplest

599
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,280
tasks so that's one of our key focus

600
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,600
over six months to really free up people

601
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,440
from the manual laborious

602
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,039
low-level tasks that could easily be

603
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,840
automated and have them work on more

604
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,280
complex issues and then we're also

605
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,159
taking a hard look at our

606
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,240
tool portfolio to understand do we have

607
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,520
single tools that only work

608
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,360
on premise um that can either be

609
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,918
migrated to a hybrid solution

610
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,559
or have a more encompassing tool set

611
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,200
that it doesn't matter where uh the data

612
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,039
resides

613
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,480
it's just ensuring that we have the

614
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,200
controls around it and those could be

615
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,080
either

616
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,799
casby or dlp whatever you want to call

617
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,600
it

618
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,799
um but but i think where we are really

619
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,360
focusing on

620
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,440
they are more of the softer software

621
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,280
yeah i must say softer software

622
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,480
and what that really means is our people

623
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,160
training so

624
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,919
this has been a great opportunity for us

625
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,200
to start clean up our legacy environment

626
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,360
and pick up mandate

627
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,360
again i'm sorry you don't have thousands

628
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,520
of years of legacy environment

629
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,199
uh but this has been a great opportunity

630
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,760
for us to take a very hard look

631
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,760
say we haven't we have not

632
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,919
decommissioned this old legacy

633
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,080
software platform because three people

634
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,400
in the entire organization do it no one

635
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,240
has ever taken initiative to clean it up

636
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,880
so this has been a great opportunity to

637
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,000
clean up

638
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,960
and modernize uh various parts of our

639
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,960
organization

640
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,159
security and non-security related but

641
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,240
this also catalysts

642
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,320
into security being an enabler for the

643
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,039
rest of it and not just being that solid

644
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,280
focus that

645
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,039
if it's not infosec we don't care we're

646
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,158
all in this together because if we

647
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,760
remove legacy

648
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,480
inherently we're also increasing our

649
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:50,240
security policy

650
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,200
wonderful um i'm kind of curious about

651
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,280
what you said

652
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:58,559
uh a regard to the on-premise

653
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,799
um aspects you know tools there

654
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,080
so is that going to be a precursor for

655
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,960
how you look at

656
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,520
evaluating moving forward any new

657
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,799
technologies in your organization

658
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:13,760
yes absolutely a perfect example is dlp

659
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,720
we have a older dlp solution that will

660
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,919
only work

661
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,320
on set shares well that that's great if

662
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,840
that's all you use but now you have one

663
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,360
drive your box you have

664
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:27,360
all this hybrid solutions across the

665
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,199
board and if the tool doesn't scale it

666
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,799
just isn't the right fit anymore

667
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,400
this has been a great opportunity to

668
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,400
take a step back and say

669
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,400
all right we have a good business case

670
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,039
for this there's a great opportunity to

671
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,120
either

672
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,320
get a new tool that has that enhanced

673
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,080
features

674
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,760
or take it out back and get rid of it

675
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,559
and have something new that can be

676
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,559
pervasive across your organization

677
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,559
okay now every tool can be ripped out

678
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,120
like that but i think those are the hard

679
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:56,158
looks that we're taking that right now

680
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,559
i mean that's really interesting um

681
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,080
so uh amanda thrawn was the most

682
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,158
strategic leader

683
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,240
in the empire ever due to his love of

684
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,559
information and fostering the talents of

685
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,760
his

686
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,720
crew how are you collaborating with your

687
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,879
business leaders

688
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,039
and your team about the next goals for

689
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,280
your company and what kind of role of

690
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,400
security have with all that and i i love

691
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,200
how you

692
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,720
have really uh when i've got have gotten

693
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,400
to know you how much you interact with

694
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,120
your team you have so much fun with your

695
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,840
team

696
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,840
actually i have fun with your team

697
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,520
but at our rising programs and stuff

698
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,480
like that

699
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,200
so you know you guys are so fun and then

700
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,159
actually with

701
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:41,360
ricardo and you uh it's not regarded you

702
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,360
guys are like the finest

703
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:47,919
[Music]

704
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,439
it's a great question um i'll say that

705
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,960
the first thing that's just

706
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,720
really pertinent to this discussion is

707
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,200
that we actually all of our meetings for

708
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,799
calder 7 are with star wars name names

709
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,640
so we have a stand up every monday

710
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:01,039
that's the mos eisley cantina talk

711
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,280
which is my background and we have some

712
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,720
other ones for strategy discussions

713
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,960
that are with my direct reports that's

714
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,880
called yavin prime and we have one on

715
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,760
ones which are hoth rebel bays like so

716
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,080
we already use

717
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,360
a lot of these and falcon debriefs and

718
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,280
things like that

719
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,799
but i think um when it comes to

720
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,879
cross-functional

721
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,400
we've got it kind of locked in in terms

722
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,760
of my team because i have

723
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,600
representatives from from these

724
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,240
different functional areas that are

725
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,120
the smes in those areas so we are

726
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:32,000
already working on our 2021 and 2022

727
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,918
strategy right now and so our roadmap is

728
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,679
like closely aligned with that

729
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,960
and our we actually have a person

730
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,799
embedded for the

731
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,240
entire product management team is

732
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,840
embedded in our team

733
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,760
so we have a lot of collaboration

734
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,199
collaboration already that goes on from

735
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,158
my team and also from across

736
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,080
functionally

737
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,440
but i actually think the business

738
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,520
leaders part

739
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,840
what's been helpful the most for me is

740
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,600
that the way we're structured

741
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,158
there's different reporting mechanisms

742
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,039
for a cso and i'm actually direct to the

743
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,440
ceo

744
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,720
so as a consequence i'm in every meeting

745
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,600
three times a week with all the other

746
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,960
executives

747
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,480
so i'm there almost as that

748
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,760
representative to hear if there's

749
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,000
something they're strategizing that

750
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,000
security needs to be embedded in more

751
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,240
so it's having that that ability that

752
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,520
contact pretty consistently

753
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,080
the other thing i actually wrote this

754
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,000
down when i was thinking about this um

755
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,199
it said what were one of like the

756
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,039
concerns uh

757
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,240
the concern i continue to bring up is

758
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,039
scaling

759
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,320
so we have issues with the fact that we

760
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,919
you know when you're more immature in

761
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,960
your program you try to throw people at

762
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,720
a problem

763
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,880
but there's a reason why automation is a

764
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,440
buzzword we won't be able to sustain

765
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,600
that

766
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,760
so we have to focus on pivoting towards

767
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,360
automation and in order to do that

768
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,799
we have to take our you know our heads

769
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,918
out of the fire hose to go do that

770
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,918
automation work

771
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,679
so we have a couple teams in our in our

772
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,240
calder 7 group that already do that but

773
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,919
we need to

774
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,360
do more of a focus on that so that's one

775
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,960
of the things that i definitely bring up

776
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,479
a lot to the company

777
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,320
and then the thing that kind of wraps

778
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,559
this all in a bow in terms of

779
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,960
strategy integration discussion with

780
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,879
other executives making sure we're aware

781
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,320
of some concerns we have and how to

782
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,840
raise those concerns

783
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,439
the last one is we actually have a tech

784
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,760
exec meeting which is

785
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,200
and it feels a little bit like i don't

786
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,480
know if anyone watches the office but it

787
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,520
feels like the four people that get

788
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,760
called in these four

789
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,360
owners of the of the property so the

790
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,480
tech exec is the cio

791
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,199
the chief product officer um our board

792
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,640
and founder

793
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,400
about board member and founder andrew

794
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,279
ceja our ceo

795
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,080
myself um so we all and also engineering

796
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,000
cto

797
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,600
so all of us come together once a week

798
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,360
for two hours and we go through

799
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,840
everything that's going on

800
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,520
and how we strategize for the future or

801
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,918
how we deal with issues currently

802
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,879
so there's collaboration is like a

803
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:45,039
really big deal for us

804
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,200
i love it that's awesome that's i mean

805
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:50,720
that's how it's supposed to work

806
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,200
so our next topic is feeling pretty

807
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,279
psyched

808
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,799
and i think i know i'm pretty psyched to

809
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,240
be with all of you today so hopefully

810
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,760
you're feeling pretty slick right now

811
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,520
i'm psyched i don't have to recite all

812
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,120
the words to the song i used to have to

813
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,400
write this outfit

814
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,879
to learn all the words so i'm just

815
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:08,080
psyched i don't have to sing it

816
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,159
fair enough fair fair fair enough

817
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,360
i think we should close with that song

818
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,440
oh yeah oh

819
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,639
okay well we'll have to see that up

820
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,919
somehow but um

821
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,320
i have to tell you a funny thing about

822
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:21,919
the song though that was the prom

823
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:24,720
my high school prom song

824
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,720
yeah yeah it was kind of well it was a

825
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,559
little depressing at the time but

826
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,799
i thought it was a weird it wasn't a

827
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,520
shmoopy song it'd be your last dance too

828
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,039
but

829
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,639
it ended up working out everyone just

830
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,879
sort of jumped around but it was pretty

831
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,880
fun

832
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,200
um in a dark place where we find

833
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,520
ourselves a little more knowledge lights

834
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,720
in our way than one particularly famous

835
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,559
jedi master our dark place as we all

836
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,760
know in cyber security was the beginning

837
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,559
of the pandemic

838
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,200
but since then we have gained a lot more

839
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,240
knowledge

840
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,720
about security platforms as well as

841
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,880
insights into our solutions and what you

842
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,640
know really reaching the potential and

843
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,679
exceeding the potential

844
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,400
of our teams i've been amazed at my

845
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,799
shame

846
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,799
um and how and hearing from all of you

847
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,840
how your teams have been amazing and

848
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,840
pivoted and um you know when we're

849
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,279
put forth with a lot of different

850
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,480
hardships and challenges

851
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,679
uh we've persevered and really these

852
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,399
patches of light

853
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,039
are leading our way uh to the future and

854
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,000
we're really

855
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,720
i think even in a better position now to

856
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,279
make better

857
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,559
and more informed security decisions

858
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,679
maybe even before

859
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:37,678
uh in march but how we prepare

860
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,039
is going to make a difference so we have

861
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:40,399
to think about it from our outlook

862
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,840
perspective

863
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:47,039
so amanda this is a question for you

864
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,799
if princess leah had the cloud it might

865
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,039
have been easier to send the death star

866
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,960
plans to the rebels how should

867
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,799
enterprises prepare to use cloud

868
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,000
infrastructure and applications in the

869
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,600
coming months

870
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,080
and what do you think are some of the

871
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,320
new best practices that have emerged

872
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,360
in defining data storage and protection

873
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,760
policies

874
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,678
regarding the cloud there's no way to

875
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,080
start this without at least the quote

876
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,240
that

877
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,399
was it lando says you truly belong with

878
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,240
us here among the clouds like this is

879
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,879
those moments but

880
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,880
uh i think that what's been beneficial

881
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,320
with moving to the remote workforce in

882
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,000
the cloud infrastructure it's

883
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,080
we already knew that the reason it was

884
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,039
an attractive concept is the agility for

885
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,199
deployment

886
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,320
and scaling and so on and access from

887
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,799
around the world

888
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,678
but i think that probably the most

889
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,440
important part for

890
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,000
for preparation was identity access

891
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,480
management who's touching what when

892
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,399
how why are they supposed to is it just

893
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,679
in time access for something whenever

894
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,439
they're getting involved

895
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,520
so i think it was it was something that

896
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,720
really helped security teams like refine

897
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,120
what they were already

898
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,559
moving towards at least for for my case

899
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,239
i feel like we already had a cloud team

900
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,639
that was really focused on this

901
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,320
we also had um the ability to really

902
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,679
launch off the protection in the cloud

903
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,279
that was made pretty strong with our

904
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,600
partnership with microsoft

905
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,760
so i think there's a lot to be found

906
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,799
there with the telemetry of the cloud

907
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,960
not just for relativity one not just for

908
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,639
microsoft but just across the entire

909
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,200
board of the threat landscape

910
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,039
there became so many new new things that

911
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,880
were happening that were not great

912
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,080
um and a lot of different spinning up of

913
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,080
new campaigns

914
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,760
trying to really get you know past

915
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,520
things with the antiquated phishing

916
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,120
attacks that still come out

917
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,559
so like all of these things were still

918
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,399
going to happen and they increased but

919
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,039
they allowed our security team to become

920
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,760
much more

921
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,039
effective and like fine tune detections

922
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,919
and capabilities with our access

923
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,360
management

924
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,520
and i think that's what we really

925
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,959
struggle for to double down on quickly

926
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,879
and i think that's what i've seen as a

927
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,559
trend that that's the same concepts that

928
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,840
other people have been focusing on so

929
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,600
i'll like i'll actually toss that to

930
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,158
joey and ricardo is that also your

931
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,840
experience

932
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,039
yeah i i actually i was i was just kind

933
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,639
of sitting here contemplating that you

934
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,480
know it's it's been interesting as we

935
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,880
went into the pandemic i think

936
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,960
um collaboration like you said is super

937
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,039
important and

938
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,799
two years ago you know i i kind of keep

939
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,240
a rolling like two year roadmap because

940
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,918
tech's moving so fast that it's like

941
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,360
hard to do much longer than that

942
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,960
but when i went to my board i said look

943
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,760
the three pillars that this is going to

944
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,919
be built on

945
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,960
for the next several years are data

946
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,480
centricity

947
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,760
identity and automation and

948
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,120
orchestration right everything's going

949
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,440
to kind of fall into those things and

950
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,039
it's

951
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,720
you know so we put tools in place but

952
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,720
once the whole workforce kind of went

953
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,480
remote um

954
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,919
the rest of the business stakeholders

955
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,200
kind of started to get that they

956
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,880
understood the message a little bit

957
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,480
better now they're like oh i get it

958
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,000
i understand what you mean when you talk

959
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,559
about identity as a perimeter like you

960
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,559
said you know

961
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,080
we're looking at whether you're doing it

962
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,720
with microsoft or whatever

963
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,799
the ability to kind of innately tag data

964
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,279
apply policy to it and then and then

965
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,360
have that map across an ecosphere

966
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,120
um with a singular kind of rule set it

967
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,240
you know it it empowers us to do things

968
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,760
differently whereas

969
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,360
you know record you were talking about

970
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,799
like traditional dlp like we saw the

971
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,559
same thing we kind of moved away from

972
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,000
our network-based dlp while because

973
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,760
the traffic just wasn't flowing through

974
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,880
there you know when we went through this

975
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,000
automation routines had to be

976
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,760
reevaluated because

977
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,120
they were automating based on

978
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,720
assumptions of workflows

979
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,320
going traffic patterns that weren't

980
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,840
happening anymore right and so

981
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,279
this we would see like sometimes it's

982
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,240
not just the alerts and stuff you see

983
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,840
it's the stuff that you

984
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,880
you're seeing not popping anymore and

985
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,399
you're going hey why aren't we seeing

986
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,600
any noise there or any volume and you're

987
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,678
like oh we gotta go

988
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,199
you know re-architect the the automation

989
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,640
routine which is kind of like

990
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,080
automation is great and you can't keep

991
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,799
throwing people at it but like then you

992
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,399
got to realize

993
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,158
once you start automating things then

994
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,399
you've got to manage the automation

995
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,679
ecoseer as well so because that that

996
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,879
takes a lot of tlc

997
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,559
we saw a lot of that but it's but it's

998
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,200
been great and it's it's really helped

999
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:37,440
the organization to understand

1000
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,559
um i think the broader organization to

1001
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,960
understand

1002
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:43,039
the criticality of the im function and

1003
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,799
and how much that identity matters and

1004
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,879
how much it empowers them right to be

1005
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,639
able to really be able to uh be

1006
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,519
adaptable and flexible and do anything

1007
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,360
they want

1008
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,120
um with what they're providing them so

1009
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,000
that's been that's been fun to to kind

1010
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,678
of go through

1011
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,279
if you try to lock anything down too

1012
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,640
much with process or anything

1013
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,240
you'll realize that people will quickly

1014
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,919
find a different way to access it it's

1015
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,440
not going to take that process so

1016
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,200
you have to make it as streamlined as

1017
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,840
possible

1018
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,960
one last thing i'm saying the learning

1019
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,840
perspective

1020
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,399
is just on the grc teams a lot you know

1021
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,559
they are used to evaluating controls and

1022
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:18,158
criteria based on on-prem technologies

1023
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,000
and be and having to get them to

1024
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,640
understand um

1025
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,559
risk scenarios around apis and and

1026
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,000
devops and and how those things kind of

1027
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,480
are in a different world they're like

1028
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,159
well

1029
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,519
when was the last time you rebooted the

1030
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,120
server it's like we're not having that

1031
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,039
conversation anymore folks

1032
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,199
so so that's been kind of a learning

1033
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:38,320
curve

1034
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,880
so luke has been a little short as we

1035
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,678
all know

1036
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,000
to be a storm trooper but the imperials

1037
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,080
should

1038
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,120
have noticed that how are you guys

1039
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,799
approaching the

1040
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,439
identity of verification and

1041
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:52,240
authentication since the users

1042
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,080
of attackers can really be anywhere now

1043
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,200
just like our end users there could be

1044
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,158
anywhere

1045
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,360
what about passwords mfa zero trust is

1046
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,600
it enough and

1047
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,840
why or why not who wants to tackle that

1048
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,840
one

1049
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:10,720
i'll start sure why not why not

1050
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,678
uh so identity is core i we just had

1051
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,159
this conversation

1052
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:16,080
it all starts with the identity and i

1053
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,960
don't wanna say it's not enough but

1054
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,918
mfa zero trust it's all you want to just

1055
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,320
make it that much

1056
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,600
incrementally harder to get to whatever

1057
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,320
you call your crown jewels

1058
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,879
if you even want to put acls that's fine

1059
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,000
it's just

1060
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,000
those stacking controls that need to be

1061
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,679
maintainable going back to what you said

1062
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,200
joey there's a lot of tlc

1063
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,720
you want to be able to automate as much

1064
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,640
of those controls as possible

1065
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,320
and adding mfa that's fine the bad guys

1066
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,600
will find ways to get around

1067
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:45,279
mfa how many people in the audience yes

1068
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,678
virtual audience still have basic

1069
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:49,760
authentication on your office 365

1070
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,799
i mean there's always these little holes

1071
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,279
ws trust

1072
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:55,120
so on and so forth it's how you build a

1073
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,559
program and how you react

1074
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,039
to your threats you need to make sure

1075
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:01,360
that your program isn't stuck in stone

1076
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,399
and it's fluid and dynamic based on the

1077
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,479
threat landscape

1078
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:06,080
so i think taking that approach is a lot

1079
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,199
more effective than saying

1080
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:12,078
all right this year we're doing a uh

1081
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:14,158
eight-month project to implement mfa

1082
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,679
next two years we'll do zero trust only

1083
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,599
on these core items

1084
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,280
it's really taking that step back and

1085
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,280
prioritizing

1086
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,200
where your highest risk areas are and

1087
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,079
put in tools and processes that are

1088
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:26,560
automated identity driven and being able

1089
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,280
to be

1090
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,000
fluid as the threats change i know it

1091
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,560
sounds like this

1092
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,719
perfect utopia but if you build it right

1093
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,239
you can have these incremental modular

1094
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:38,319
processes in your program

1095
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:41,040
that do not take a behemoth of a project

1096
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,040
to implement

1097
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,520
i would agree uh with what you're saying

1098
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,719
joey or

1099
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,480
amanda i'll let joey go first okay

1100
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,399
yeah i mean i wouldn't disagree with any

1101
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,599
of that the the the thing that i would

1102
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,199
add on to it i was kind of

1103
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,440
thinking and recording you you kind of

1104
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:00,640
dropped off your last statement

1105
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:04,240
um at the same place which was basically

1106
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:06,319
you know is it is it enough well no i

1107
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,640
mean it's it's it's never enough to get

1108
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,760
to

1109
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,440
to zero risk right but you know it's not

1110
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,720
about being at zero risk right it's

1111
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,240
about identifying what are the things

1112
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,799
that are intolerable to accept risk

1113
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,319
around

1114
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,240
and protecting those and helping the

1115
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,440
business to understand what that is and

1116
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,479
where you've prioritized and where

1117
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,839
you've put things you know

1118
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,200
um my my workflow uh with our exact same

1119
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,759
ad is similar to what you described we

1120
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,919
meet

1121
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,160
now we meet daily but we all of us meet

1122
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:33,200
at least once a week for a couple hours

1123
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,720
um a security myself and my vps are

1124
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,480
deeply embedded in our growth team and

1125
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,680
growth strategy for what verticals and

1126
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,240
what new pursuits we're going to go

1127
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,839
after

1128
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,160
and having that visibility with those

1129
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:45,119
teams helps them to understand hey

1130
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,319
let's not architect a security control

1131
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,280
solution that's going to take us 12

1132
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,560
months to implement

1133
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,640
when the project's only going to run for

1134
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,000
nine months to begin with right so

1135
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,078
having those kind of things helps us say

1136
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,520
hey we got something we the the business

1137
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,119
criteria is we've got to move quick

1138
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,640
we've got to move fast

1139
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,240
we've got to be able to deliver on these

1140
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,040
things and we say okay if that's the

1141
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,799
case then

1142
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,400
you're gonna have to be able to accept

1143
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,119
moving at this level of risk it's like

1144
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,720
the

1145
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,800
race car scenario i say sometimes right

1146
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,399
i mean you can put as many security and

1147
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,359
and safety controls on a race car as you

1148
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,480
want but eventually you're going to

1149
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,720
weigh it down and it's never going to

1150
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,320
achieve its mission of winning the race

1151
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,480
it won't crash and nobody'll die but you

1152
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,720
also won't ever win so you know

1153
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,480
it's kind of like that way of going

1154
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,640
about and aligning with the business

1155
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,839
is is really where you kind of get the

1156
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:30,640
efficacy of it

1157
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,359
so han solo as we all know wasn't too

1158
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,759
happy about

1159
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,759
stepping up and getting entangled into a

1160
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,800
rebellion that was sort of his way in

1161
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,760
nature

1162
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,200
but he did actually become still one of

1163
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,440
the top generals

1164
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,279
so i would love to get your your

1165
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,520
thoughts here are you grimacing at the

1166
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,000
challenges that are in front of you or

1167
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,200
are you still psyched about the

1168
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,520
opportunities

1169
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,118
that are headed your way so amanda do

1170
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,440
you want to start

1171
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,440
yeah i mean the reluctant hero sounds

1172
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,400
like every major person in security i've

1173
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,599
ever met so it's

1174
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,200
a mythos that works really well um but i

1175
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,640
actually would say and i'm gonna take a

1176
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,640
guess that though this will be

1177
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,799
across the board everyone would agree

1178
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,279
this is like what we came here to do

1179
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,040
you know was to solve security problems

1180
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,560
and candidly it gets a little boring

1181
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,520
when you've done a really great defense

1182
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,680
in-depth job

1183
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,119
at any of these places um and any of the

1184
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,118
places i've worked at previously if you

1185
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,800
have a really great security program

1186
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,400
it's like okay what do we do now

1187
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,000
everything's working great

1188
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,320
then covet happens or something to that

1189
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,079
effect so i think it's uh one of those

1190
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,920
things that we all like to

1191
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,320
be involved to solve these really

1192
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,240
difficult problems and to rise up those

1193
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,359
successors like the sith lord is always

1194
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,200
having too

1195
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,880
so that you know that somebody can take

1196
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,879
your place and who can still do a good

1197
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,400
job with this program so

1198
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,599
i think that's what we're all here to do

1199
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,440
is to solve these kind of problems and

1200
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,200
we've all probably reluctantly like

1201
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,760
maybe grumble about vm

1202
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,799
or processes for secure by design etc

1203
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,480
but in the end

1204
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,880
we're here to do that and i think we

1205
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,880
enjoy it

1206
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,160
what about you or cargo oh i couldn't

1207
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,280
agree more

1208
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:08,640
of course um right

1209
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,680
i i actually thrive in chaos and i love

1210
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,078
uncertainty

1211
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,799
i didn't i could not predicted this at

1212
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,480
all

1213
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,520
but it adds a little uh dynamic and

1214
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,119
change to the

1215
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,920
monotony even though security is a

1216
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:23,599
monotonous in general but you have your

1217
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,000
fishing you have your

1218
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,880
drive-by downloads whatever you want to

1219
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,359
call it

1220
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,000
this is a new territory for all of us

1221
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,799
this isn't

1222
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,760
like oh we're doing our annual br bcp

1223
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,480
test no this like

1224
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,680
infinite dr bcp test right now in

1225
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,680
perpetuity

1226
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,040
and i think it's it's really exciting

1227
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,279
and being able to be

1228
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,440
closer to the business uh through this

1229
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:48,800
time has been really enlightening for me

1230
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,480
and actually seeing the controls and

1231
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,320
how you work so collaboratively with the

1232
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,400
business to have that outcome

1233
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,000
and see it to fruition i think is really

1234
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,160
exciting and i think that's

1235
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,280
at the end of the day security's a

1236
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,480
business enabler

1237
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:05,280
and seeing it actually have tangible

1238
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,680
outcomes is really exciting for me

1239
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,960
i agree joey what about you final

1240
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,799
thoughts

1241
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,400
yeah i mean of course right totally

1242
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,200
aligned i mean this is this is what we

1243
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,720
came here to do

1244
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,480
this is what we live for but you know

1245
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,919
for us it's been an interesting journey

1246
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,839
i mean

1247
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,079
we're going into risk scenarios where

1248
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,920
you know technology risk is is just one

1249
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,440
of the risks right i mean we've got

1250
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,119
we've got thousands of frontline health

1251
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,160
care providers out there working for us

1252
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,599
and we need to empower them

1253
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,279
we need to empower them to be able to

1254
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,640
leverage technology securely they're

1255
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,040
they're out there on the front lines you

1256
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,640
know

1257
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,160
putting themselves in harm's way doing

1258
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,319
doing code testing for people

1259
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,598
trying to trying to take care of folks

1260
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,280
who are sick and

1261
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,040
you know it's there's there's a lot of

1262
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,560
risk in that there's execution risk

1263
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,240
there's financial risk there's also

1264
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,200
security risk and so

1265
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,759
you know our job as leaders is to help

1266
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,759
you know

1267
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,839
uh illuminate the risk more than it is

1268
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,440
to eliminate the risk sometimes right

1269
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:58,078
and so uh so yeah i mean that's that

1270
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,119
that's what we're here for game on right

1271
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:02,000
everyone's got to play until they get

1272
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:04,400
punched in the face absolutely we're all

1273
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,400
