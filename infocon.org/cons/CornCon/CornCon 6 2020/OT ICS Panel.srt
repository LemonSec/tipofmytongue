1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,280
a wonderful panel with with maggie jory

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,600
and megan uh

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,960
and and you know part of what we wanted

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,520
to do this morning is talk a little bit

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,920
about

6
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,120
um you know what we do in the field ics

7
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,559
and ot is a

8
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,320
is a very interesting space it's

9
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,518
relatively new for for many security

10
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,039
folks out there

11
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,320
and so i wanted to kind of go down the

12
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,760
line with each of these panelists and

13
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,000
talk a little bit about

14
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,680
what their experience is what they do

15
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,198
within ics ot

16
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,000
and maybe talk about you know what does

17
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,480
ics and ot mean to them

18
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,599
and so uh to kind of kick this off megan

19
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,360
would you like to

20
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,880
talk a little bit about you know what

21
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,920
your role is what you do

22
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,920
and what ics no team means to you yeah

23
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,559
absolutely thank you tony and it's good

24
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,280
to be here uh with everyone today

25
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,440
so uh gosh it's like where to start i

26
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,960
can talk about my current role so i'm

27
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,800
the vice president uh

28
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,719
chief product security officer for the

29
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,000
energy management business within

30
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,800
schneider electric

31
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,079
and i am responsible for the wing to

32
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,718
wing product security

33
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,440
program so kind of a you know maybe a

34
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,680
little bit

35
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,479
of an oversimplified way that i explain

36
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,720
it is that

37
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,200
i think of product security in a

38
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,760
traditional sense in two sides of a coin

39
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,119
and that it is the standards the

40
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,360
security uh

41
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,439
requirements the testing and the

42
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,840
validation the secure development life

43
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,600
cycle the pen testing static analysis

44
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,799
kind of all of those great things that

45
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,199
we do to ensure

46
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,320
that we ship a secure product on one

47
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,240
side of the coin

48
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,839
and the flip side of the coin is where

49
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,360
things get really interesting from a

50
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,479
business standpoint and that

51
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,119
we get to select security features that

52
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,119
we believe will delight the customer and

53
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,159
make their security experience

54
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,520
uh better by designing security into the

55
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,840
product so think of things like

56
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,079
certificate authority and secure boot

57
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,920
and and other mechanisms event logging

58
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,919
for example in controllers uh

59
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,680
things that have existed within the it

60
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,880
world for quite some time

61
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,320
we get to make choices from

62
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,039
a business and kind of a a customer

63
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,479
um you know satisfaction and product

64
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,240
quality standpoint

65
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,160
to build those things directly into the

66
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,239
product so um

67
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,840
i'd say product security is different

68
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,400
than i t security

69
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,280
in the sense that i t is really

70
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,239
concerned with

71
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,480
protecting the entire enterprise network

72
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,720
the intellectual property

73
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,920
the users on the network your

74
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,000
traditional i.t

75
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,839
interactions your sock analyst kind of

76
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,640
monitoring for threats coming into that

77
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,519
network

78
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,640
and product security is really where the

79
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,160
rubber reached the

80
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,319
meets the road and what is possible in

81
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,359
differentiating

82
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,200
a company in today's world when it comes

83
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,200
to what it provides

84
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,119
in terms of products services and

85
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,720
everything that it wants to offer to it

86
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,160
to its customers so

87
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,920
i think that i'm trying to think of

88
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,760
something catchy to say that i'm not

89
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,000
that clever this morning and that

90
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,160
product security has all the cool things

91
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,080
of it with the twist of being a little

92
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,120
bit business savvy and a little bit more

93
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,599
customer focused

94
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,840
and i'd say that a little bit more is

95
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,280
normally writing on the line and that

96
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,599
what you produce

97
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,040
uh you're ultimately accountable for

98
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,238
because it's going to be living in a

99
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,720
different environment

100
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,000
and from the time that product ships

101
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,920
until the time that that

102
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,280
product is living in the customer

103
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:22,720
environment and ultimately uh

104
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,440
disposed of and uh you know all of those

105
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,000
things and

106
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,440
to the point that it's no longer used

107
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,400
the risk to that product

108
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,959
we can expect to exponentially increase

109
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,360
so

110
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,599
you've got one shot to do it right when

111
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,280
the product is still in your environment

112
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,798
and then of course you can do patches

113
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,640
and things like that and provide

114
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,319
services around the life cycle of the

115
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,518
product once it's in the customer

116
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,599
environment but

117
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,040
it's so important to do as much as you

118
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,000
can on the front end

119
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,400
and kind of uh looking into that crystal

120
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,640
ball

121
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,319
trying to protect trying to predict the

122
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,439
future threats that may come against

123
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,200
that product

124
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,480
and doing everything that you possibly

125
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,798
can from the onset

126
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,959
so it's it's a tremendously large world

127
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,080
with tremendously

128
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,879
cool challenges and opportunities and

129
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,680
um delights and frustrations on a daily

130
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,200
basis but

131
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,959
i love it and i wouldn't change it for

132
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,719
the world yeah

133
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,759
thank you megan uh jerry can you tell us

134
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,799
a little bit about you know your

135
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,160
background and what you

136
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:24,719
what you do in the icsot security space

137
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,759
absolutely so i have a a long and sordid

138
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,479
past

139
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,280
i actually started out uh in on the i.t

140
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,680
side of the house

141
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,880
many many years ago as a bench tech kind

142
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,680
of worked my way up

143
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,800
uh into architecture system design and

144
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,800
networks and

145
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,560
that naturally led me over to security

146
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,880
and i've been in security for the last

147
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,800
15 years

148
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,919
i would say that the first half of my

149
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,800
career was

150
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,599
called ot adjacent and the second half

151
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,720
of my career

152
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,120
was really focused on ot and ics i made

153
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,639
a move to the dark side

154
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,120
probably about nine years ago uh which i

155
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,039
would call

156
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,160
uh technical sales uh or sales

157
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,800
engineering

158
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,000
um for vendor the vendor space and i've

159
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,759
worked for companies such as

160
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,280
uh fireeye crowdstrike uh and

161
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,680
um really i i'm way more of a geek than

162
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,758
i am

163
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,919
a vp of sales it's hard to read that

164
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:22,800
title

165
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:26,719
um as far as ics and ot to me i think uh

166
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,600
it always goes back to utilities and um

167
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,800
physical physical things uh there's a

168
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,080
little bit of wonderment for me

169
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,360
anytime that i walk into a large um

170
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,359
we'll say energy

171
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,880
like a dam for example i mean there's

172
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,880
bolts the size of my head

173
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,159
that's amazing the way that these things

174
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,000
work uh

175
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,440
and the systems that protect them are or

176
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,639
i should say run them and protect them

177
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,320
are really interesting as well just

178
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,520
because of the uh

179
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,719
amount of simplicity

180
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,520
uh but also complexity in those

181
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,840
environments and i think

182
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,120
as a whole security is really challenged

183
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,280
around

184
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,120
that simplicity itself uh people think

185
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,080
that that ics is complicated in a way as

186
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,000
it can be but

187
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,919
a lot of the systems that we look at as

188
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,520
a whole are

189
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,198
they're very simple i mean a lot of the

190
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,359
basic controllers that we see it's

191
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,520
ladder logic

192
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,880
authentication isn't a thing it doesn't

193
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,479
exist

194
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,560
so it takes a much more

195
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,919
thought out approach to securing those

196
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,160
environments

197
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:39,359
and let's say ramifications or

198
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,759
impact is felt a lot more inside ics and

199
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,039
ot

200
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,400
than you see in some of the it

201
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,280
environments and i don't want to say

202
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,638
that money isn't

203
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,400
necessarily an important part of

204
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,199
everyone's life but

205
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,960
when we see amex for example saying if i

206
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,080
have a server go down

207
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,758
it cost me x dollars a day or x dollars

208
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,000
an hour even x dollars a minute

209
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,560
that's an impact that we see when you

210
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,120
see a power generation site go down

211
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,479
and you see a section of the grid or

212
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,240
rolling brownouts

213
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,440
throughout a city that's a physical

214
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,440
impact people feel that you see it

215
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,039
it's something that i think really

216
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,759
resonates with people more than anything

217
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,120
else

218
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,720
and i will say uh in my technical career

219
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,639
i have been described as the computer

220
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,360
guy so many times i

221
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,440
i can't even uh i can't even count when

222
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,960
i started actually working on ics and ot

223
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,039
systems i immediately

224
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,680
it immediately changed because you can

225
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,400
uh for example my mother-in-law can say

226
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,080
my son-in-law protects our energy and it

227
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,679
immediately resonates with people

228
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,680
over being the computer guy

229
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,000
how would you guys define ics i mean

230
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,400
just for the just for the the audience

231
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,120
today

232
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,120
what what is ics and and what is ot

233
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,919
hot topic uh i think we're probably

234
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,280
going to debate this because

235
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,359
it depends on how you look at it i see

236
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,119
it as circles ot really is

237
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,479
kind of an expansive circle an umbrella

238
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,919
that covers everything

239
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,520
ics and some of the other systems that

240
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,318
we have in there specific to scada for

241
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,719
example

242
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,479
are within that ot that operations

243
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,199
technology bucket

244
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,318
i kind of see ot is the easiest way to

245
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,080
describe it is

246
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:19,919
i.t assets in an ics environment

247
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,639
okay yeah and you know people talk about

248
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,599
the term

249
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,720
um scada you know scada you know how do

250
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,560
you how do you

251
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,680
how do you see scada and how it fits

252
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,719
with those those different circles

253
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,120
scada is only one small uh it's it's

254
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,080
really only one small portion of ics and

255
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,760
ot as a whole

256
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,159
and in fact most of the systems that

257
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,240
see on a day-to-day basis aren't using

258
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,160
scada

259
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,600
they might be part of a scada

260
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,600
environment

261
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,040
but they're not necessarily that's not

262
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,080
the whole sum of it honestly they're

263
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,399
very very i would say

264
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,760
30 of what i see on a day is actually

265
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,920
scada which is very very

266
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,920
uh it's very focused on

267
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,680
that's a hard one i'm trying to i'm

268
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,000
trying to think of how to separate it

269
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,279
for

270
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,959
uh from a systems perspective so it's

271
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,760
really around that supervisory in

272
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,800
control

273
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,680
it is only specific to uh the operation

274
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,359
of a device

275
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,719
if that makes sense so it's a very low

276
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,399
level and a lot of times when we

277
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:28,480
when we talk scada we're talking serial

278
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:30,880
this isn't ip connected uh technologies

279
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,800
so um you know when you guys look at

280
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,000
your jobs i mean megan you have a

281
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,240
slightly different perspective you know

282
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
you're really building security in

283
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,680
george you're really helping it sounds

284
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,519
like you're really helping to to offer

285
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,760
solutions to market to secure

286
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,279
their install base to secure their

287
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,399
overall systems and

288
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,480
and so um you know it sounds like that's

289
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,800
a very collaborative nature

290
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,720
how do you guys see the the need for

291
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,479
built-in versus bolt-on i know that's a

292
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,200
very controversial topic

293
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,760
when people talk about cyber security um

294
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,000
when you think ics ot what nuances are

295
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,200
there of built-in versus bolt-on and

296
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,959
how do you see those things coming

297
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,560
together and what are some of the things

298
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,959
that they should be really looking for

299
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,599
in some of these solutions or products i

300
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:17,119
guess megan i'll start with you

301
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:19,440
uh sure so i i think that

302
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,640
it's helpful to scope the conversation

303
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,920
in terms of what

304
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:26,079
ics vendors and scada providers uh

305
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,760
provide unto themselves like what

306
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,399
what is their bread and butter what are

307
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,760
they traditionally really good at making

308
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:37,600
whether those are uh plc's

309
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,640
controllers uh hmis sensors kind of the

310
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,320
bread and butter

311
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,720
whether you're in a process or a

312
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,040
discrete environment that make up

313
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,480
uh what you know and googled if if

314
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,760
you're not familiar with it the purdue

315
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,200
model we speak the language of the

316
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,200
purdue model where

317
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,200
um level five is more like your

318
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,000
enterprise company-wide i.t

319
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,880
network and you're moving down into uh

320
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,279
the dmz

321
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,600
zones where the networks are hopefully

322
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,320
uh segmentated a good amount

323
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,040
and you get into uh process control

324
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,040
level four

325
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,319
level three with your hmis and your

326
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,719
traditional scada

327
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,800
and you move down uh down from there

328
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,279
into level two and level one devices

329
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,920
and that is that is our world that is

330
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,800
what

331
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,599
um what we're really good at providing

332
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,920
um

333
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,920
and we can build security into those

334
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,000
products to be able to kind of have wing

335
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,199
to wing secure communications that's a

336
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,360
big topic that we're

337
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,880
that we're all kind of moving towards uh

338
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,000
these environments exist

339
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,600
for 10 20 years so you know eric would

340
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,440
eric byers would say we're not going to

341
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,800
rip and replace this equipment anytime

342
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,160
soon it's meant to be there it's

343
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,399
functioning it's uh

344
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,480
it's doing their job it's producing corn

345
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,640
flakes or it's producing

346
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,760
uh you know energy for the grid or it's

347
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,760
controlling a dam

348
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,839
these things are built to last and it

349
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,160
speaks to the quality of the products

350
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,920
um and we can build it in right and we

351
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,920
can patch and we can do things after the

352
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,680
fact to help the customer but

353
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,240
there are some areas like intrusion

354
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,519
detection systems ids

355
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,040
and if you look at clarity or dragos or

356
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,079
nozomi where

357
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,560
they provide a specialty product that

358
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,599
that that company built that device to

359
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,239
be able to

360
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,320
analyze network traffic and detect

361
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,959
anomalous behavior on that network in

362
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,000
other words

363
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,680
activities and actions or something that

364
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,079
is not supposed to be there

365
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,760
and they're going to alert the customer

366
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,160
that that something bad is in their

367
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,639
environment so that they can hopefully

368
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,719
take action on that and uh and do things

369
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,519
in a safe way to remediate that issue

370
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,600
and so there is a unique skill set that

371
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,600
is involved in providing this type of

372
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,480
service especially when it comes down to

373
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,600
incident response and fly away teams and

374
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,760
being able to

375
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,200
you know if a customer goes down and

376
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,600
they may not know for an

377
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,720
hour to that cyber has anything to do

378
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,639
with the situation

379
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,079
all they know is that something uh

380
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,680
something is what i call

381
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:01,199
jdlr uh just doesn't look right okay

382
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,439
and they're gonna pick up the phone and

383
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,120
they're gonna start uh making some phone

384
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,079
calls and when that happens you know i

385
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,560
think that it's great

386
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:12,079
that there are companies out there like

387
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,239
clarity nozomi and dragos that provide

388
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,920
the technology to help them detect these

389
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,839
issues and get visibility onto their

390
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,360
network as well as to know

391
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,800
when jdlr is really apt

392
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,800
right when you when you have something

393
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,560
more nefarious in there and in many

394
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,359
cases you may be dealing with kind of

395
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,479
commodity hacking issues like ransomware

396
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,399
or

397
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,000
viruses that get on the system because

398
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,480
of kind of poor system hygiene

399
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,240
but in those unique cases where it is

400
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,120
something more targeted um

401
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,320
you need to you need to bring in the

402
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,480
experts if you will

403
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,800
to to help you with that issue and to

404
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,639
kick the bad guys out and hopefully

405
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,479
plug the holes up in your network so

406
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:54,399
that that doesn't happen again and

407
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,560
vendors can work ahead of time with um

408
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,240
these ics security advisors to kind of

409
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,599
create customized solutions for the

410
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,240
customers and then

411
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,760
you know hope it doesn't happen but you

412
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,560
know knock on wood if something does

413
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,880
happen

414
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,800
you can work afterwards uh running

415
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,519
responses and things like that together

416
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,719
and coming up with creative solutions to

417
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,959
make sure that that type of thing

418
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,040
doesn't impact your customer again

419
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,680
so that's kind of my perspective what do

420
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,000
you what do you think jory

421
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,880
i think as a whole it's it's really an

422
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,639
ecosystem

423
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,880
uh so it's not just the vendors that we

424
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,720
have and and the responders but

425
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,480
when we get to actual product specific

426
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,680
things that you can do all the way down

427
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,920
to the controller

428
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,439
it it really does matter it goes all the

429
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,760
way to the people as well i mean

430
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,160
it it's probably a little cliche and

431
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,439
overused but if i bought an alarm system

432
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,399
for my house

433
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,920
and left the front door open it's not

434
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,680
very helpful

435
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,040
uh so i think it's important that we all

436
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,680
work together the

437
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,199
the systems themselves have to be secure

438
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,760
the individuals who are using those

439
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,719
systems

440
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,040
need to understand uh the risk of what

441
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,120
their impact is how they use that system

442
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,880
and how they can just in their daily

443
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,760
tasks be more secure

444
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,480
as well as the uh we'll call bolt-on

445
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,959
products

446
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,279
i think especially in ics because the

447
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,119
systems themselves as megan said there's

448
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,199
some of them are set to run for 30 to 40

449
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,320
years these are solutions that are built

450
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,519
and not touched ever again unless

451
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,760
something breaks

452
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,920
they don't touch these systems so it's

453
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,360
not like they're regularly patched or

454
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,120
anything along those lines and when you

455
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,079
get into systems where authentication

456
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,079
isn't the thing

457
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,920
uh you know systems that are running

458
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:35,758
windows xp or

459
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,759
god forbid in some cases windows nt

460
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,759
there's not much you can do other than

461
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,759
to properly segment

462
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,360
using the purdue model is a great way to

463
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,320
do that to segment your critical

464
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,639
environments

465
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,800
and to definitely disconnect your it

466
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:52,959
from your ot

467
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,880
in as much of a physical manner as you

468
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,399
can uh

469
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,320
but the the vendor products i think that

470
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,920
are really important around visibility

471
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,000
because when you're inside that space

472
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,800
it's not about i'm gonna go patch

473
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,199
an nt box it's not about i'm going to go

474
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,560
upgrade the firmware on a plc that's

475
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,800
you know running a safety system for a

476
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,479
generation environment it is about

477
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,479
understanding the communications in

478
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,600
between them how they're interacting

479
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,199
with each other

480
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,720
uh and if you see things that are odd

481
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,439
which i think gets into a whole other

482
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,040
debate around anomaly detection versus

483
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,720
signatures and so on and so forth but

484
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,079
really visibility as a whole it doesn't

485
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,759
matter if it's anomaly or just

486
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,399
generalized data

487
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,360
all of it is helpful to understand

488
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,399
what's going on in

489
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,560
inside that environment

490
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,920
lots of great nuggets in there i think

491
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,839
when you look at

492
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,680
the install base that we're talking

493
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,440
about you know 30 40 years you know

494
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,359
that's that is not uncommon

495
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,440
you know to go rip and replaces you know

496
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,880
billions if not trillions of dollars of

497
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,600
investment

498
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,439
just just given the usage of these

499
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,560
technologies and i think

500
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,600
you know joy the way you said you know

501
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,800
the way you talked earlier about those

502
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,279
large bolts right

503
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,240
people that built these systems 20 30

504
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,880
years ago

505
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,839
really thought of these technologies as

506
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,760
another bolt

507
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,198
another mechanical device that you fix

508
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,280
it when you replace it

509
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,720
it wasn't associated with that i.t

510
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,480
equipment right and so

511
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,319
it wasn't given that the same life cycle

512
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,039
it wasn't given that same governance and

513
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,799
so

514
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,640
um that's really been a transformational

515
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,039
shift for a lot of

516
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,640
a lot of asset owners in the space and

517
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:28,640
has really started to

518
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:31,360
um it's proven to to be very lagged

519
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,559
to to others um you know i guess you

520
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,360
know megan and joy

521
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,320
why is there this sudden shift i want to

522
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,840
say shouldn't what

523
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,480
sudden why do you think there is a more

524
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,918
urgency today around security

525
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,760
um what are some of the threats that

526
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,320
we're seeing um

527
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,559
that that's causing or accelerating this

528
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,799
focus on cyber security

529
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,678
i think there's there's two parts to

530
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,960
that question

531
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,840
i think uh as far as from my opinion one

532
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,400
is that

533
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,240
you just uh honestly that was very

534
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,600
eloquently put

535
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:07,679
and i think what we've done

536
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:11,039
around ics as a whole

537
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:13,280
has been reactive right so we don't have

538
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,919
individuals driving in a truck to 72

539
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,840
substations

540
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,960
anymore we've connected them to the

541
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,439
internet

542
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,760
right we didn't think about that when

543
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,559
they were originally installed or built

544
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,440
they just got plugged in which is

545
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,559
disturbing

546
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,760
uh in in some ways but also it makes

547
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,600
sense i mean

548
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,360
that's a lot of time and effort and you

549
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,120
have a lot less visibility and i mean

550
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,719
when a substation went down

551
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,080
you know a customer's going to have to

552
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,120
call and say i have an outage and

553
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,439
they're going to have to send a truck

554
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,120
out

555
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,400
we don't have that anymore because we've

556
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,559
connected it there's a lot of really

557
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,960
good things that have come out of that

558
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,840
but i think the other side of of the

559
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,120
coin

560
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,959
is uh more just around cyber as a whole

561
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,639
it doesn't matter what industry you work

562
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,080
in it doesn't uh

563
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,919
everything's connected i mean we carry

564
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,039
computers around in our pocket

565
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,360
what's the easiest way for nefarious uh

566
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,559
we'll say nefarious actors to make money

567
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,879
or make impact or

568
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,799
influence it's through cyber campaigns

569
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,880
and we've crossed we definitely crossed

570
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,039
the threshold

571
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,480
worldwide around what you can effect

572
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,240
from a cyber

573
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,840
a cyber attack and if you can have a

574
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,360
physical effect and this is we're

575
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,240
getting into nation state talk at this

576
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,678
point but if you can

577
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,840
affect something physical

578
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,120
and take you know even just to cause

579
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,959
short outages or

580
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:33,760
to uh even just a looming threat

581
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,720
of a grid going down even if it is

582
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,160
localized

583
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,640
that's that's scary stuff gets in

584
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,559
people's heads and i think it's been

585
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,760
out in the media so long at this point

586
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,200
that uh

587
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,919
i think it's almost attracted attention

588
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,919
of threat actors

589
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,000
and i'll and thank you jory and i'll

590
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,678
just note that uh

591
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,200
our third panelist matt you was able to

592
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,400
join us so we apologize uh some

593
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,520
technical difficulties there

594
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,520
uh welcome maggie

595
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,120
uh well well maggie gets connected uh

596
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,120
megan

597
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,879
uh any thoughts on what you're seeing as

598
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,678
well around activity

599
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,919
um and threats and why this urgency in

600
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,400
the last few years

601
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,960
uh sure i mean that's a it's such a

602
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,880
broad

603
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,559
it's such a broad question so it's kind

604
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,200
of one of these things you know where do

605
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,678
you start

606
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,400
i mean if we were to answer the question

607
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,559
from

608
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,640
today's moment in time we would

609
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,080
definitely have to take note of the

610
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,440
media attention

611
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:35,280
around advanced persistent threats and

612
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,280
the potential for what was viewed kind

613
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,399
of during the 1990s

614
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,080
as viruses and maybe things

615
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,600
impacting traditional enterprise

616
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,158
networks that was scary

617
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,840
i mean it was definitely the thread of

618
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,440
enterprise computer networks and

619
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,360
financial systems going down

620
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,679
and that's where people kind of oriented

621
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,879
their minds to to be the problem

622
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:59,200
but then uh you had 911 happen

623
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,039
and you had a lot of focus on emergency

624
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,880
preparedness and homeland security and

625
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,360
kind of traditional

626
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,799
guns guards and gates and today you see

627
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,600
the convergence of both

628
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:11,120
cyber and this kinetic the potential for

629
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,799
kinetic disruption

630
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,039
and it's very it's it um

631
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,639
it disrupts and it challenges our

632
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,640
traditional especially

633
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,159
if you take an american-centric view if

634
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,760
our it challenges

635
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:28,400
our security theory and the fact that

636
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,080
we've always uh in america thought if

637
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,919
the enemy can't get to us right

638
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,000
if they can't send bombs over here then

639
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,200
they can't they can't disrupt our day of

640
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,480
life too much

641
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:41,520
and the concept of someone in china

642
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,559
or russia or um

643
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:47,200
wherever in the world really being able

644
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,879
uh to attack us and conversely us being

645
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,679
able to attack them because that happens

646
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,200
too

647
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:56,720
um it is it's a different uh mindset

648
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,880
orientation and i think that until you

649
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,159
saw something like stuxnet happen or

650
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,799
black energy

651
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,480
uh with the uh attacks on the ukrainian

652
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:07,440
grid or trisis

653
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,440
um it was like uh to the way that human

654
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,720
beings view security is that

655
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:15,440
until something happens we pretty much

656
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,840
view the risk of it as zero when we know

657
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,120
that

658
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:21,520
risk exists on a scale of zero to one

659
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,799
and at any one given point of time the

660
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,120
risk is probably not

661
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,879
zero and until it happens it's not one

662
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,120
yet but we're not very good at

663
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,799
calibrating the percent of likelihood or

664
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,158
imagination that it would take for these

665
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,879
events to occur

666
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,840
and now that they have it has awakened a

667
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,960
part of our

668
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:41,360
um our fear that um

669
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,080
that perhaps didn't exist before that

670
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,399
and also

671
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,360
the ambiguity around cyber in and of

672
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,679
itself the term

673
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,678
cyber was invented in the late 70s it

674
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,760
came out of a science fiction novel

675
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,960
and the term itself cyber means

676
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,640
absolutely nothing

677
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,400
i think that most people have heard this

678
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,960
but the term itself

679
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:02,960
just means something that is uh as uh

680
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,880
it has as much ambiguity as it is

681
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,039
evocative right it's just a

682
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,240
kind of a catchy term and the nature of

683
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:11,440
this problem i think

684
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:14,080
uh ties back to uh to kind of this

685
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,440
this issue entirely you know i think

686
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,199
just to build on that a little bit you

687
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,159
know you talked about you know

688
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,960
pete the the rationalization of risk and

689
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,520
i think that

690
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,880
that awareness to your point was really

691
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,639
initiated back

692
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,240
in some of those earlier events and even

693
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,080
more recently you know not just like a

694
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,000
broken record ransomware is such a big

695
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,199
such a big deal and we're seeing

696
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,960
ransomware

697
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,120
impact a number of what we'll call

698
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,200
traditional ics or ot

699
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,320
environments you know disrupting

700
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,200
production

701
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,039
um stopping critical services you know

702
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,840
jory talked about a number of critical

703
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,360
services

704
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,879
and megan just like you as well when you

705
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,760
talked about

706
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,200
disrupting our way of life and so we're

707
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,120
certainly seeing

708
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,640
evidence of more cyber activity we're

709
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,639
seeing some of those

710
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,679
impacts that you know didn't bother us

711
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,760
in the past

712
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,880
start to hit home hit bottom line most

713
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,640
importantly

714
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,400
and people start to incorporate that

715
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,279
into their overall enterprise risk

716
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,200
frameworks

717
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,600
so i i certainly think there's you know

718
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,679
there's been a tremendous

719
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,039
mindset shift in the last you know five

720
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,960
or so years

721
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,720
and hence the number of you know

722
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,200
clarities and zombies dragos that

723
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,480
industry of booming technologies of

724
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,320
um how do people help them get started

725
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,919
set up and starting to monitor

726
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,840
what they have and then we're seeing the

727
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,279
investment we're seeing the reaction so

728
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,879
lots of good activity it's a very

729
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,039
interesting space

730
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,559
to kind of just just pivot on that term

731
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,158
apt

732
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,520
have a little fun you know what is your

733
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,520
favorite apt and why

734
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:47,360
who wants to go first i'll

735
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,000
i'll take it i guess uh so it's actually

736
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,000
interesting

737
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,480
um i don't know if

738
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,320
i would put i would actually put abts as

739
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,159
a second i find it really interesting

740
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,080
you know you mentioned ransomware that's

741
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,400
such a commodity thing

742
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,279
but we see it popping up everywhere it's

743
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,000
every system

744
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,320
uh all over the place but if i had to

745
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,080
pick

746
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,080
an apt i actually have two that rank the

747
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,439
same uh so the first

748
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,399
was uh shamoon it was really interesting

749
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,279
um

750
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,400
the way that they went about attacking

751
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,000
saudi's infrastructure

752
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,600
and it wasn't just the infrastructure i

753
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,039
mean that was what was kind of

754
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,879
interesting about it they had enough

755
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,039
knowledge around ics systems to know

756
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,279
that they could disrupt

757
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,200
but also going after government systems

758
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:34,480
as well so it was a very well

759
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,400
thought out um

760
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,480
i think apt as a whole and the second

761
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,559
one would be triton or trisis

762
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,559
and that one i honestly think we never

763
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:45,840
got to see what it would evolve into

764
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:49,039
but it showed an amazing amount of

765
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,799
knowledge of ics systems and well

766
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,440
thought i mean the trade craft behind

767
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,000
that is

768
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,960
really interesting and i think uh a

769
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,840
little frightening

770
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,840
as a whole

771
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:05,520
how about you megan uh

772
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:08,639
i'm an apt 28 girl all the way i uh

773
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:11,918
fancy bear also known as sand worm we

774
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,120
we saw that activity uh beginning 2013

775
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,799
2014

776
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,479
uh time frame with um uh the first wave

777
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,158
of black energy that was targeted

778
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,720
malware it was kind of the first wave

779
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,159
that was targeted against uh hmis from a

780
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,679
few different vendors

781
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,200
they clearly knew what they were doing

782
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,159
they went in through

783
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,720
like hvac systems and things like that

784
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,760
um

785
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,880
this was this was good work right uh

786
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,600
and then uh now they've even pivoted

787
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,679
against

788
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,039
attacks on the olympics when they were

789
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,760
held in south korea

790
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,600
and mobile apps i mean they are like the

791
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,720
swiss army knife of

792
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,039
apts they can uh they can

793
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,279
they are a very skillful group and

794
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,480
they're they're talented and i mean they

795
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,200
uh they even did

796
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,039
of course the ukrainian uh grid attacks

797
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,200
is probably their most notable work

798
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:03,919
but it seems like they're just a really

799
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,440
dynamic group i mean i'm not a fan of

800
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,279
course of advanced persistent threats

801
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,200
but i mean if you kind of look at

802
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,679
what what group is kind of doing the

803
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,840
most stuff in the most interesting way

804
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,640
again i i'd say they're the swiss army

805
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,959
knife of apts

806
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,399
that's great thank you very much um you

807
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,279
know we're we're coming up with five

808
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,000
minutes left

809
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,960
and uh i think we we really highlighted

810
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,080
on you know what

811
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,600
what is ics what is ot um you know the

812
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,360
significance of these systems

813
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,719
in our everyday lives and the services

814
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,840
they provide and so

815
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,000
i appreciate uh both of your context on

816
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,199
um you know what are your like how you

817
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,720
support that mission

818
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,960
um how you come at it from different

819
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,559
angles um one of the things that i think

820
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,279
is important for us to kind of leave

821
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:49,279
here for our audience today is

822
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,880
you know if there's interest in in

823
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:53,520
getting more into this field

824
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,760
um and and joining in on this mission to

825
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,158
protect these critical services

826
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,840
um you know what are some of the roles

827
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,240
and what are some of the ways that

828
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,120
that that other members of the security

829
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,720
community

830
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,399
can can get involved and what does it

831
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,279
look like i know i know megan you work

832
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,199
for a vendor

833
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,880
um george you worked you worked for uh

834
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,080
other types of vendors as well but what

835
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:17,840
are some of these roles and what do they

836
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,840
look like

837
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,559
i uh i think there's quite a few ways

838
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,919
that you can

839
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:28,399
you can start to to really understand

840
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:31,919
ics as a whole from a role perspective

841
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:34,158
you know from vendors there's uh

842
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,120
post and pre-sales engineering positions

843
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,720
uh which are

844
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,080
a really interesting way to see a lot of

845
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,200
different environments and that's a

846
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,639
great way to get an

847
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,799
introduction and really be able to see

848
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:46,320
things from an effective stance

849
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:48,480
another way is a lot of local

850
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,158
energy co-ops or energy companies inside

851
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,159
your state i guarantee

852
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,440
they're actually having small

853
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,760
get-togethers

854
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,720
we actually have two i live in arizona

855
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,158
we actually have two

856
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,080
cyber labs here in town that are

857
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,279
specific to ics

858
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,199
that are run by two of our different

859
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,240
generation companies and that's a great

860
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,840
way to get into things

861
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,919
and honestly a lot of the individuals

862
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,959
running those labs originated in i.t

863
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:13,520
so they can help you transition

864
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,039
i think it's the one thing i will say is

865
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,240
that it and ot are very similar there's

866
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:20,320
a lot of things that we can use

867
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:22,000
in both it's just what systems have

868
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,279
are in each environment and the amount

869
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
of impact there's a lot of things you

870
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,919
can't do

871
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,279
in an ics environment that you could an

872
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,480
i.t you're not going to walk into a

873
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,480
power generation

874
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,080
plant and do an ip scan it could

875
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,200
literally knock over a plc and there's

876
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,678
little things that you can learn along

877
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,399
the way

878
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,760
but i would definitely say um you know

879
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,279
check out your local resources

880
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,360
there's a lot of security groups out

881
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:43,679
there as far as the roles

882
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,799
there are a lot of of utilities right

883
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,120
now hiring

884
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,000
stock analysts and they're specifically

885
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,600
looking to

886
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,120
monitor these ics environments as well

887
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,719
thanks george megan what are your

888
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,360
thoughts

889
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,320
uh you know i i think i'm gonna bring

890
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,918
some hope to

891
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,760
kind of two different audiences the

892
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,000
first audience i want to speak to

893
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,799
uh is the audience that i came from and

894
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,120
that i

895
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,799
didn't start out with an i.t background

896
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,760
i came into

897
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:13,679
industrial control systems security from

898
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,720
a traditional homeland security

899
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,880
guns guards and gates as well as

900
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:22,240
emergency management background

901
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,320
and i kind of established a name and a

902
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,880
reputation for myself as being someone

903
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,879
that

904
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,000
if you needed a response plan if you

905
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,120
needed uh

906
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,520
an incident run uh i i could do that for

907
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,678
you i could i could figure out how to

908
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,799
what what people do you have what roles

909
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,799
do you need

910
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,480
uh everyone has a role and everyone

911
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,720
should be allowed to play that role

912
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,279
and i was an expert in incident command

913
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,360
system and organizing resources for

914
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,600
whatever type of response a hurricane a

915
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,639
bomb i mean it doesn't matter

916
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,639
and i was recruited into this field for

917
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,159
that purpose and they and i said hey

918
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,279
like i don't think that you've got the

919
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,080
right person i'm not

920
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:01,039
a cyber person i don't think i qualify

921
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,439
for the job

922
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:05,360
and they said yeah actually you are

923
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,440
because the skill sets that you have

924
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,678
we can't teach other people we can teach

925
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,720
you cyber we can teach you the technical

926
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:16,640
and so if you're kind of on a periphery

927
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:18,559
of uh security or law enforcement or

928
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,720
emergency management or whatever

929
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:22,559
get in through like a response position

930
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,080
just say hey i'm willing to learn i'm

931
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,279
willing to start from the bottom and you

932
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,360
may say

933
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:29,120
well gosh it could it could take me four

934
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,399
or five years before i know anything

935
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,158
about cyber

936
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,760
yeah that's absolutely true but you know

937
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,840
what those four or five years are going

938
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:39,120
to pass by in your life no matter what

939
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,879
so just do it uh the second audience

940
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,959
that i'll speak to

941
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,640
are the it folks kind of the folks doing

942
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,279
sock analyst work or

943
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,919
app sec or anything like that take those

944
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,519
skills

945
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,279
shadow someone in your company that's

946
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,799
working on the ot side i can tell you

947
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,919
right now they would appreciate the help

948
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,760
just reach out

949
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,279
try to talk to your hr and see if you

950
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,440
can get into a stretch role we

951
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:01,200
definitely need more people here

952
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,039
i think that even if we were able to

953
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,000
fill every single role that was open

954
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,600
today

955
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,279
it's something like we would still have

956
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,959
a 20 million

957
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:13,679
job deficit by 2025 in this area

958
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,000
so we there is a place for you there is
