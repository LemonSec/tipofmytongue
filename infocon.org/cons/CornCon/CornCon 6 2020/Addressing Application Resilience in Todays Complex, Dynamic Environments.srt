00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,000
around the iowa

40
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,560
and illinois part of the world so i

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,360
think about

42
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,480
4 000 miles away um yeah it's good to be

43

good to be talking to you

44
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,560
my name is mark warwood uh i'm cto and

45
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,000
ciso

46
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,520
for vrma um but actually

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,400
um most of my career i've been a

48
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:36,080
practitioner like most people here

49
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,200
so just before the armor i spent

50
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,400
16 to 17 years at goldman sachs where i

51
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,079
was a

52
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,760
chief technology officer for networking

53
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,319
and telecommunications

54
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:51,440
um part of the cloud architecture team

55
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,200
and a technology fellow um so

56
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,440
during that time i led the network

57
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,319
security function for several years

58
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,760
led network architecture was a cto and

59
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,280
actually my final

60
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,280
um in my final

61
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,959
few years i also owned an application

62
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,680
resilience function

63
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,879
um for the european region and it was

64
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,000
actually during that

65
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,879
time that i really realized that

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,519
anything that you want to automate um

67
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,040
and

68
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,040
make precise needs accurate information

69
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,720
um the need for accurate information

70
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,120
that has context

71
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,000
underpins almost anything that you want

72
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,040
to automate and

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,680
in highly dynamic cloud-based worlds

74
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,640
that's a given so i'm going to talk a

75
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,120
little bit about that

76
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,798
and i'm also going to talk about one of

77
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,840
the other lessons i learned in my time

78
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,599
at goldman

79
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,280
was about trust and reputation

80
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,840
particularly in finance

81
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,400
and also obviously in places like

82
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,959
healthcare trust

83
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,680
and reputation are incredibly important

84
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,159
and for us

85
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,360
as information security and cyber

86
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,959
practitioners

87
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,959
that means you know keeping control of

88
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,640
data protecting data protecting our

89
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,720
customers information

90
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,720
um and as we always used to say goldman

91
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,599
sachs staying off of the front cover of

92
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:11,519
the wall street journal

93
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:13,920
so john i know if you're if you're still

94
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,599
not muted did the slide move on okay i i

95
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,959
just have had some bad experience with

96
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,719
zoom lately

97
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,759
yeah i can see the uh uh

98
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,639
charts on the left and the right cool

99
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,199
okay so we're gonna before we kind of

100
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,919
get into

101
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,320
some of the some of the meat here i'm

102
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,120
going to

103
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,919
put this into a business kind of context

104
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,720
um

105
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,479
and where we are today certainly with

106
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,040
most of the customers that

107
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,320
i deal with um between the service

108
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,840
provider

109
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,000
um finance and and healthcare space

110
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,039
there's a conflict and attention going

111
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,840
on um

112
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,160
and the bottom left-hand chart kind of

113
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,359
kind of describes that

114
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,560
in every competitive business now in

115
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,440
every marketplace

116
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,280
there is a requirement to innovate and

117
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,240
get new products to market as quickly as

118
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,198
possible

119
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,840
and that's enabled by apis and by data

120
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,280
and you hear terms digital

121
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,960
transformation using clouds

122
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,198
to you know to spin up infrastructure

123
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,159
very quickly and deliver new products to

124
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,520
the market

125
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,759
um and data obviously

126
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,159
is an incredibly important part of this

127
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,320
and it's a double-edged sword because

128
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,280
data allows you to understand

129
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,479
what your customers require um can begin

130
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,638
to understand

131
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,599
you know what would be a a successful

132
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,960
new product

133
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,240
but clearly managing data

134
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,799
in our um

135
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,479
in a in a sensible fashion not just

136
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,320
protecting it but managing its life

137
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,758
cycle effectively is something that's

138
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,080
you know very very important and that

139
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,520
comes back to the trust and reputation

140
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,199
thing so i've been talking about

141
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,758
innovation over on the right-hand side

142
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,680
of that

143
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,880
of that bottom left graph but actually

144
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,479
then we have to balance that

145
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,319
up with all of the requirements to

146
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,080
retain the trust and the reputation of

147
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,720
our of our companies

148
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,240
um at the very least we need to remain

149
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,400
compliant to the you know to the

150
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,039
regulations within our industry

151
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,400
um better yet if you take a risk-based

152
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,400
approach

153
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,919
that will also that should also address

154
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,318
the regulatory requirements

155
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,758
and put you in a much um in a much

156
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,560
better posture

157
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,800
um what we're finding is that poorly

158
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,000
implemented regulatory controls

159
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:33,120
act against the business priorities they

160
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,680
they get in the way um

161
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,960
those controls can be static and manual

162
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,039
and these days they're ineffective

163
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,880
because what we see is that often

164
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,880
the application teams will work around

165
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,159
them um and

166
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,400
over the course of my career um

167
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,639
i i could i could name a number of

168
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,560
occasions where poorly thought out

169
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,240
sets of controls that have been designed

170
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,080
to meet regulatory requirements

171
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,319
have been worked around and have been

172
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,960
proven to be utterly ineffective

173
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,639
um but what i'm trying to show with this

174
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,239
graph here is you know over on the far

175
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,880
left you've kind of got the regulatory

176
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,000
compliance the old world of things

177
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,199
if you begin to take a more proactive

178
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,759
approach

179
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,440
which is around resiliency and building

180
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,120
resiliency into not just your

181
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,719
applications and your infrastructure but

182
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,360
into your controls

183
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,880
um they become an enabler and what we're

184
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,240
seeing from some of the regular

185
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,360
regulatory bodies

186
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,840
for instance the ffiec in the states

187
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,599
and the bank of england in europe is

188
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,479
that they're beginning to recognize that

189
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,759
actually

190
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:38,560
resiliency is that is the sweet spot um

191
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,520
as opposed to focusing on recovery

192
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,599
making

193
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,280
systems and applications resilient is is

194
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,319
really is really the most effective

195
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,520
approach

196
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,280
and when this is well implemented these

197
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,000
these kind of controls they provide

198
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,878
value to the application owners so they

199
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,039
don't

200
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,639
choose to work around them and they act

201
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,440
like the brakes on a sports car

202
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,720
you know with with a a resilient

203
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,120
infrastructure

204
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,560
and with good visibility you can go

205
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,160
faster

206
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,280
i did just mention now that actually

207
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,680
this kind of like this tension and this

208
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,280
move to digital transformation and move

209
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,479
to dynamic environments is now being

210
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,799
recognized

211
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,840
um is now being recognized by by the

212
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,240
regulators

213
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,758
the ffiec the bank of england they talk

214
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,360
a lot about now about resilience

215
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,879
continuous controls

216
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,800
prioritizing them controls around

217
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,240
business functions and we'll talk a

218
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,599
little bit about that

219
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,599
in a in in in a moment

220
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,440
the second half of this slide is

221
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,919
designed to show that actually what's

222
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,640
happening

223
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,760
is um the rate of change in many

224
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,040
organizations

225
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,519
driven by cloud and ci cd pipelines and

226
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:51,519
you know continuous delivery of software

227
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:54,080
um has has outpaced

228
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,720
the way in which we were doing our

229
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,360
mapping

230
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,920
and our analysis in a manual fashion so

231
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,680
things like business impact analysis

232
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,519
um and and and the cyber controls

233
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,120
are now being outpaced by the rate of

234
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,839
change so we need to do something

235
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,839
differently

236
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,000
so we've ended up with these very

237
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,319
complex environments

238
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
where not even the owners of the

239
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,839
applications and functions really

240
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,640
understand dependencies in a

241
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,160
in a in a clear and accurate fashion and

242
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,640
what we need if we're going to actually

243
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,959
protect the applications and the data is

244
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,640
a better way of understanding

245
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:41,279
you know the scope of the applications

246
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,480
throughout their entire life cycle which

247
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,480
includes an understanding of

248
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,279
relationships and the risks associated

249
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,080
with those

250
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,279
relationships we need to be able to ask

251
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,720
questions

252
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:54,320
about the posture of our systems and our

253
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,560
critical functions

254
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,760
and be updated when risks to those

255
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,518
critical business functions and

256
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,200
dependencies change

257
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:05,839
or something changes within the

258
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,839
environment to violate my policies

259
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,160
okay so this talks a little bit about

260
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,439
this slide talks a little bit about

261
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,839
what's changing

262
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,399
um and the old world versus the new

263
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,680
world

264
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:25,120
firstly as a kind of a an

265
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:28,880
information security and a cyber um

266
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,760
practice we become very very focused on

267
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,439
events

268
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:36,240
you know we have our sims um we have

269
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,440
you know systems and cloud and cloud

270
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,360
systems that generate

271
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,880
massive amounts of logs loads and loads

272
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,440
of events you know

273
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:47,920
millions or billions a day um

274
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,480
and those events don't have any context

275
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,319
it's very very difficult to action them

276
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,240
and we end up in a situation where we

277
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,040
are today where we're overwhelmed

278
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,959
with data um and that actually becomes

279
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,279
one of the problems

280
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,518
the second thing that's changing is in

281
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:07,279
the old world

282
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:10,160
we had numerous static controls

283
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,279
that didn't really understand changes

284
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,120
within the environment

285
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,480
so things like you know the static

286
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,320
firewall policy

287
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,240
that broke as soon as the application

288
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,000
changed um

289
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,720
and really what we now need is something

290
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,600
that understands

291
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,279
when the environment changes what that

292
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,800
actually means and provides it context

293
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,079
so you know for instance when a workload

294
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,319
is spun up

295
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,839
and it becomes part of an application

296
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,360
treat it as part of that application

297
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,240
immediately and understand whether or

298
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,160
not the

299
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,440
posture and the controls are are

300
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,519
appropriate

301
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,440
so the graph over on the right hand side

302
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,160
here talks a little about the different

303
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,160
sorts of

304
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,600
um systems and controls that we have in

305
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,079
place um

306
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,360
and it shows that you know things like

307
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,880
the cmdb

308
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,600
and grc tools have been very much

309
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,600
based in the old world where they're

310
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,079
they're based upon a static

311
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,360
uh view of the world um you know with

312
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,399
grc it's often

313
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,360
around periodic um reviews of the

314
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,040
environment

315
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,360
not having a real understanding of when

316
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,680
things change within the environment

317
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,120
and we believe that the answer to this

318
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,519
um lies with

319
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,880
technology that we call application

320
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,800
relationship management

321
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,079
and there's a there's a bunch of um you

322
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,800
know there's a bunch of

323
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:28,079
solutions and a bunch of um technologies

324
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,079
and products in this space

325
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,959
so let's take a little look at

326
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,480
application relationship management

327
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:40,800
and what it does using knowledge theory

328
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,000
um so if you're familiar with knowledge

329
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:47,599
theory it's often called the dikw

330
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,480
pyramid data information knowledge

331
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,839
and wisdom and it's a way of describing

332
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,639
different classes of information

333
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,760
so what this diagram shows is two things

334
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,040
at the starting point

335
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,200
first of all we have lots of data

336
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,319
so at the bottom of this graph we have

337
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,760
the machines

338
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,160
that generate logs in the billions a day

339
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,319
either from the cloud providers or from

340
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,160
our security systems

341
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,920
or from applications which are actually

342
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,279
now way better

343
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,120
you know instrumented than they were a

344
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,040
decade ago they generate an

345
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,240
awful lot of data and one of the

346
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,680
challenges there

347
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,279
is relating that data to something

348
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,319
that's actionable that allows you to

349
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:30,959
secure your environment

350
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,360
the second thing we also have is we have

351
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:36,000
at the top we have wisdom

352
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,680
we have the requirements we have our

353
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,120
control requirements

354
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:44,239
we have our regulations

355
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,199
um you know we have our regulatory

356
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,839
frameworks

357
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,959
that provide us with guidance around how

358
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,360
we should

359
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,399
secure and protect certain business

360
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,000
functions

361
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,079
and also you'll have things like your

362
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,360
internal security policies

363
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,359
which are generally written in word

364
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,880
documents which are very

365
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,279
difficult to turn into something that's

366
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,639
actionable and extremely difficult to

367
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,920
relate to the data coming from the

368
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,440
machines at the bottom

369
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,959
so what we've kind of got here there's a

370
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,920
gap

371
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:14,160
and that gap in the old world before we

372
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,680
got to automation and cloud

373
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,719
used to be filled by humans and weeks of

374
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,279
work

375
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,800
so you know the example is the firewall

376
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,399
change request

377
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:29,279
the firewall change request comes in

378
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,160
and the human being used to go away and

379
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,519
find out

380
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,199
what the systems that make up an

381
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,800
application

382
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,680
what do they do you know what do they

383
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,040
communicate with is this appropriate

384
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,880
does it conform to the corporate

385
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,360
security standards

386
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,000
and then a decision would be made and

387
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,279
the appropriate

388
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,920
controls to be put in place now

389
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,800
in the modern world of ci cd and cloud

390
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,439
that's broken

391
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,920
because the human being apart from being

392
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,600
you know

393
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:00,560
not 100 accurate is too slow

394
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,720
so this gap is a problem and application

395
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:07,040
relationship management

396
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,240
it it addresses that gap so

397
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,279
what does what does application

398
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,279
relationship management do

399
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,839
well first of all it consumes data it

400
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,880
consumes the telemetry from the

401
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,160
environment

402
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:23,199
and also consumes metadata

403
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,519
from cmdbs and inventories

404
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,199
and control planes to provide some

405
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,120
context

406
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,599
the first thing it does as we move up

407
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:35,120
from data to information

408
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:38,639
is it structures it it describes the

409
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,680
behavior and relationship of things

410
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,880
in in our in in our example it takes

411
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,439
that data

412
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,040
and it creates a graph which shows how

413
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,480
systems communicate

414
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,160
um and the nature of those

415
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,240
communications

416
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,920
um and it allows you to understand

417
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,600
information about how applications

418
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,079
clients and users

419
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,759
communicate with each other so we've

420
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,719
moved from data and from billions of

421
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,680
events

422
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,199
up to information represented in a in a

423
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,880
kind of a graph

424
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:13,839
context in a graph format the next step

425
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,680
is moving from information to knowledge

426
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,279
and knowledge is something

427
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,560
that begins to relate back to your

428
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,519
business and what you're trying to

429
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,800
achieve

430
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:25,199
your control requirements and

431
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,359
what you need to do to achieve that is

432
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,319
you need context

433
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,720
so application relationship management

434
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,600
contextualizes

435
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,800
this information with metadata what is

436
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,120
this system

437
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,160
is it part of a business function what

438
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,720
part of organize

439
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,639
of the organization is it a part of and

440
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,240
what are the cyber risks associated with

441
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,399
it so you know the telemetry fee

442
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,759
coming from your vulnerability scanners

443
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,240
and from your sim and everything like

444
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,839
that

445
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,199
that labeled information can also be

446
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:56,320
associated with those with those systems

447
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:57,680
so once you get to that kind of

448
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,440
contextualized

449
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,479
rich view of what your applications are

450
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,079
doing you then end up with something

451
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,000
you end up with a model that could be

452
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,599
addressed by the wisdom

453
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,079
or the control requirements as it's

454
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,319
normally expressed so for instance

455
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,678
the pci dss requirements for

456
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,399
segmentation

457
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,679
can easily be mapped to a contextualized

458
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,760
graph of your environment you know what

459
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:23,360
the cat1a assets are the cap1b

460
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,760
et cetera et cetera so you know

461
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:28,399
for the pci example it allows us to

462
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,960
determine the category of systems

463
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,480
label them compute the policies that are

464
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,840
required to protect them

465
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,919
apply those policies and monitor

466
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:41,039
another example would be for business

467
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,840
continuity management

468
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,600
this model allows you to identify the

469
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,120
dependencies of the critical business

470
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,959
function

471
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,479
compare their recovery time objective

472
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,240
capabilities which have been pulled from

473
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,919
a grc or from an enemy

474
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:58,320
an inventory report on the violations

475
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,880
and continue to do so forever more so

476
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,120
when something changes to say an rto

477
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,160
um capability changes or a dependency

478
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,000
changes

479
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,640
it will report immediately that that you

480
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,720
know that violation has occurred

481
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,400
i know a third example of how this can

482
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,000
work is a software vulnerability example

483
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,440
so what application relationship

484
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,360
management lets you do

485
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,840
is it lets you identify your critical

486
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,600
apps because they're labeled

487
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,439
pull the cvss status from the

488
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,080
vulnerability scanner

489
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,160
detect when critical functions have

490
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,760
dependencies or relationships

491
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,120
with significant vulnerabilities so you

492
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,879
set a threshold you know high or

493
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,959
critical

494
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,720
produce an alert that's actionable and

495
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,720
it's actionable against

496
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,000
a critical function so it's actually it

497
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,720
allows you to prioritize

498
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,039
your your response and it lets you do

499
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,679
that continuously once again

500
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:51,520
so you know what application

501
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,080
relationship management lets you do

502
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,918
is it lets you gather business context

503
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,000
and join it with the relationships of

504
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,480
the systems within your environment

505
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,160
and it's super powerful it gives you so

506
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,200
many different use cases particularly

507
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,919
from a cyber

508
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,919
on operational resilience standpoint

509
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,080
okay so i'm going to talk quickly about

510
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,720
how um

511
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,918
how regulation is changing um and in

512
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,840
particular

513
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,520
um what we've seen over the last year or

514
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,240
two from the ffiec and the bank of

515
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,799
england

516
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,559
um they're now talking about resilience

517
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,679
as opposed to recovery

518
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,840
um which is a big change in focus

519
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,120
and that is a response to the increase

520
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,120
in dynamism

521
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,439
of our it environments in our apps and

522
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,520
what we would expect to see

523
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,760
is over the course of the next few years

524
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,520
the other regulators and certainly other

525
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,760
sectors apart from the financial

526
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,960
services sector will catch up with this

527
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,480
as well

528
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:52,400
so you know point one is that resilience

529
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:55,280
and and and cyber resilience needs to be

530
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,919
continuous the old days of the two-year

531
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,120
periodic bcp test in isolation is not

532
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,000
sufficient

533
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,439
things change too fast and those you

534
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,960
know periodic tests are just not

535
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,080
realistic

536
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,600
the second point here is protecting and

537
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,960
prioritizing your critical business

538
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,240
functions

539
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,200
you cannot protect everything to the

540
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,919
same level

541
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,520
of um to to to the same depth

542
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,600
and there's now a recognition that we

543
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,120
need to prioritize the protection of the

544
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,799
most critical business functions

545
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,320
and obviously apply the appropriate

546
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,639
controls elsewhere but there is a

547
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:34,080
requirement to prioritize

548
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,679
number three the identification of

549
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,720
interdependencies

550
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,799
so time and time again what we found is

551
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,080
that businesses focus on securing their

552
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,840
you know the critical function of the

553
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,320
critical application

554
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,158
and the inter and their interdependences

555
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,918
their downstream dependencies

556
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,159
have ended up being the thing that has

557
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,080
been breached or has failed

558
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,200
so actually having a system that can

559
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,280
show your dependencies

560
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,840
is incredibly important point four

561
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,840
is is about risk identification you know

562
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,240
resilience

563
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,720
um resilience is about having the

564
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,159
capability to withstand events

565
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,000
rather than responding to them and

566
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:15,200
recovering from them manually

567
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,280
so you know we've

568
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,679
we've previously spent a lot of time on

569
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,600
detection and response and you know

570
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,360
the cyber industry has spent a lot of

571
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,520
time on threat detection and

572
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,199
and the response tools but actually what

573
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,480
we're seeing now there is once again a

574
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,360
swing back

575
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,200
to uh prevention and to putting

576
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,080
proactive controls in place

577
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,799
and in order to do that you need to have

578
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,559
a

579
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,240
mature kind of risk identification

580
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,639
process that you understand how to apply

581
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:46,720
those proactive controls

582
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:48,640
and then finally number five is you know

583
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,159
to build resilience you need to change

584
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,360
when the environment changes so when the

585
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,440
app changes

586
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,719
when your infrastructure changes when

587
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,640
the threat changes

588
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,840
your controls need to be dynamic and

589
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,880
again you know

590
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:03,760
application resilience uh application

591
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,320
um relationship management is designed

592
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,760
to

593
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,760
to address that that challenge

594
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,960
okay so now i'm going to talk quickly

595
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,480
about what we do at vr i didn't want to

596
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,280
spend too long this isn't a product

597
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,960
pitch

598
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,039
but this gives you an idea of how a

599
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,600
modern system

600
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,960
in this category would help you secure

601
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,039
your environment

602
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,880
so first of all this technology is

603
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,400
designed to protect

604
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,360
diverse environments you know the

605
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,760
multi-cloud where you have some legacy

606
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,600
you know physical mainframes where you

607
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,440
have some public cloud

608
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,280
where you have probably some containers

609
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,120
some kubernetes services

610
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,760
maybe functions as a function as a

611
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,879
service on-premise you've got sdn and

612
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,480
agents

613
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,559
so what you need is you need a system

614
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,400
that can sit across all of those

615
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,000
and plug in to each of those

616
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,240
environments and give you a single pane

617
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,799
of glass and a single pane of control

618
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,400
so what we do is we plug in to each of

619
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:59,918
these different environments

620
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:02,559
via you know edge um they

621
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,320
in in in computer science they're called

622
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,720
edge compute functions

623
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,158
basically edge processors plug into the

624
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,360
apis of each of your different

625
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,880
environments

626
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,639
um they can um

627
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,480
they will ingest the telemetry from

628
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,880
these environments

629
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,159
provide them with context you know kind

630
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,280
of get rid of some of the temporal

631
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,799
issues that you get with

632
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,600
with telemetry from from different

633
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:28,320
clouds and then normalize them

634
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,080
into a centralized relationship graph

635
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,960
which gives you a picture of your

636
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,240
complete

637
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,720
environment from end to end um so this

638
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,640
isn't

639
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,400
deploying you know new agents or new

640
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,400
infrastructure

641
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,520
we're plugging into the native controls

642
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,360
you might have

643
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,480
the endpoint agents you might have the

644
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,840
sdns you may have in your environment

645
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,760
and it allows you to deal with the

646
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,240
challenge of all of this data

647
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,600
it turns it into information and

648
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,440
knowledge

649
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,000
and then it provides you with a bunch of

650
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,360
capabilities across the top in terms of

651
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,200
visualization reporting policy

652
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,840
management

653
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,039
which allows you to to to implement the

654
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,039
security controls required

655
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,399
so a couple of use cases or three very

656
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:17,520
very common use cases

657
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,200
um you know first of all

658
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,120
operational and cyber risk management so

659
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,720
that's assessing the attack surface of

660
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,479
your of your critical applications or

661
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,480
all of your applications

662
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,200
and looking at connected risk through

663
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,200
dependency chains

664
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,880
the second one is isolation and

665
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,919
segmentation

666
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,240
providing accurate and tested policy

667
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,200
based around the dependencies of your

668
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,640
applications

669
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,240
and also the control requirements of

670
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,360
your organization

671
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,840
and assuring that they're managed and

672
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,039
effective through the life cycle and

673
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,480
then finally

674
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:55,279
secure migration effectively taking

675
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,520
cloud migration and adoption projects as

676
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,559
an

677
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,240
opportunity to put in place controls for

678
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:03,360
instance zero trust

679
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,799
controls around your applications and

680
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,039
then monitor those

681
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,799
controls and those policies across the

682
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,640
life cycle of the application

683
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:14,158
so they're three very very common use

684
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:16,400
cases our customers have

685
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,000
so i'm going to now quickly and i'm

686
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,880
conscious of the time i think i've got

687
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,159
another

688
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,240
another couple of minutes before we can

689
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,600
go to q a um

690
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,440
i'm going to talk a little bit about

691
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,799
some of our our customer use cases to

692
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,400
kind of um

693
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,400
to to illustrate this for you

694
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:38,480
cheers so the first one here is a

695
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,679
a financial services institution um in

696
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,440
in asia

697
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:46,880
uh a very digital bank highly digitized

698
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,120
they have a diverse multi-cloud

699
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,320
um in you know multiple cloud service

700
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,520
providers

701
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,799
they're heavy users of kubernetes and

702
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,279
containers

703
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:59,039
um but also they have like many

704
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,559
financial organizations they have many

705
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,080
traditional legacy applications

706
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,480
particularly on the

707
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,360
um you know on the on the on the

708
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,559
settlements

709
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,719
and on the reporting side of the

710
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,158
business um

711
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,840
and what they have is you know they have

712
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,640
infrastructure as a service platform as

713
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,000
a service

714
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,960
legacy sdns and the vr application

715
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,279
controller

716
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,600
plugs into each of these environments

717
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:25,120
into the apis within those environments

718
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:28,320
to provide a central consistent view

719
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:30,479
across the entire organization

720
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,678
so we act as an agnostic controller

721
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,279
management plan

722
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,720
for risk assessments and policy

723
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,600
management

724
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,880
and this promotes agility and it reduces

725
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,799
the complexity

726
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,000
because you know you're looking at your

727
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,918
environment and your applications

728
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,760
through a single pane of glass

729
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,120
and your people don't need to understand

730
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,520
the intricacies of the differences

731
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,399
between security groups in aws

732
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,600
nsgs and azure how network policy works

733
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,360
in kubernetes

734
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,639
there's a single policy model that sits

735
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,678
above um

736
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,520
sits above them all so that's a very

737
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,240
very powerful

738
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,000
approach to simplify and extremely

739
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,400
complex i mean extremely challenging

740
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,400
environment

741
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,879
so next this is a this is a bank in uh

742
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,240
in in my in my part of the world

743
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,240
and the requirement here really

744
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,760
initially was for application visibility

745
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,320
and assurance

746
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,600
so this organization has coarse-grained

747
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,120
segmentation

748
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,199
so they have segmentation between

749
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,600
different realms of the environment and

750
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,000
different

751
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,760
major business units but they had no

752
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,120
visibility into the effectiveness of

753
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,960
those policies and controls they

754
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,360
couldn't tell that they were working

755
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,799
and that's very common if you have sdns

756
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,559
you know you'll have the ability to

757
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:45,440
implement group based policy

758
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,879
but actually all you get back are you

759
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,600
know billions of logs

760
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,960
and nothing that really um describes to

761
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,158
you the effectiveness of the policy and

762
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,840
whether or not they're working and

763
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,960
that's important particularly regulated

764
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,799
environments where you

765
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,240
you know where you have to undergo

766
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:01,279
audits

767
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,559
so the application controller the armor

768
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:05,360
product

769
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:07,279
measures policy efficacy it reports and

770
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,959
it optimizes policies

771
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:11,039
and it manages the life cycle of

772
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,159
security policy in a very very simple

773
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:17,520
fashion

774
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:18,960
um it also provides the understanding

775
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,879
of application dependencies to

776
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,840
facilitate things like effective

777
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,600
business impact analysis and manage the

778
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,799
kind of the granular zero trust policies

779
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,039
that are required here

780
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:31,120
and again we're plugging into sdns into

781
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:35,279
firewalls and into public cloud

782
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,279
so it's a very very diverse environment

783
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,240
and then finally we're going to talk

784
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,279
about um one of the largest

785
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,399
um one of the largest service providers

786
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:47,120
in the world

787
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:49,039
based in north america um and you know

788
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,799
they're already one of the most advanced

789
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,879
software defined data center kind of

790
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:55,840
infrastructure adopters on the planet

791
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,480
um they have a high degree of security

792
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,639
and zero trust segmentation within their

793
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,000
private cloud but they have an

794
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,600
aggressive plan or they had an

795
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,399
aggressive plan which we've worked with

796
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,199
them on

797
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,000
to move to public cloud in a secure

798
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,159
manner

799
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,559
and improve their security posture as

800
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,320
part of that project so the role of the

801
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,399
application controller here

802
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,520
was to model dependencies compute

803
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,678
policies

804
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,200
test those policies stage them deploy

805
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,159
them and monitor them and ensure that

806
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,840
they're working

807
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,200
all the way through the application life

808
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,639
cycle

809
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,200
now you've heard me say the word life

810
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,840
cycle over and over again in this talk

811
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,120
um and that's one of the challenges for

812
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,320
security these days

813
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,918
applications do not stand still and what

814
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,520
application relationship management is

815
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:42,799
designed to do is it allows you

816
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,399
to keep your controls concurrent with

817
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:47,039
the the needs of your app of your of

818
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,799
your applications

819
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,240
so finally you know application

820
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,639
relationship management helps you deal

821
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,440
with

822
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,880
application and cloud complexity risk

823
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,320
and it allows you to address cyber

824
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,360
resilience and operational risk

825
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,000
requirements

826
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,840
in environments where change is constant

827
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,600
it takes the capabilities

828
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,158
of modern cloud and api driven

829
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,240
infrastructure and the data we can

830
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,679
can collect in this environment to drive

831
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,480
accurate decisions

832
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,840
about security policy and risk and then

833
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,120
continue to do so

834
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,559
throughout the life cycle so

835
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,719
i guess i'm going to conclude with a

836
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:23,600
question here

837
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,760
this technology began as a solution to

838
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:29,039
complex

839
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,879
cyber policy management challenges

840
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,919
um and also the requirement to

841
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:37,120
understand application dependencies

842
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:39,039
what we've since seen from our customers

843
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,879
they take this enriched set of knowledge

844
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,799
to solve other problems

845
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,799
um you know things like business impact

846
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,480
analysis automation

847
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,918
understanding environmental dependencies

848
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,320
you know so you know what's my

849
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,320
dependency on a concentration risk on a

850
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,240
given cloud provider

851
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,559
and to produce state flow diagrams for

852
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,559
audits and compliance requirements

853
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:00,559
what's incredibly valuable to us is

854
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:04,080
hearing from practitioners with

855
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:05,120
real world challenges that this data set

856
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,039
and approach can be

857
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,799
applied to so i'd love to have your

858
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,440
feedback and your questions so either

859
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,158
