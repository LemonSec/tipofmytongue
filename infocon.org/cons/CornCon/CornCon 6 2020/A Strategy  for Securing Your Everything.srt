and here's my promise to you my promise

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,359
is i'm going to give you some time back

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,480
i won't take an hour my promise is i'm

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,480
not going to

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,160
you know do the heavy sales pitch

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,040
because

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,319
there's it's never effective i can

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,360
promise you

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,760
uh that in my 20 or 30 years of

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,440
presenting and and talking about

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,039
technologies and architectures i've

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,480
never ever

20
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:51,520
once had anybody rush the stage or

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,559
email me with an attachment

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,480
called a purchase order so for that my

23
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,959
hope is not to come off

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,599
and try to sell you anything what i'm

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,519
hoping i can get you to do

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,799
is just i want to provoke some thoughts

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,680
i want to provoke if we need things to

28
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,479
change

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,880
we you know sometimes we need to look at

30
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,159
them

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,520
differently uh in order to really affect

32
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:22,880
the change

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:25,360
and i'm gonna hope at the conclusion

34
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,158
some of you most of you are going to say

35
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,280
hey you know

36
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,479
i want to know more about that story

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,520
i want to know more about that

38
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:38,799
proposition he was talking about

39
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:42,880
and what is it so what i'm

40
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:46,399
asking you to do in fact is

41
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,960
consider strengthening

42
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,240
your overall security architecture and

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,520
posture

44
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,119
by consolidating

45
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,119
now just give it a thought for a second

46
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,759
i mean we're pretty

47
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,759
caught up in buying the next cool new

48
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,159
flashy thing you know i

49
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,399
i sold fishing tackle and knives a long

50
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,959
long time ago and man i'm telling you

51
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,399
security buyers sometimes are are are

52
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,720
like fishermen you know

53
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,319
they see the cool new color this cool

54
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,480
new flash the

55
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,560
really great new wobbler and boy that's

56
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,799
gonna catch the fish

57
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,360
and what they end up just having is a

58
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,200
whole bunch of different lures that they

59
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,560
always end up going back to the good old

60
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,920
steady eddy that catches

61
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,599
fish we need to really

62
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:36,958
um step back and give pause

63
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,839
and consider what we're doing and ask

64
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,800
ourselves

65
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,160
with each step forward am i in fact

66
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,640
truly strengthening

67
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,160
bolstering harmonizing

68
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,160
holistically bringing together my

69
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,720
architecture or am i just further

70
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,840
fragmenting it

71
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,599
so we're going to talk about trends

72
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,120
we're going to talk about challenges i'm

73
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,079
going to tell some stories because i'm a

74
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,400
storyteller and i hope you don't mind

75
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,000
and then i'm going to again i'm gonna

76
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,159
ask you not to get all

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,480
down into the weeds but in fact i'm

78
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,280
gonna ask you to step back

79
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,399
step back and look more holistically at

80
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,440
what it is

81
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,760
we're trying to accomplish

82
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,800
and then finally maybe some

83
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:26,159
considerations for what we consider

84
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,720
the new best practice for how we can

85
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,519
actually

86
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:33,840
strengthen our environment so

87
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,879
trent what's going on okay it's story

88
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,319
time now and so i

89
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,920
i'm going to ask all of you ladies and

90
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,440
gentlemen just for a second i don't know

91
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,040
how long you've been in the biz but i've

92
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,720
been around for a while

93
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,040
and i remember when the environment that

94
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,799
we

95
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:52,560
secured in fact was unique to our own

96
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:56,319
it was ipx or banyan or tcpip

97
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,080
or apple talk ipx

98
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,958
can't forget that right i mean it was

99
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,480
all these different protocols that

100
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,959
first was the wave of connectivity

101
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,280
and so securing those was much different

102
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:13,519
much easier much simpler

103
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:16,720
but then all of a sudden one day

104
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,440
we standardized on the internet we

105
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,320
standardized on tcp

106
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,000
and it was a game changer because all of

107
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,440
us looked around and we realized

108
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,840
hey i'm not in my own lake my own pond

109
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,440
i'm actually in the same ocean with you

110
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,159
and every other

111
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,440
friend and foe and this was when the

112
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,080
bubble took off when

113
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,960
firewalls just exploded and when

114
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,960
checkpoint

115
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:46,239
became the dominant firewall

116
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,638
provider in the market and you all know

117
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,000
they

118
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,800
have the we have the patent on stateful

119
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,199
inspection we just don't enforce it we

120
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,440
but it's it's us that really kind of

121
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,680
started this whole thing right

122
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,639
now i have to remind everyone just a

123
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,880
little pause

124
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,400
we're software not hardware we have no

125
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,639
hardware dependency

126
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,320
can't stress that enough if i need to go

127
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,360
back through that discussion

128
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,639
uh i'll just bring you to ibm

129
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,600
and microsoft so it's really important

130
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,800
to appreciate the

131
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,520
the flexibility and agility a software

132
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,160
architecture does enable especially

133
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,599
as we have become so standardized all

134
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,680
right

135
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,039
so now everybody's getting firewalls i

136
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,520
mean it was crazy crazy times

137
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,280
and the fact is i would have loved to

138
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,039
have done a lot more on that box than

139
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,440
just firewall but moore's law

140
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,360
kept me from doing it so we had other

141
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,199
solutions that popped up but for the

142
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,840
most part

143
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,320
we protected the network and we managed

144
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,880
that

145
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,479
environment and then there was some

146
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,479
endpoint software that was

147
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,680
really hadn't even evolved to enterprise

148
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:58,240
level management

149
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:02,000
too well and and all of that now

150
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,880
has changed and as time has evolved

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,199
we've certainly seen the consolidation

152
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,000
but that consolidation has really taken

153
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,919
place

154
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,280
uh you know now i can do all those

155
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,479
things on a c a single next gen

156
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:19,359
gateway box but

157
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,159
we've also got a drastically different

158
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,199
environment

159
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:27,120
today because back then

160
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,960
24 7 365 that is not how security was

161
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,720
security was monday through friday eight

162
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,560
to five

163
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,759
and the the only people that really

164
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,919
really remotely

165
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,440
connecting were the guys that were

166
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,120
fixing the website because that was

167
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,360
probably where there was a problem

168
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,080
or gals i should say right i mean it was

169
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,840
a different different world

170
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,880
and over the course of the last two

171
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,000
decades

172
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,319
things have

173
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,400
drastically changed we all walk around

174
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,919
with computers

175
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,000
we call them phones but they're

176
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,240
computers the first macintosh

177
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,840
i sold the warehouser and to alaska

178
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,360
airlines back in the

179
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:10,400
in the mid 80s it had 512k of ram

180
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,120
my mine right here has 128 gigabytes i

181
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,758
mean it's just

182
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,639
kooky we need to remember the words we

183
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,880
use

184
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:23,120
matter and and so we're all connected

185
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:26,319
no wires required and oh by the way

186
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,199
every one of us want to depreciate

187
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,319
every one of us want to maximize the

188
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,479
utilization

189
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,840
of the technology and investments that

190
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,159
we've made

191
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,080
over the course of the last several

192
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,560
years

193
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,318
and so what you have is you have this

194
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,319
exponentially growing

195
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,360
attack surface because everything's

196
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,560
connected

197
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,000
and we have to look at it holistically

198
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,919
because the fact of the matter is if

199
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
somebody breaks into your phone it's not

200
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,479
because they want your contact list

201
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,280
right there's an ultimate goal that

202
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:01,039
isn't

203
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:04,159
your phone it's always swimming upstream

204
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,599
and and as we are so hyper connected we

205
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,560
need to start to look

206
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:11,039
from a unified perspective about how

207
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,240
we're protecting

208
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:17,199
our architecture overall and

209
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,759
unifying and leveraging a common thread

210
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:23,039
intelligence

211
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,520
and understand that while we're dragging

212
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,360
along

213
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,599
all of our old technology and having to

214
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,120
continue to contend with legacy as well

215
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,199
as all the new

216
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,279
the bad guys are using this cool new

217
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:37,200
stuff and bots and ai

218
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,039
and they're sometimes kicking our butts

219
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,800
and all the while we're getting told we

220
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,598
have less money

221
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,159
to do it at all the things that we need

222
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,880
to do

223
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,200
and security today ladies and gentlemen

224
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,640
is

225
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:54,160
24 7 365

226
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:58,720
on every single device including

227
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:01,760
all of the iot we need to look at it

228
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,360
that way we need to think differently

229
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,240
now if i was sitting up in that really

230
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,360
high chair you know calling wimbledon

231
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,240
it would not be uh love

232
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,519
in this long match that we have with the

233
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,720
hackers

234
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:21,040
it would definitely be at out

235
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:24,240
advantage hacker because they don't have

236
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,560
all of the old legacy technology because

237
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,040
they don't have to worry about being

238
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,839
right every single time

239
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,800
and as we've shifted to this new

240
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,360
cloud-first

241
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,240
cloud-centric hyper-connected digital

242
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,440
transformation

243
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:43,040
world that chain is so

244
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,040
long they're going after any one of

245
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,439
those links that have a potential

246
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,640
exploit or vulnerability and it's just

247
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,880
almost impossible for us to keep up

248
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,199
because they can focus on the cool

249
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,080
leading edge and we're just not

250
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,800
capable of of having that complete

251
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:04,079
flexibility that we'd like to have

252
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,959
now you know the challenges i i want you

253
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,519
to just kind of

254
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,199
stop for a sec close your eyes and think

255
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,320
about it like this

256
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:15,440
this is what we expect of you miss

257
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:19,519
mr cisso you're gonna

258
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:22,640
identify everything you're gonna develop

259
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,839
monitor respond recover

260
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,600
to everything i'd say everything because

261
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,760
it's all the risks

262
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,120
you've got all the processes defined and

263
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,519
oh by the way you're gonna start over

264
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,800
again

265
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,200
and do this over and over and over and

266
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,800
and

267
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:42,240
in this growing sprawling

268
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,519
hyper-connected architecture

269
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,519
and oh by the way you don't have enough

270
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,320
people oh by the way you don't have

271
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,880
enough

272
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:55,519
technical aptitude within your teams

273
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:59,040
but this is your life it's really

274
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,640
it's kind of almost unbelievable

275
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,319
and then when you say oh yeah and by the

276
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:06,000
way mary

277
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:10,160
by the way joe every new uh

278
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,440
cloud app function uh a serverless

279
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,000
a container you got to stay up on all of

280
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,440
that stuff

281
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,880
too there are so there's so much

282
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,519
moving technology you know i heard just

283
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,160
i i think it was yesterday on the news

284
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,440
that

285
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,480
the duration that someone is or a

286
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,000
company's in the s

287
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,360
p 500 you know it used to be like 15 16

288
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,240
whatever years now

289
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,640
it's getting down it's like 30 20 years

290
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,360
this

291
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,399
is evidence of how fast everything is

292
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,760
moving

293
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:47,040
and the bad guys are using all the cool

294
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,920
new stuff against us and we need to look

295
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,040
at this

296
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,920
differently because what we continue to

297
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,680
do

298
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,920
is like that fisherman man we're going

299
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,160
to go buy that next new shiny wobbler or

300
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,920
lure that one that guy told me he got

301
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,079
the lunker on

302
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,760
and we're just kind of squirrel

303
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,239
distracted

304
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,560
and and think about it when you're using

305
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,800
so many different interfaces

306
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,920
so many different environments you are

307
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,560
bound

308
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:18,800
you are bound to make a mistake

309
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,560
i'm a human i mean i just can't believe

310
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,120
anybody would expect everybody to get

311
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,518
old oh shoot i thought i was in the

312
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,880
i thought i was in the sim ui oh shoot i

313
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,440
thought i was in

314
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,120
i mean that is definitely a problem and

315
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,440
the data bears out that this

316
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,839
is what's going on and oh by the way

317
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,519
when i was first evangelizing for

318
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,959
checkpoint came to him through an

319
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:45,600
acquisition

320
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:49,279
in 1998 they had 400 employees

321
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,920
419 and the number of vendors on the

322
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,560
market

323
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,160
from a security perspective i think it

324
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,439
was like in the hundreds

325
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:01,000
now we're in the thousands

326
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:04,160
and and this is one of the

327
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,160
distractions because we get myopic and

328
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,079
we don't step back and we don't

329
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,600
remember to look at our entire

330
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:13,279
environment overall

331
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,040
from architectural perspective so

332
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,040
what i'm sharing what i'm talking about

333
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,319
is not you know

334
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,439
checkpoint up on its stool saying do it

335
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,880
my way

336
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:28,880
i the data bears this out okay

337
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:31,680
so we did an exhaustive uh survey

338
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,000
we didn't but we had it commissioned to

339
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,839
to talk to security experts just like

340
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:42,240
all of you global cisos with

341
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:44,480
large medium moderate size organizations

342
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,440
and and what they're contending with

343
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,560
today

344
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,800
and the data is and i want to share it

345
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,000
with you

346
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,479
first and foremost this is like uh thank

347
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,360
you captain obvious

348
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,079
91 are you know nearly everyone's saying

349
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,120
yeah they're much more sophisticated

350
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,800
the attacks are more sophisticated why

351
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,839
because the technology is getting

352
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,639
more sophisticated and we're so hyper

353
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,399
connected

354
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,480
we're able to start to put all these

355
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,880
things together they're using it against

356
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,399
us

357
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,240
bots ai i mean we've got data that shows

358
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,360
you stand up a cloud account

359
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,079
and within 15 minutes you've got 150

360
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,320
different attempts within seven days

361
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,479
nearly four million attempts to get in

362
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,199
and the accounts empty it's just got a

363
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,360
username and password it's all the bots

364
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,160
and all the automation the bad guys are

365
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,880
using

366
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,880
against us all right

367
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:50,719
if it's vendors it's very likely

368
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:54,320
multiple products okay so

369
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,360
of course everybody's using multiple

370
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,160
vendors

371
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,240
but you have to then peel that away and

372
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,800
look one layer deeper and say okay well

373
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,720
how many

374
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,639
products how many uis how many

375
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,440
interfaces how many architectures

376
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,959
how many support people how many support

377
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,079
numbers how many sales people

378
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:14,479
how many professional services teams

379
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,079
how many contracts how many accounting

380
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,079
fupas

381
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:23,199
you know these are all expenses incurred

382
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:26,399
when dealing with multiple

383
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:28,800
vendors and the fact is

384
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,480
it is a challenge not just from our side

385
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,439
of the fence i think again

386
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,600
i'm going to ask you all to not drill in

387
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,800
but kind of go up holistically and

388
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,880
think multiple vendor in your business

389
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,839
in all the aspects because there are

390
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,759
many right

391
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,279
there's support there's maintenance

392
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,720
there's accounting

393
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:51,199
there's payment terms there's all kinds

394
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,880
of you know how are they with returns

395
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:56,399
rmas

396
00:15:52,880 --> 00:16:00,000
every one of these aspects have uh

397
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:04,320
their own idiosyncrasies and results

398
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:07,680
in a very complex patchwork

399
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,000
for all of you when you continue to

400
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,800
invest

401
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,360
in more and more and more different

402
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,719
vendors and different vendor solutions

403
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,920
now this is the low point this is the wa

404
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:24,079
and this i mean i'm telling you this

405
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:28,199
is so disheartening for me i mean

406
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:29,359
being in you know cyber security since

407
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:32,639
1998

408
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:35,440
and to see that we're still

409
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:38,000
we're not even at 80 percent confidence

410
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,560
of any area

411
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,759
of our environment of our architecture

412
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,359
this is

413
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,759
this is a problem and it's not a good

414
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,759
trend

415
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,240
but there's a shining light and it's not

416
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,160
an oncoming train and we

417
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:59,920
really believe more and more sissos are

418
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:03,040
really seeing this and it's not just

419
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,119
you and all your peers but there are

420
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,879
others there are pundits that are also

421
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:10,239
saying the same thing

422
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:13,439
that if i had fewer vendors to work with

423
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,919
it would actually improve

424
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,839
my security just what i said at the very

425
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:21,520
beginning

426
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:24,480
consolidation equals strengthening

427
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,160
it has to be with the right platform now

428
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,400
i want to just briefly go back

429
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,360
you know i was telling the story about

430
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,080
how the

431
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,959
industry has evolved you know you have

432
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,439
to

433
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:40,559
pause and say how many options do i have

434
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:43,919
in the marketplace today that i could

435
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:47,120
consolidate with any meaningful value

436
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,080
with any meaningful consolidation and i

437
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,439
would suggest

438
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:54,000
there's not a ton of us there's only a

439
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,000
handful

440
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,120
and i think the fact that you know i

441
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,120
already mentioned

442
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:04,000
software only is a key

443
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,000
but now you're starting to get the idea

444
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,400
of okay well geez i got a pair down it's

445
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,720
very

446
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,200
undoubtedly it's very likely one of the

447
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,320
vendors you have

448
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,720
but you very likely haven't considered

449
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,280
this type of consolidation so when you

450
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,640
look at the number of vendors that you

451
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,960
could consolidate this is where i'm

452
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,200
going to suggest

453
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,160
they're all horses of very similar

454
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,400
colors

455
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,559
and you have to change what we're

456
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,679
looking at and measuring

457
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:39,918
uh to really see the significant benefit

458
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:41,280
of unifying your architecture with

459
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,360
something

460
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:48,160
that allows you to consolidate it across

461
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,039
a broad range of your environment

462
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,080
because

463
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:54,160
what it allows is to address

464
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,000
these risks of you know this is one of

465
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,720
the big challenges you know america

466
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,039
especially you know the long tail that

467
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,240
we

468
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:06,000
continue to want to drag along

469
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:08,400
this is a this is tough for us

470
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
but it has significant business meaning

471
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,360
and business value and until

472
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,880
that goes away we're not going to be

473
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:18,159
able to do anything about it

474
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,799
but this diametrically post opposed

475
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,679
force

476
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,160
is the speed and pace at which moore's

477
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,039
laws

478
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,400
continuing to just race and the new

479
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,440
technologies and

480
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:33,360
evolutions that are coming out you know

481
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:36,080
it's really it's it's broadening the gap

482
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,199
it's stretching all of you and your

483
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,879
teams

484
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,280
more and more uh too thin i should have

485
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,520
said

486
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,120
not more and more it's literally just

487
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,520
too thin

488
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,719
and we all have heard this data i don't

489
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,879
need to go into

490
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,640
not enough people not enough people

491
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,000
getting trained and coming into the

492
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,960
workforce

493
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,120
uh this also includes you know from a

494
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,200
monetary perspective the

495
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,959
investments because each time you have

496
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,080
to go back to the well for that next new

497
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,200
shiny lure

498
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:10,080
you know it it gets difficult

499
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,480
and then finally you know when you step

500
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,360
back

501
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,240
those budget constraints uh as i

502
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,360
mentioned

503
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,480
it's all together it's it's all of these

504
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,760
that you need to

505
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,880
consider how can i address these

506
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,840
by consolidating and that's exactly what

507
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,840
we're suggesting

508
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:35,440
that looking again instead of getting in

509
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,320
close backing up and saying is there a

510
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,440
way that i

511
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,840
can build an overall architecture that

512
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,679
unifies

513
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,840
homogenizes leverages the same

514
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,039
threat intelligence that oh by the way i

515
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,799
will put up against

516
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,158
any other threat intelligence in the

517
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,799
market

518
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,919
let me let me pause again and and just

519
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,720
remind you all

520
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,360
now that you have the three four five

521
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,960
six

522
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:03,280
however many vendors names in your head

523
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,000
as i mentioned there's only a few that

524
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,360
can do it

525
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,919
now i want you to consider what they've

526
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,439
created architecturally and this is why

527
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,559
i believe the best of

528
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:18,240
breed argument is is is kind of already

529
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:20,559
defined and here it is i've got a huge

530
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,720
bit bucket in the cloud

531
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:25,200
we call ours threat cloud but ladies and

532
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,039
gentlemen i had a huge

533
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,280
aggregation of threat intelligence in

534
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:31,520
1998

535
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,918
long before we called it the cloud long

536
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,120
before we called it threat cloud

537
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:40,720
we were aggregating threat intelligence

538
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,760
we were doing it how it is done today by

539
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,600
everyone

540
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,480
aggregate that threat intelligence into

541
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:49,280
a big bucket in the cloud

542
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,640
and every vendor claims the same you

543
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,440
know

544
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:56,000
120 billion 100 billion 80

545
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,000
listen i've done some research and i can

546
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,280
tell you the delta

547
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,159
between any of those main vendors that

548
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,080
you can even

549
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:08,640
consider to consolidate the delta

550
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,639
uh uh in the threat data the raw

551
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,280
material that's collected

552
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,880
it's maybe it's maybe 10 percent and

553
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,879
i've talked to oded

554
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,200
the leader of our research i mean this

555
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,320
isn't just pulling out of my butt

556
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,400
it's true because you know and i know

557
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,678
every vendor does the same thing

558
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:30,799
they subscribe to every feed they have

559
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:33,600
every uh source of

560
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,879
incidence of compromise known to man

561
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,039
that they're collecting

562
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,320
all of this data in and based on what

563
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,520
they call an incident

564
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,320
of compromise means it goes from 80 to

565
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,080
120 billion a day

566
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,720
so i kind of settle down and just say

567
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,039
hey let's call it 100 billion a day

568
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,559
that's what they're all doing suck it up

569
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,120
so the measurement shouldn't be

570
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,879
hey who has the best threat intelligence

571
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,280
raw material

572
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,840
it really should be measured on who can

573
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:05,200
collect all of that data

574
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:08,240
do what they do do their magic

575
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:11,280
and regurgitate the results back

576
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:14,400
to their infrastructure fastest most

577
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,960
accurate with the highest efficacy that

578
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,320
should be

579
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,120
the measurement and that's where threat

580
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,840
cloud

581
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,199
and checkpoints infinity architecture

582
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,520
will prevail

583
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,960
because it's a prevention first model

584
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,720
ladies and gentlemen i'm going to tell

585
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,720
you all even if you don't want to do

586
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:35,760
infinity if you are not using sandboxing

587
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:38,000
and sandbox technologies today

588
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,679
you are messing you're flirting with

589
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,480
disaster

590
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,760
because there's so many new technologies

591
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,720
we've been talking about

592
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,879
that the bad guys are using to build

593
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,559
exploits you've never seen before and if

594
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,679
you've never seen it before

595
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:55,200
it's virtually impossible to stop i

596
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,440
don't care who you are

597
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,760
that's why the focus has to be on how do

598
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,880
we stop that stuff that we've never seen

599
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:06,799
and because checkpoint puts prevention

600
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,159
first and always has it's a key part of

601
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,679
our architecture

602
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,760
but you know i gotta tell you i use it

603
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:17,039
every day and i forget that i have it

604
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,520
but i i know that the files are getting

605
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,600
screened that my

606
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:24,400
communications and data is first going

607
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,639
into a safe place to make sure

608
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,520
someone's not sending a bad attachment

609
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,039
or a

610
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,360
phishing link or something so it really

611
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,840
is

612
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,360
because i want to uh you know i i told

613
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,918
this story yesterday

614
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,320
so let's pretend this is before any of

615
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:43,600
us have any connectivity or any

616
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:46,158
but we have a huge 50 acre ranch

617
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,279
with a fence around it that's our

618
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:51,440
network

619
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:54,320
and we're gonna focus on detection

620
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,120
and that's okay because as soon as

621
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,000
someone

622
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,959
or something climbs the fence i get

623
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
detected

624
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,799
and i got plenty of time to let the dogs

625
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,840
out

626
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:08,480
to go and send security but i'm

627
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,120
now going to ask is there anybody here

628
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,240
that can

629
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:16,000
outrun the microprocessor

630
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:19,520
is there anybody that can respond faster

631
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,480
than your ram i mean

632
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,840
of course not and this is why you have

633
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,039
to focus on

634
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,559
prevention first otherwise it shouldn't

635
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,919
be called detection

636
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,559
it should be called cleanup it just

637
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,520
makes no

638
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,799
sense and of course you need to automate

639
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,840
of course you need

640
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,840
planning all of these components but as

641
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,799
i said to you

642
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:47,520
earlier i want you to step back

643
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,918
and look holistically at this so that we

644
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,720
can

645
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,159
ultimately arrive at reducing your total

646
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,840
cost of ownership

647
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,960
and reducing the number of interfaces

648
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,000
vendors

649
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,159
phone numbers support uh emails you have

650
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,720
to remember

651
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:08,240
and actually strengthening your posture

652
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,240
it's kind of a novel thought but

653
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,640
certainly not one

654
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,240
that we have been on but this is

655
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,960
precisely what we've

656
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,039
architected with our infinity

657
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,159
architecture

658
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:24,879
it i check the data nss

659
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:27,120
labs and the others and here's what i'm

660
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:30,480
going to stress to you again

661
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:34,239
i promise you every one of my

662
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:37,279
solutions there's bound to be

663
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,760
a cool sexy flashing wobbler on another

664
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:43,360
solution that i don't have

665
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:45,120
but i want you to pause and really say

666
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,840
is that really going to catch fish for

667
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:51,360
me is that really going to be effective

668
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:55,120
for reducing my overall costs

669
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:57,918
and homogenizing my environment or am i

670
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,520
only going to exacerbate what i'm trying

671
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,720
to heal

672
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:05,600
listen infinity architecture is broad

673
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:08,000
we're not talking you know pick one from

674
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,480
each category

675
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,760
this is an architecture and a business

676
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,440
model that says

677
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:17,760
you now can benefit from the

678
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,039
threat intelligence that we homogenize

679
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,559
leveraging more than

680
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:25,120
some 60 different engines

681
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,480
investigating in our research you get

682
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,439
the benefit of that

683
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,720
not just for your network or gateway not

684
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,279
just for your cloud

685
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,559
not just for your mobile not just for

686
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,880
the tablets and phone

687
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:39,520
everything all your network your data

688
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:44,000
centers your remote offices

689
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:46,000
your iot desktops laptops

690
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,440
cloud and oh by the way ladies and

691
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,720
gentlemen

692
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:53,919
these are expanding these are like

693
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,320
our universe they're truly expanding

694
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,520
we're

695
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:00,559
adding new technologies all the time and

696
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,000
under the infinity model what's so

697
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:05,360
wonderful about it

698
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,640
is you get the benefit of this common

699
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,039
central threat

700
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,440
prevention architecture and an

701
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:14,799
intelligence that you then

702
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,600
get to share and and evenly spread

703
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,799
across

704
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,240
that entire architecture unifying your

705
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:23,600
threat posture

706
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:27,279
leveraging the tools to really give you

707
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:30,158
complete visibility all again

708
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:32,080
i'm going to say it again best research

709
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:35,279
on the planet

710
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:38,399
best threat intelligence on the planet

711
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:40,000
uh and i i i challenge anyone and what

712
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:43,360
we can demonstrably

713
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,399
show you is lower cost of ownership save

714
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:49,760
money now some of you are going

715
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:52,959
dude i i i can't do this because

716
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,039
you are swiss cheese there's still holes

717
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,840
in your architecture you can't solve at

718
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,520
all

719
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,520
ladies and gentlemen you are spot on and

720
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:03,600
you are correct i cannot

721
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,760
but i'll guarantee you what i can do

722
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,879
is i can deliver the highest level of

723
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:12,240
efficacy in the areas that i do protect

724
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,640
and i'll save you money i'll reduce your

725
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,000
friction with vendors i'll give you one

726
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,320
big throat to choke

727
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,520
and i'll give you money back so you can

728
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,879
invest it

729
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:27,039
in those cool new shiny tools that we

730
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:30,159
don't do

731
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:33,279
all right i told you it's not

732
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:36,159
us it's not just your peers

733
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,520
gartner's been saying this now for going

734
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,960
on a year

735
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:42,799
it's going to happen so again

736
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,760
ladies and gentlemen i want to ask all

737
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:48,960
of you to just give pause

738
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:52,399
remember things look differently when we

739
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:55,039
look at them differently and will end up

740
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,320
resulting in different solutions and we

741
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:59,720
can strengthen

742
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:02,879
your position by giving you a

743
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:06,960
consolidated architecture

744
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:09,840
one that we provide under an ela

745
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,360
and the key message to this slide is

746
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,559
flexible flexible

747
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:17,678
flexible agile

748
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,559
i mean think amoeba in a petri dish goes

749
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,760
any way you

750
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:24,720
tilt that's infinity

751
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,080
with the services and the products and

752
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,559
the support

753
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,279
that you need virtually every infinity

754
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:33,200
deal is a custom deal because we base it

755
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:36,240
based on you

756
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,640
but that flexibility has profound

757
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,240
and significant benefits because you

758
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:44,080
have such agility

759
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:47,120
i mean let me give you an example

760
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:50,000
let's just say i mean just for

761
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,799
for grins that we've got a company

762
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,720
that's got

763
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:57,360
a thousand employees and well

764
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,840
you know 850 of them come into the

765
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:03,039
really nice office on the hill

766
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:06,480
and 150 are out in the field

767
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:09,840
and you know i don't know

768
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,919
something happens and all of a sudden

769
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,158
nobody can come into the nice building

770
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:18,720
on the hill

771
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:21,600
well if you're not an infinity customer

772
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,600
you're scrambling but if you're an

773
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,000
infinity customer it's okay

774
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,199
you call up your infinity team and

775
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,880
literally

776
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:34,159
on a dime we can shift and enable

777
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:37,200
with our infinity components

778
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:39,120
that change in your workforce we did

779
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,159
that for a company with

780
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:45,439
over a hundred thousand employees

781
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:48,080
in less than 14 days it's

782
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,240
unbelievable and it all comes down to

783
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:53,840
being flexible

784
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:58,720
to giving you choice to giving you

785
00:31:53,840 --> 00:32:02,080
agility and strengthening

786
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,080
by consolidating it's kind of an

787
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,799
oxymoron it's not what we think about

788
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:10,399
when we think consolidate we think hey

789
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:11,760
uh i i i'm i might be i might not have

790
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:15,199
that last two feet

791
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:18,000
fenced but hey it's easier

792
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,600
no it's it's just the opposite we're

793
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,159
actually going to bolster

794
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:26,879
strengthen by giving you an architecture

795
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:28,000
that's all centrally unified and the

796
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,080
other thing you know we've got the

797
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,080
great infinity portal that's bringing

798
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:35,918
all of this together

799
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:38,720
in one ui now are we there

800
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,640
completely and totally no but boy we're

801
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,600
closer i would suggest than any other

802
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,960
vendor and this

803
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,320
unified architecture is going to free

804
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,360
you

805
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,000
it's going to enable you to have more

806
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,959
time

807
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,039
more resources to deploy on the

808
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,760
important things that you want to focus

809
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,480
on

810
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,640
the so you can get the business outcomes

811
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,519
you need to get

812
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,320
and not get caught up in the whether or

813
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,200
not it works

814
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,678
with your sim or feeds the intelligence

815
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,960
over

816
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:14,640
to someone else so

817
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:16,480
hey i hope this um was time well spent

818
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,080
for you all and just if nothing else

819
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,840
what i hope is i hope i provoked a

820
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,240
little bit of thought just

821
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,199
you know to kind of consider and as i

822
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,519
said i don't

823
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,880
i don't expect anything but i sure hope

824
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,640
that there's some of you that say hey

825
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,600
you know i'd like to know more and if

826
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,600
you do

827
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,279
let us know because we'd love to we'd

828
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,480
love to talk to you here's my contact

i got a great podcast i've been doing

831
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,399
for a little over i guess just about a

832
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,760
year

833
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:46,799
called talking cloud check it out um and

834
