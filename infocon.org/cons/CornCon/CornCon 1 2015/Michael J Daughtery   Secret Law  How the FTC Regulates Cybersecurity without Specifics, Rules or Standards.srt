4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,760
knowledge and awareness I guess as to

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,730
some of the policies and things that

12
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,000
the slides fast and snappy so we

13
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:48,610
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a hundred slides but I'll</font>

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,330
go through them and and I don't you know

<font color="#E5E5E5">this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a if I could title is the way i</font>

and one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've learned there i've</font>

24
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,630
tear through my story to get to what the

25
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:18,820
bigger picture is because that's the

26
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:20,408
most important thing we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have especially</font>

27
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,869
with time in the morning we've seen such

28
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:24,400
tragedies my tragedy is a kind of a

29
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:25,840
small tried to be compared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to what</font>

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,700
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going on the world but it's</font>

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,470
more important to the shock that I found

32
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,450
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how the government operates in the</font>

33
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:34,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">final analysis how is the solving any</font>

34
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:37,060
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opinion clearly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

35
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:41,770
not it's actually enabling and creating

36
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:44,560
more and so I learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I wanted to</font>

37
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:47,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">be effective to get people to message</font>

38
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,180
letting yourself on fire saying I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

39
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:50,830
victim is pretty none effective it so to

40
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,570
be 15<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes of roadkill and I don't</font>

41
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:56,530
want to be 15 minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> of rovco so I</font>

42
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:58,779
learned through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the UCLA people the</font>

43
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:00,460
neuroscience Department about storing

44
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:03,640
and the most important<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing about story</font>

45
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:05,559
is that it really neutralizes the

46
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">Opposition in the brain so when you</font>

47
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:11,590
speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> in story versus just add Union and</font>

48
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,260
at you gives us 17 minutes of your

49
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:17,380
attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> it tends to put you in the</font>

50
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,640
shoes of the communicator<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you go</font>

51
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,170
along that journey together and as

52
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,109
Americans that's what happened so my

53
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,458
book is written like a novel and I will

54
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:28,000
get into the specifics that later

55
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:29,620
through the story of exactly how they do

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> states will leave through</font>

57
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,540
this and you'll see how<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bigger</font>

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,609
picture

59
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:38,890
Jonah has happened so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">got back from Sydney Australia by the</font>

64
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,810
way this<font color="#CCCCCC"> slides are really trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

65
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,430
tell everyone that this is a world

66
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:54,519
problem interesting thing about this

67
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:56,650
internet and is that all our barriers

68
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:59,709
are really disappearing and when I spoke

69
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:02,290
in Sydney was two days after the Ashley

70
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:04,780
Madison breach and so I just said of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

71
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,849
crowd<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know what are you gonna do</font>

72
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,099
is to the server in Toronto putting to

75
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:20,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">people here are in a corporate setting</font>

76
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:25,840
academia students in academia government

77
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:27,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay great so you'll see now what just</font>

78
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,939
even this<font color="#E5E5E5"> morning is you notice this</font>

79
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:33,849
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ties everything this is this</font>

80
00:03:30,939 --> 00:03:36,340
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this is porous and all</font>

81
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:38,409
these cyber security<font color="#CCCCCC"> shoes just impact</font>

82
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,819
all of us and it's like nothing we've

83
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:42,429
seen before and we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

84
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:43,869
benefits<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it the past</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 15 20 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

85
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,379
now what we're seeing is the river here

86
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:52,150
holy cow we forgot about security and so

87
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:55,060
we're putting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mad ketchup so in like</font>

88
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:57,340
we said earlier that the the biggest

89
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:00,159
weakness is the human in that your

90
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:03,069
weakest<font color="#CCCCCC"> link and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just saw certificate</font>

91
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,899
71 percent of all these breaches are in

92
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:06,940
small organizations and one thing I've

93
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,920
noticed about being a small<font color="#E5E5E5"> businessman</font>

94
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,090
d with 40 employees that are highly

95
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,250
intelligent confident<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we</font>

96
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:14,890
diagnose cancer is that we're very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,420
dismissed<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the privacy community the</font>

00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,950
cybersecurity academia and government

99
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,299
because Burnett think wearing a

100
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,070
multinational or I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to over the</font>

101
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:22,120
place and it's ironic because they're

102
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,890
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to echo chamber of their own</font>

103
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,340
solving us and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're disregarding the</font>

104
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:29,229
main source of where it is small it's

105
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,369
not me weaker insignificant until the

106
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,290
people that have power to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

107
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,730
understand that you're still going to

108
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:37,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">have leaks going on they're going to be</font>

109
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:38,350
spinning and spinning so and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

110
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,700
big things<font color="#CCCCCC"> the government has done that</font>

111
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,190
I've learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that they're building</font>

Wears many masks none more dangerous

113
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,660
than the masker virtue and everything

114
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,090
fell trade commission's job is to

115
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,950
protect consumers<font color="#CCCCCC"> EPA's is to keep our</font>

water clean<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eris make sure we peered</font>

117
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:54,940
at some time and isn't it wonderful on

118
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,010
that just put the bag of what's going on

119
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">and what I want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> focus on is</font>

120
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:03,310
accountability instead of marketing

121
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,660
labels on these agencies so we hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

122
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,280
share your stumps with a knowledge of

123
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,750
those who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> driving</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ship but</font>

124
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,239
that's scary<font color="#E5E5E5"> when he was here this</font>

125
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:12,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">morning we kept playing that sorry it'll</font>

126
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,150
be time for<font color="#CCCCCC"> luncheon and so obviously</font>

127
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">myself I always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> joke i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the Titanic</font>

128
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:20,770
saying iceberg iceberg everybody wants

129
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,929
me to shut up so until they get back to

130
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:26,020
just dancing and so it's important to

131
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:27,460
communicate to not go to and to

132
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,620
conspiracy because you have to give

133
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">people and I was one of them I only</font>

134
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,030
became aware when the tree fell down on

135
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,490
me

136
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:36,109
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> buried in medicine making great</font>

money doing wonderful work having the

142
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:47,360

have two more gentle when you wake

to file insurance we ran up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the building</font>

00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,089
department and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> workstation</font>

187
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,310
because it was a report that was clearly

188
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:18,149
off the managers workstation and we

189
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:20,369
found software there limewire that was

190
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:23,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">terrifying she used</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to t listen to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> music</font>

the employee had no idea she<font color="#CCCCCC"> was making</font>

192
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:27,029
any type of patient information

193
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:29,099
vulnerable she was violating policy by

194
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:31,740
listening to music and in that folder

195
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:35,759
were eight hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> and some-odd music</font>

196
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:38,910
files and this report and about 37 38

197
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:40,529
patient files but they were all redacted

198
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,300
out except for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one with nine</font>

199
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:45,509
thousand and one another with one

200
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:47,219
patient we were just amazed how this

201
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:48,959
could happen and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> something seemed</font>

202
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,600
to miss so we started asking questions

203
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,849
the first logical question is where did

204
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,100
you get and then how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

205
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:59,069
what's the IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as soon as we</font>

206
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,959
got to the IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was a little</font>

207
00:09:59,069 --> 00:10:02,769
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a shakiness in the response and</font>

208
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,258
they said well we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to I</font>

209
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:07,089
them via services agreement<font color="#CCCCCC"> he we have</font>

210
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:10,480
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get us a bit and see if it's possible</font>

211
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:13,360
this is a red flag we called our lawyers

212
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,829
and immediately wanted to make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

213
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,259
patients were fine the first thing was

214
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:19,779
let's close them any vulnerabilities

215
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:21,369
that are there if they're there and look

216
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:24,879
to see if we can find<font color="#CCCCCC"> the file anywhere</font>

217
00:10:21,369 --> 00:10:26,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's even spread anywhere we are a gas</font>

218
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:29,079
of what's going on one of who has got

219
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:30,849
this it's not outside in cyberspace we

220
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:33,609
don't find it anywhere we turn our

221
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:36,730
attention back to mr. Bobak in his email

222
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:38,949
communications he's seductively trunk

223
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:40,569
act like the nice guy and warning us

224
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:42,699
that the spread could continue the

225
00:10:40,569 --> 00:10:45,309
longer we waited to hire them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

226
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:47,049
for it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> meantime we see no</font>

227
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:48,309
evidence of its out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there we don't know</font>

228
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:50,230
who he is he won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell us anything</font>

229
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:52,660
unless we pay him<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we told him to go</font>

230
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:54,399
away and only call our lawyers which he

231
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:56,259
did in late two thousand and his lawyer

232
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,309
contacted our lawyers and said we're

233
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:58,839
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn this over the Federal</font>

234
00:10:57,309 --> 00:11:01,329
Trade Commission we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that</font>

235
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,459
interesting and said fine go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> turn</font>

237
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:07,920
later we got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a call</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the FTC</font>

238
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:16,640
it was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as creepy feeling like we're</font>

we have no right after that they put<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

271
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,390
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to figure out what the heck's</font>

272
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,150
going on because the FTC's calling me

273
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:42,699
and and they are enforcing this on the

274

FTC section 5<font color="#CCCCCC"> Act which I'll talk about</font>

a sucker and what I'm learning is I'm I

276
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:52,300
learned that my lawyers say that that

277
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:54,610
there's been any proven problem there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

they go along and I don't I have to you

contran or ultimately I'm a science guy

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,780
pieces as to why and it's not fitting no

287
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,699
matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I did so I have to figure</font>

288
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:19,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">out how this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happened and so what I tell</font>

289
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:21,440
audiences look we're taught in school

290
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,660
then we have the executive branch

291
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,190
additional branch and we have the

292
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,540
legislative branch which founding

293
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:30,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">fathers splitting two because it will be</font>

294
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:31,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">very difficult to regulate and to bring</font>

295
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:33,620
in legislature so they snap the

296
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:35,870
legislate button to just make that

297
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:39,050
mountain steeper which is also why it's

298
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:41,180
so hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to solve mistakes in but 100</font>

299
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:42,380
years ago Congress created what we

300
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,000
consider fourth branch of government

301
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:47,120
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the government agency an</font>

302
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,730
administrative process and all our

303
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,910
freedoms and separation of powers are

304
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:55,610
here so that they can oppress us and

305
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:57,800
they can't do things now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the</font>

306
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:59,510
Congress of 100 years ago didn't

307
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,569
understand what they were creating

308
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:04,910
what's morphed into so even today as I

309
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:06,560
spent so much time in Congress now even

310
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">congressmen and their staff don't</font>

311
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,250
understand this there is so little

312
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:12,500
communication between the government you

313
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:14,720
really learn from<font color="#E5E5E5"> 911 and don't think</font>

314
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,730
they fixed that since not and what

315
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,760
happens is wooden teeth this

316
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:22,310
administrative process here is where

317
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,569
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have their own policing they have</font>

318
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,949
they sell police they have their own

319
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:27,440
courts they have they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this trailer</font>

320
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:29,780
process and Congress has<font color="#E5E5E5"> said you can't</font>

321
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,810
fight to the judicial system until

322
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:35,600
you're through it and that turns into a

323
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:38,119
fist so the separation of powers happens

324
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,360
and this is why you see things<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the</font>

325
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:43,970
FCC making rules and refusing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

326
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">Congress what's in them until they pass</font>

327
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:49,940
and the tail starts wagging the dog now

328
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,620
this creates a petri dish for corruption

329
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,329
because these are not Democrats or

330
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,629
Republicans

331
00:14:52,329 --> 00:14:57,638
bureaucrats and they come typically now

332
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:58,839
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is different than a years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago they</font>

333
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:00,489
come straight out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> law school and</font>

334
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:02,860
they're regulating medicine and

335
00:15:00,489 --> 00:15:04,239
technology without knowledge so the bull

336
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,980
in the china shop they don't know what

337
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:09,429
they're smashing but they have a load of

338
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:11,739
power and bureaucrats have<font color="#E5E5E5"> scant</font>

experience world they regulate and they

340
00:15:11,739 --> 00:15:15,579
have TC lawyers with us<font color="#E5E5E5"> or more</font>

341
00:15:13,299 --> 00:15:18,879
concerned with cooperation and truth so

342
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:21,790
right off the bat<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have higher the</font>

343
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:23,920
lawyers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and spent a ton of mine the</font>

344
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:27,368
second you call the lawyers dick dick

345
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,110
dick dick and so and so let's go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

346
00:15:27,369 --> 00:15:31,989
what the FTC is I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wrap my</font>

347
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:33,850
head around them so the FTC's official

348
00:15:31,989 --> 00:15:36,129
agenda is to protect the consumer from

349
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:38,410
in fairness and deception an act or

350
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:40,689
practice is unfair and<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me tell you</font>

351
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:42,790
something this next<font color="#CCCCCC"> three points or what</font>

352
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:45,670
billions of dollars are spent because of

353
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:48,009
this causes or is likely to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cause</font>

354
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:49,599

cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> be reasonably avoided by</font>

356
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,049
consumers and is not outweighed by

357
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:55,899
countervailing benefits to consumers

358
00:15:53,049 --> 00:15:57,939
border competition now because the way

359
00:15:55,899 --> 00:15:59,829
Congress has create the agencies who

360
00:15:57,939 --> 00:16:01,988
makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> a decision</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on what is likely to</font>

361
00:15:59,829 --> 00:16:04,059
cause what is substantial what is

362
00:16:01,989 --> 00:16:07,600
reasonably avoided what is a

363
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:10,029
countervailing benefit they decide so

364
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,149
you have judge jury prosecutor deciding

365
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:15,369
and you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> this perfect setup where</font>

366
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:16,839
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only way to get through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is crawl</font>

367
00:16:15,369 --> 00:16:19,299
through millions of dollars in several

368
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:22,600
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> a typical target is corporations</font>

369
00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:25,569
so you've got law firm departments that

370
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,309
just sign a check and go and this all

371
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:29,439
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be fine until we starting the</font>

cybersecurity<font color="#E5E5E5"> and medicine now that the</font>

373
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:33,849
government has reached into those levels

374
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:34,868
you just got these people that don't

375
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:36,369
know what they're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have</font>

376
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,100
corporations that just roll leave

377
00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:39,620
because they bet

378
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,270
sign away and so the noose tightens and

379
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:44,090
we're this tipping point where their

380

court and the judge is at FTC gov and if

395
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:26,720
they lose the judge rules against the

396

which means if<font color="#CCCCCC"> the judge says staff</font>

399
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:34,040
you're wrong the commissioners can

overturn just by boat and every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font>

402
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:44,030
they go to appeal the FTC loses so there

403
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:47,600
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this gigantic bias that makes every</font>

the system's rigged right to check move

medical facility that's diagnosing

417
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:28,490
they're freaking out and so this is the

418
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:31,909
type of behavior is so incredible the

419
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:35,270
power so centralized that you have to

420
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:36,800
everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> just rolls and so then you have</font>

00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:39,080
the gas lighting because then they're

still hitting

they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have become a sort of PhD and all</font>

00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:45,649
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff now because it so happened to</font>

425
00:18:43,429 --> 00:18:47,779
me but think hit Congress they hit the

426
00:18:45,649 --> 00:18:49,760
media they hit every law school and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

say we're doing this wonderful things

428
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,908
we're saving all the stuff we've got a

429
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,820
broad power Congress has given us for

00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:58,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">our power went on the inside they want</font>

to be afraid<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was in a unique situation</font>

432
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:02,600
I'm not judging all these lawyers from

433
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:05,179
these other companies that just rolled

434
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,789
and stuff but the problem was that I was

435

what they don't tell you is that then

458
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:02,479
they're going to put out a press release

459
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:05,240
that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone think you're too</font>

00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:15,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">practice and I have a really small</font>

465
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:17,658
company that keeps the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tail of multi</font>

466
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:19,070
billion dollars labs and so they're

467
00:20:17,659 --> 00:20:22,309
going to run around putting fear

468
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:24,080
uncertainty and doubt and if and so we

469
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:26,269
were in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this unique situation that we</font>

470
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,549
were dead no matter what we want to lose

471
00:20:26,269 --> 00:20:29,149
lose if I sign the consent decree was a

472
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:30,649
bad

473
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:33,349
if I didn't so I really have nothing to

474
00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:35,718
lose<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I'm not a big I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

475
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:38,029
big principal guy but I didn't have I

476
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:40,820
had a very unique decision to make and

477
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:42,409
so I knew that sign<font color="#CCCCCC"> the consent decree</font>

478
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:45,859
would not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay because everyone's</font>

479
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:47,989
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use that against now I will</font>

480
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:49,158
tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as background from Detroit</font>

481
00:20:47,989 --> 00:20:51,619
both my parents were police officers

482
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:54,499
when they met in Detroit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so my whole</font>

483
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:57,949
life was has been judges and police

484
00:20:54,499 --> 00:21:02,089
officers and the lawyers so i think i

485
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:07,549
had an advanced jaded opinion of the

486
00:21:02,089 --> 00:21:09,019
federal investigators<font color="#E5E5E5"> my dad so this is</font>

487
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:10,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">nothing more than shakedown this is</font>

488
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:12,259
nothing more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than just go along to get</font>

489
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,190
along it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be terrible that's</font>

490
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:15,080
what your own what you're going to say

491
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:18,830
forget justice for good due process come

492
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:21,228
on grow up but this is all secret law

493
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:24,559
because what they were telling us what I

494
00:21:21,229 --> 00:21:27,559
was aghast at is they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have</font>

495
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:31,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">roles or standards or regulations</font>

496
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:36,049
section 5 can be that broad they in

497
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:39,109
medicine this is unbelievable<font color="#CCCCCC"> because in</font>

498
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:41,509
medicine we work collaboratively we're

499
00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:44,210
regulated like crazy we were inspected

500
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:46,820
top to bottom every man you everything

501
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:50,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm every machine every every test is</font>

502
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:53,779
documented back into hard drives and

503
00:21:50,629 --> 00:21:56,689
applications and we are we're just

504
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:58,099
amazed that that they're acting so

505
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,200
punitive Lee Nick as they go along

506
00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:02,418
because they're big excuse in the

507
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,039
government is that well cybersecurity is

508
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:06,150
happening so fast if you write a

509
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:07,290
standard rule

510
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,850
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> never be able to get the bad guys</font>

511
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:10,889
and you guys want<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to get the bad guys</font>

512
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:12,689
don't you and for my experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

513
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:15,180
medicine that's a big crunk because

514
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:17,100
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing more that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> changes faster</font>

515
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:19,170
than medicine and we do not regulate

516
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:22,620
peanut early but I decision to do if I

517
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:24,480
should fight or flight so the common

518
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:27,060
burden is what I talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier</font>

519
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,550
these regulators aiming in the wrong

520
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:32,220
direction and their collaborative<font color="#CCCCCC"> vs.</font>

521
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:34,230
punitive regulatory practices and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

522
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:38,040
fact they just wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on get</font>

523
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:39,960
longer and if you don't they're going to

524
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,750
bury you in procedures in<font color="#E5E5E5"> day time and</font>

525
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:45,690
they're nuns with guns<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're doing</font>

526
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:48,180
the Lord's work and if floor doesn't

527
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:50,220
work that good other<font color="#CCCCCC"> means but they try</font>

528
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,390
to keep friendly and the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing you</font>

529
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,700
go get through<font color="#E5E5E5"> your lawyers which</font>

why why not get I've had this is the

533
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,490
most absurd thing i've seen my other

534
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:01,140
what I'm going to do that they're

535
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:03,900
already planning on doing because when

536
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:05,370
they go knock on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your door folks they</font>

00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:08,429
show up<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless they've done a ton of</font>

539
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:09,930
homework already then the beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

540
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:13,860
the process with the government is not

541
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:15,720
high but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got you that's int so I</font>

542
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,820
start doing my own home because this

that matters is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had an employee but</font>

580
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:44,789
why we're in a workstation for

581
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,080
authorization and even if nothing got

582
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:49,770
out they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can say what they want because</font>

583
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,990
they can make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up as I go along so I</font>

584
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:54,539
can't get an answer what we do wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

585
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:56,820
what we do right from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> government</font>

586
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:59,610
that's coming at me side swiping the

587
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:01,710
company by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way and so I called then</font>

588
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:03,750
right at<font color="#E5E5E5"> sands he's the only I could</font>

589
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,980
find it that actually criticized the

590
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,850
Federal Trade Commission of them in the

591
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,610
way they're dealing with cybersecurity

592
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:10,770
regulation and I paid they have him come

593
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:13,168
in he's a technology lawyer<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of Texas</font>

594
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:14,760
he went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Georgetown Law he lives to</font>

595
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:18,539
everything basically saying you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

596
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:20,730
your effective of a crime and there's no

597
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:22,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">breach here and the reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's no</font>

598
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:24,720
breach here is because it never got out

599
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:26,189
it got<font color="#CCCCCC"> out to a government agency it's</font>

600
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,020
fully under control<font color="#E5E5E5"> the legal to the</font>

601
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:29,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">definition of reach is that it's out of</font>

602
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:32,370
control this now<font color="#CCCCCC"> in control</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no</font>

603
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,500
bridge and sure enough we start looking

604
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:36,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the FTC's communications and then</font>

605
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,580
first nor the press release<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred</font>

606
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:40,330
companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> all those bridges said that</font>

607
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:45,399
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> breach just disappear</font>

608
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:48,220
but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is the public knows enough</font>

609
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:50,439
just be dangerous and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> even when you</font>

610
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:54,760
don't say breach that's the layman's

611
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:56,919
term and we're small business and I said

612
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,149
it earlier 71 percent of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

613
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:00,159
are coming from small business doesn't

614
00:25:58,149 --> 00:26:01,600
we're totally being ignored and the

615
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,399
issue isn't that we're small dishes okay

616
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,000
by yourself probably not include where

617
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:08,830
tech and then the FTC loves to let you

618
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,570
know for the discussions that there's

619
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:12,220
these little flash bulb moments that

620
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:14,769
they say things like they're having a

621
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:17,350
good time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they say you know we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

622
00:26:14,769 --> 00:26:19,360
reopen our investigation<font color="#CCCCCC"> anytime we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

623
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:22,120
always come back to it and you have the

624
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,158
sense of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gillian watch forever and I'm</font>

625
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:28,268
just I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> afraid of these people</font>

626
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:29,590
which really pissed them off but I knew

627
00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:31,450
if I was going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take them on that they</font>

628
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:34,149
have the long slog of<font color="#E5E5E5"> justice mountain</font>

629
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:36,490
and the long slog of<font color="#E5E5E5"> justice mountain is</font>

use the courts words because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I figure if</font>

641
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:09,399
I say it's doubted but the judge says

642
00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:10,539
it's true and we they said they were

643
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:12,279
going to be wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> sign a consent</font>

644
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:13,510
decree which was a humorous story in

645
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:15,490
itself because I'm telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> these people</font>

646
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:17,860
never heard the word no and they were so

647
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:18,559
enamored that this feisty little boy

648
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:20,299
from

649
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,860
lands a small company would have the

650
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:25,220
nerve to take a son I mean they were

651
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:26,629
they were hammered by it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

652
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,889
said we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sue tomorrow or in</font>

653
00:27:26,629 --> 00:27:29,539
this way they<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen they didn't do it</font>

654
00:27:27,889 --> 00:27:31,248
next thing you know we're in court

655
00:27:29,539 --> 00:27:33,049
because they're they're filing

656
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:34,999

00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:41,509
right to come in and the judge starts

660
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:43,249
saying right off the bat no one's

661

litigated your authority<font color="#E5E5E5"> this air do so</font>

662
00:27:43,249 --> 00:27:45,740
but you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done a lot of it that's</font>

663
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:48,409
because all these movies<font color="#CCCCCC"> are rolling</font>

664
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:51,230
over and the noose is<font color="#E5E5E5"> tightening around</font>

665
00:27:48,409 --> 00:27:54,049
everyone's neck because<font color="#CCCCCC"> an ox playing my</font>

666
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:57,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">later so and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> FTC thinks that their</font>

667
00:27:54,049 --> 00:28:00,049
law of notification due process is

668
00:27:57,049 --> 00:28:03,019
speaking on panels and workshops and

669
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:10,158
publishing diamonds on her website they

670
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:13,669
think that's long but the judge happy as

671
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:17,330
much as he beat them up in court he says

672
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:19,220
he can't he has to enforce us to sit

673

<font color="#E5E5E5">down and be interviewed again now keep</font>

674
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,869
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind this is after two years of being</font>

675
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,610
investigated<font color="#E5E5E5"> over and over non-coloured</font>

676
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:28,789
thousand dollars we've installed

00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:30,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">websense which didn't exist for</font>

678
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:33,529
companies under 250 they had to

679
00:28:30,649 --> 00:28:36,320
customize a package we had spent all

680
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:38,570
this money not knowing what<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do so he</font>

681
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,009
went as far up as we could because what

682
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,809
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you doing they want a what to do you</font>

683
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:45,200
just over shoot as much as you can

684
00:28:41,809 --> 00:28:47,690
overshoot and sure enough the judge

685
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,580
Huff's and puffs but says I can do any

686
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:51,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind why can't I do anything because</font>

687
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,509
Congress makes the rules and this is

688
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:55,429
Congress's rules and what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> means</font>

689
00:28:53,509 --> 00:28:59,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">folks is that that government can come</font>

690
00:28:55,429 --> 00:29:02,179
in and use in any way anyhow so I

691
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,419
decided I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you so and I</font>

692
00:29:02,179 --> 00:29:08,859
and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually kind of probe</font>

693
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:12,070
those it is and so I read about any and

694
00:29:08,859 --> 00:29:14,649
I can't take how it works of other might

695
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:17,859
have ever imagined because I message is

696
00:29:14,649 --> 00:29:20,439
that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is persecution through process</font>

697
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:22,658
and it's such a tipping point they were

698
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:25,239
paying<font color="#E5E5E5"> the price unlike maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty</font>

699
00:29:22,659 --> 00:29:31,749
years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these are such severe</font>

700
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:33,609
attacks on our liberty and our commerce

701
00:29:31,749 --> 00:29:35,470
because that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they cyber security</font>

702
00:29:33,609 --> 00:29:36,730
lasers are so<font color="#CCCCCC"> China is doing arrested</font>

703
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:38,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're sucking in our military guess</font>

704
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:40,090
and commerce and yet you have these

705
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:42,820
bureaucrats are just enough power play

706
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:44,559
so they can rule the internet so

707
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:46,658
litigation strategy they have to see

708
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:49,119
when they do persecution due process is

709
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:50,739
they can choose to<font color="#CCCCCC"> just go option one</font>

710
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:52,779
straight to federal court which is I'm

711
00:29:50,739 --> 00:29:54,639
going over the wyndham case that's been

happen they don't have to tell you it's

738
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:47,678
so bizarre even though lawyers and have

745
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:01,510
but they do when they file case and

746
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:04,600
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why they're so stinging when they</font>

all that temper tantrum is rolling as

1031
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:34,670
can intervene yet not right to intervene

1032
00:42:31,609 --> 00:42:38,299
because Congress says the Administrative

1033
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:39,380
Procedure has<font color="#E5E5E5"> over which I say is as</font>

she says no they don't and that turned

1042
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:59,420
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be nothing that's not true so now</font>

on a second

1046
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:08,720
you don't center whose evidence of harm

1047
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:12,230
that's correct yet we're still guilty

1048
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:14,299
excessiveness is true do planners

1049
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:18,710
evidence of penetration what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font>

under sentence then we we are fighting

1051
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:25,850
to at demand what standards they use to

00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:29,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">halt ascent and the court</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to rule on</font>

1053
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:32,150
the FTC rules and the FTC is allowed to

1054
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:35,600
make their rules because Congress says

1055
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:38,300
they can and the FTC's rulers are that

1056
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:42,920
respondent that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the defendant may not</font>

1057
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:46,340
discover legal standards FCC is used and

1058
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:47,900
I quote this because who's going to

1059
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:49,670
believe me when I say that I have to

1060

1068
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:07,700

00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:14,870
with a note from Congress but I versa is

1071

under congressional investigation now

1072
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:19,400
this is when I start really learning how

Republican Democrat but and I voted for

1082
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:49,040
both parties but the facts are that we

1083
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:51,319
had read coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> into Congress with hard</font>

of the animosity between the Republicans

perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> Democrats would not need him</font>

would<font color="#CCCCCC"> not look at the hard drives as a</font>

1088
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,880
matter of fact no they would not look at

00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:25,910
these second third tier young kids that

because anything that harms the carpets

00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:41,450
all wonderful and great brand is got to

1104
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:43,369
be covered up which is why my next book

1105
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:45,470
is called the politics of crime this

1106
00:45:43,369 --> 00:45:47,480
shocked the heck out<font color="#E5E5E5"> me it's a shocking</font>

1107
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:49,160
I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe it that they would do</font>

1108
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,660
this and they threw out the reading

1109
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,490
order to the press releases and they

1110
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:54,859
work on they don't look so you won't

1111
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:56,839
find now what they didn't know was that

1112
00:45:54,859 --> 00:45:59,029
that they didn't know the judge had

1113
00:45:56,839 --> 00:46:01,040
stayed the case until Congress could get

1114
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:04,130
a shot to do this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all we wanted to</font>

1115
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,569
do was get ribbed criminal immunity and

1116
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:06,980
we needed criminal meeting from

1117
00:46:05,569 --> 00:46:10,490
oversight with two-thirds of the vote

1118
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:13,310
that's for Democrats we couldn't even

1119
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:14,930
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a vote to come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on but what we didn't</font>

1120
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:17,359
know was that the Justice Department was

1121
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:20,240
waiting and if Congress failed by

1122
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:21,828
October the just runs<font color="#CCCCCC"> most of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it this is</font>

1123
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:25,368
the difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between how they usually</font>

00:46:21,829 --> 00:46:28,430
contain everything in the IRS<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joseph we</font>

1125
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:31,430
had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> backdoor they'd know about and so</font>

1126
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:33,859
anti versa is being hauled into Congress

1127
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:36,640
by the Oversight Committee and he's like

1128
00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:39,759
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know what's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on and yet</font>

1129
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:41,890
when he goes at<font color="#CCCCCC"> FTC's like oh no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh Rick</font>

1130
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:44,170
Wallace he's a terrible guy drinks like

1131
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:47,500
crazy he's been arrested<font color="#E5E5E5"> for domestic</font>

1132
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:49,119
abuse<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's terrible oh by the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd</font>

1133
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:51,430
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> for to be made up but we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font>

1134
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:54,849
three more we found three more it was

1135
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:57,640
out there and and so they say they say

1136
00:46:54,849 --> 00:46:59,680
close to crime dog because FTC's in big

1137
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,848
trouble if they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting they</font>

1138
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:04,868
have no choice<font color="#CCCCCC"> but to double down</font>

1139
00:47:00,849 --> 00:47:07,630
because they relied on a petty thief of

1140
00:47:04,869 --> 00:47:09,760
heading cyber<font color="#CCCCCC"> p to go after 86 companies</font>

1141
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:11,559
so we filed Freedom of Information Act

1142
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,299
information we find out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the head</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1145
00:47:14,769 --> 00:47:18,578
through their staff member so it's not

1146
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:21,549
direct about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing and how to</font>

1147
00:47:18,579 --> 00:47:23,079
screw that up that's why suddenly a

1148
00:47:21,549 --> 00:47:24,430
senator gets involved in House of

1149
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:26,980
Representatives that's kind of new and

1150
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:28,750
unusual gosh what is such a big deal

1151
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:29,890
that they go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to such efforts to close</font>

1152
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:31,960
out the stuff and they're caught

1153
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:33,670
red-handed so all they do is whistle has

1154
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:36,039
the greater because you remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier</font>

1156
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:41,680
using silence and corruption is the use

1157
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:44,170
of position of trust for dishonest gain

1158
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:47,680
and then the Justice Department comes in

1159
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:49,809
and there's Rick the county<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has an</font>

1210
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:57,740
hey tibor's had called up the open door

1211

clinic in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chicago and said you know</font>

1212
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:01,669
we've got your patients we found a

1213
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:03,230
peer-to-peer it's out there would you

00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:07,700
yayaya exactly like us and they said no

1216
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:09,140
because they don't have peered her

1217
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:11,210
somewhere anywhere soon enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1218
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:14,450
possibly happen and so what he did is

1219
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:16,250
there is a a lawyer work with the

1220
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:18,049
company filed<font color="#E5E5E5"> a class-action lawsuit</font>

1221
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:21,140
that eventually settled for substantial

1222
00:50:18,049 --> 00:50:23,779
amount of mine he be so heat the AIDS

1223
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:25,220
patients are given to a law firm and

1224
00:50:23,779 --> 00:50:26,299
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first time they found out</font>

1225
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:28,609
their permission<font color="#CCCCCC"> was that one lawyer</font>

1226
00:50:26,299 --> 00:50:30,380
calling them informing them and asking

1227
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:34,160
them to participate in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a class section 1</font>

1228
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:36,980
C so then the clinic is always terrible

1229
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:39,140
press and how low will you go I thought

1230
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:40,640
for sure that would light up the media I

1231
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:42,920
thought for sure that would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:50,119
flew up he testified right after me

1235
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:51,558
about all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff the private</font>

head you kiss the butt of those the

1243
00:51:07,849 --> 00:51:11,599
government life so they<font color="#CCCCCC"> hire tempers</font>

1244
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:14,059
them because they thought the government

1245
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:18,019
like to episode and yet there's no

1246
00:51:14,059 --> 00:51:21,019
evidence from any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff and the</font>

1247
00:51:18,019 --> 00:51:22,788
FTC now does this because that's all

1248
00:51:21,019 --> 00:51:24,828
they've got but they have a lot of

1249
00:51:22,789 --> 00:51:28,130
friends because this is a culture of

1250
00:51:24,829 --> 00:51:32,329
fear because I'm not the head of a team

1251
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:34,990
so I am the ultimate pain in their tail

1252
00:51:32,329 --> 00:51:36,310
now the screaming silence of this

1253
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:39,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're close to time up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> each other</font>

1254
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:41,140
so not everybody but what I've learned

1255
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:44,230
through this experience at cronies

1256
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:46,359
academia privacy experts media big law

1257

firms any of those in that world in it

1258
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:50,830
for the money don't want this out

1259
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:55,330
because we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been your aesthetic</font>

1264
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:09,819
one-off this is law that impacts

1265
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:14,470
everybody and this is my bigger picture

1266
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:17,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that that this is exactly that this</font>

1267
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:19,720
isn't gonna be effective I'm gonna let

technology financed by building a

bully you down you don't get the court

1275
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:37,990
that turns into common law they avoid

1276

the courts they nail you persecuting new

confidence that start to show the

1288
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:06,460
evidence of their results so my basic

1289
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:08,170
point is bureaucrats are not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1290
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:09,700
solve this problems people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are in</font>

1291
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:11,500
this room<font color="#CCCCCC"> there no songs problem like</font>

1292
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:14,080
the people that created all the software

1293
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:16,060
at RS day we had 165 cybersecurity

1294
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,440
startups on the floor 45 from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Israel</font>

1295
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:19,630
that's what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop this problem</font>

1296
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,790
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> garbage is going to punish it away</font>

1297
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:23,650
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> meantime so they can keep their</font>

1298
00:53:21,790 --> 00:53:25,000
jobs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yet we have to figure out the</font>

1299
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:28,119
meantime what we're supposed to do and

1300
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:32,080
they intentionally don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> specified</font>

1301
00:53:28,119 --> 00:53:32,690
which is inflating the market as we all

1302
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:37,460
shoot

1303
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:41,300
place so the keys not the regulators and

1304
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:43,339
so I that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key shoes in this</font>

1305
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:45,349
room but I just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone to</font>

1306
00:53:43,339 --> 00:53:48,529
understand this isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just how the FTC</font>

1307
00:53:45,349 --> 00:53:50,089
works is how the FCC works the SCC works

1308
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:55,220
and they're just split in the government

1309
00:53:50,089 --> 00:53:57,440
the FBI the NSA CIA hate this because

1310
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:59,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">they know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to work within</font>

1311
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,970
citizens to get to the bigger picture

1312
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:05,660
and yet they're more law enforcement

1313
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:07,490
training the lawyer train crowd what

1314
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:08,629
some people sarcastically say the people

1315
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:11,509
that couldn't cut it and go to the

1316
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:13,640
Justice Department just want to focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1317
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:16,970
their power and so you also see right

1318
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:20,839
now the fight between DHS FTC and FCC

1319
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:22,759
for cybersecurity authority so that's

1320
00:54:20,839 --> 00:54:24,950
enough for now I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> all time the</font>

1321
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:27,770
book is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being sold half off for the</font>

1322
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:29,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">super</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ten bucks and I look forward to</font>

1323
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:32,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking as their honest questions there</font>

1324
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:32,109
to thank you
