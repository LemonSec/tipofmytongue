81

curious come on check<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out so let's</font>

83
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,000
not talk about the case study so where

84
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:46,780
did or did this start how many of you do

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,160
any kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> pen penetration testing at</font>

86
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:53,260
all figure it for your work<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this</font>

87
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,630
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> great so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably don't know the</font>

88
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:58,300
steps that that come through so this was

89
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:00,490
actually a penetration test and we're

90
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:03,669
hired by a company to perform social

91
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:06,190
engineering against their company to see

92
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:10,719
you yeah we could if we could get to

93
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:12,610
yourself so the objective<font color="#E5E5E5"> was they</font>

94
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,530
wanted to want to see if we could obtain

95
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:17,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> credentials or sensitive</font>

96
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:18,820
information and of course providing

97
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:22,240
value through the client anytime

98
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:23,440
someone's paying you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this you</font>

99
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">really want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that you're</font>

100
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">telling them something they don't</font>

101
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:31,248
already know you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving them some</font>

102
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:37,129
insights and some value for the money

103
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:40,999
hang scope for this one the customer had

104
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:44,329
actually given us a list of who the

105
00:06:40,999 --> 00:06:48,889
people that we were to contact via phone

106
00:06:44,329 --> 00:06:50,449
and email and so in the end that might

107
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:52,519
sound like well that's a piece of cake

108
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:55,879
then right they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> told you who you</font>

109
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:58,489
can who you can contact and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

110
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:01,759
times with a pen tested it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

111
00:06:58,489 --> 00:07:05,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">Metallica black box scenario where as a</font>

112
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:07,939
tester it's on me to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually find the</font>

113
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:10,549
names<font color="#E5E5E5"> and emails and phone numbers of</font>

114
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:13,429
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to</font>

115
00:07:10,549 --> 00:07:16,698
social engineer and this time they were

116
00:07:13,429 --> 00:07:20,299
they were provided so that actually

117
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:21,949
created a problem for it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a</font>

118
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:25,159
challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me cuz i dont didn't get</font>

119
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:28,249
to pick and choose so typically if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get</font>

120
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:32,569
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide who I'm going after I can</font>

121
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:35,329
decide to target a particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> department</font>

122
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:37,459
or avoid a<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular department if I'm</font>

123
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:40,219
pretending to be a help desk I'm not

124
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:43,669
going to call the IT department so you

125
00:07:40,219 --> 00:07:46,729
know you kind of work it out in this

126
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:49,549
case the list i was given were people

127
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:51,529
who were in scattered all through the

128
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:53,839
company so they were in<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

129
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:56,479
departments different locations

130
00:07:53,839 --> 00:08:00,499
different levels so there was no

131
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:05,389
consistent group and that so for me

132
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:07,039
that's a big big challenge and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i also</font>

133
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:09,110
needed something that's credible and

134
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,659
effective because that's credible is

135
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:13,139
what makes it effective in limited time

136
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:15,300
because all pen tests we

137
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:18,960
have a certain amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to try to</font>

138
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:25,259
accomplish our objective we don't have

139
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:27,900
unlimited time to do this so great<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

140
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:30,270
have a list and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to figure out how</font>

141
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:34,169
to get my network credentials what you

142
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:35,760
know where do we start so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

143
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:39,299
walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the social engineering</font>

144
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,189
process at a very high level and this is

145
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:43,769
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that everybody does if you're</font>

146
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:48,329
a good guy social engineer or a bad guy

147
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:50,970
social engineer we all do some form of

148
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:54,899
this process so goals and requirements

149
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:56,610
goodbye good guy or bad guy we're doing

150
00:08:54,899 --> 00:09:00,990
this for a reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

151
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:06,120
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been asked to obtain or have</font>

152
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:07,890
somebody perform some action so we do

153
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,649
research we find out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what kind of</font>

154
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:13,110
information is is available what is the

155
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:17,250
the actual landscape we're working with

156
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:20,399
and then you once you've collected that

157
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,839
information you do some analysis and you

158
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,540
figure out where there are some

159
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:29,370
vulnerabilities where are some

160
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:32,430
opportunities and apparently the attack

161
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:33,899
side we think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as an opportunity if</font>

162
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:36,420
you're defending it's a vulnerability

163
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:40,709
but then you figure out what you're

164
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:44,189
going to do exactly and then you calling

165
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:47,670
email you show up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> person and in your</font>

166
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:52,899
idiot works or it doesn't and then

167
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:54,160
depending on which way either if it did

168
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:56,649
you kind of go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the drawing board</font>

169
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,149
see what you learned from failing

170
00:09:56,649 --> 00:10:02,619
because you always learn from failing

171
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:04,629
and try again or if you actually got

172
00:10:02,619 --> 00:10:06,550
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> network credentials maybe you have</font>

173
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:10,269
additional objectives to actually use

174
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:16,118
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and try to gain other information</font>

175
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:18,249
so research I already<font color="#CCCCCC"> have my goals</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

176
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:21,670
objectives so research was my next step

177
00:10:18,249 --> 00:10:25,660
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what here's my favorite research</font>

figured figured pretty well into this

case study so<font color="#E5E5E5"> meant they gathered a lot</font>

254
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:16,540
of information and that's all that it go

255
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,790
through any find a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of links and you</font>

256
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:22,810
find pictures and then you need to make

257
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:26,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">sense of it so go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through what</font>

258
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:29,529
opportunities did I see so there were a

259
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:32,529
couple things one is that both on the

260
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:34,660
other website as well as local news and

261
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:37,750
there were articles about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> they had</font>

262
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:40,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">grown through her</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> injured acquisition so</font>

263
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:44,200
they had a bunch of small companies when

264
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:48,850
they can't requiring or more of them and

265
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:51,310
so I drew the conclusion i inferred that

266
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:53,769
there was a lack of integration in their

267
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:56,649
back-end systems and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple things</font>

268
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:58,480
pointed pointed me in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> direction one</font>

269
00:14:56,649 --> 00:15:00,820
was because the client had actually

270
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,810
given me a big list of email addresses I

271
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:07,630
could see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the domains for the email</font>

272
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:10,959
addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> were from these original</font>

273
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:14,890
smaller companies so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> email was not</font>

274
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:18,250
integrated also through research I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

275
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:22,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking who's poor the vendors who</font>

276
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:25,089
provide services and multiple service

277
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:28,880
providers for the same type of service

278
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:33,770
also tells me not integrate

<font color="#CCCCCC">plus 20</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IT and just know for a</font>

280
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:40,939
fact that although it seems like a

281
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:43,610
simple or straightforward idea that when

282
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:46,280
you buy another company you just put all

283
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:48,050
your stuff together on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the back side</font>

284
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:50,810
with your enterprise systems but in

285
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:53,449
practice it's very difficult to do

286
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:56,750
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always a lot more complicated</font>

287
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:58,670
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody that gives it credit for so</font>

288
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:02,600
I know it's where we're way in my favor

289
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:09,410
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> madcap systems were not put</font>

290
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:13,220
together still because I draw those

291
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:17,329
conclusions the approach that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I picked</font>

292
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:21,230
from this again going back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my scope</font>

293
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:25,460
the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I am I was allowed to</font>

294
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:27,170
contact via phone or email word there

295
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,730
wasn't really anything consistent about

296
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:31,760
them other than that they all worked

297
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:34,460
with the same company so they had that

298
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:39,470
going for them but it was died sad there

299
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:41,600
is very little obviously in time but

300
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:45,110
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> they all do work for the same</font>

301
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,990
company all of us who have jobs we

302
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:51,250
expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean hopefully we all show up</font>

303
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:53,710
because we like what we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

304
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:56,620
the fact is that if our paycheck doesn't

305
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:59,740
show up we are very likely to stop

306
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:02,620
showing up we all care about our payroll

307
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:07,839
and that's that's one of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> universal</font>

308
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:11,109
things plus lack of integrations so one

309
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">our checks there's not good integration</font>

310
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:16,899
and probably isn't good at the

311
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:19,510
integration so I decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a pretext</font>

312
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:26,290
around payroll around unintegrated

313
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:29,410
payroll so here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a site so we actually</font>

314
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:32,950
started by creating a website and we

315
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:35,260
found just one of the several providers

316
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:37,780
and it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> common for payroll</font>

317
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:40,240
services to have sites like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

318
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:42,910
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get many of you probably use them</font>

319
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:47,080
you log in and you can enter<font color="#CCCCCC"> your time</font>

320
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:51,550
and so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a couple interesting</font>

321
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:56,169
points about this the all the the

322
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:59,680
externals of it we left<font color="#E5E5E5"> we left those</font>

323
00:17:56,170 --> 00:18:03,340
alone so even though we'd spoofed a

324
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:06,370
state instead set up a big site you see

325
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:11,409
the I thought the logo the name of the

326
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:14,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">the product the old stuff terms of</font>

327
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:16,210
useprivacy policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and links and their</font>

328
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:19,570
social<font color="#CCCCCC"> media links we left those</font>

329
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:22,100
unadulterated so if somebody clicked on

330
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:25,189
payroll<font color="#CCCCCC"> Coast logo it would just</font>

331
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:27,469
to the payroll co site and if they

332
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:29,690
clicked<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDing the social media</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> links it</font>

333
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:34,460
would take them to the real social media

334
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:42,020
papers can anybody guess why we chose<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

335
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:45,080
leave those intact I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of kind of it</font>

336
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:49,309
is to create credibility because I know

337
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:53,090
and bad guys now that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for training we</font>

338
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:55,129
were taught to and hover over some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

339
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:57,139
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and look at the link and</font>

340
00:18:55,130 --> 00:19:02,059
see if it looks legit before we click

341
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:06,110
right so by keeping all of that stuff

342
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:10,340
intact it gives that<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole page a look</font>

343
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:13,370
legitimacy it makes it seem like it's

344
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:17,059
exactly the way it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be we had an</font>

345
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:19,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">accompany the company's logo on there to</font>

346
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:24,918
again make it look like it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was it was</font>

347
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:29,809
real we asked people to put in their

348
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:33,080
corporate username and password and made

349
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:36,020
those required and then click login and

350
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,908
so on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back side we had database that</font>

351
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:41,600
would collect the username and password

352
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:43,730
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> people won't put in and they don't</font>

353
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,740
show me you heard it in the first call

354
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:49,860
and we'll listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to another call</font>

355
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:52,590
when you actually click login that you

356
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:54,990
get an error message and what is more

357
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:56,820
incredible than technology being

358
00:19:54,990 --> 00:20:03,360
disappointing and that were in the right

359
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:07,379
unfortunately so I one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things we</font>

360
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:12,840
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> was send a general fish out and it</font>

361
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:15,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">is from the benefits</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Department a term</font>

362
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,309
benefits team and we have company logo

363
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:21,750
on there it's all about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new payroll</font>

364
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:23,879
portal to explain what the project is we

365
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:26,340
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> them a link to click and it doesn't</font>

366
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:31,800
execute anything it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just takes them to</font>

367
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:34,050
our Scoob site and then because

368
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:38,070
everyone's busy right neverlin's times

369
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:39,809
worth something we would put in they had

370
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,309
team members<font color="#E5E5E5"> who provide feedback</font>

371
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:43,110
outside when we entered<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a drawing</font>

372
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:47,760
for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifty-dollar visa gift card</font>

373
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:50,699
because who doesn't like those we

374
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:53,640
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a couple people try logging</font>

375
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:55,679
in multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> times because our error</font>

376
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,540
message said I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry the site is not</font>

377
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,250
working come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> job please try to get</font>

378
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:02,520
a leader in some people like they really

379
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:05,250
wanted that gift<font color="#CCCCCC"> card I felt a little</font>

380
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,809
bad about that tell you you're probably

381
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna get more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> word</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is training I'm</font>

382
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:14,520
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to get a gift card</font>

383
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:16,070
and then here's an example of a more

384
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,170
targeted fish that

385
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:21,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">dead and so this is based in part on</font>

386
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:24,950
information I found on linkedin where

387
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:28,790
again you know we're claiming there were

388
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:33,320
adjourned benefits and so by the new

389
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:35,930
peril portal but because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had a name a</font>

390
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:39,530
list of specific names I could research

391
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:41,780
them on<font color="#E5E5E5"> LinkedIn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and a lot profiles even</font>

392
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:43,700
though<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you just look at them</font>

393
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:48,290
public itzel reveals a lot of

394
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:52,160
information and so examples were I do he

395
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:53,810
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a long time associated and also</font>

396
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:57,500
through my research I knew I should use

397
00:21:53,810 --> 00:22:00,649
the word associate that employee or team

398
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:02,840
member so those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all details that</font>

399
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:05,450
make it make things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> theme more</font>

400
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:08,179
credible so you did with the company a

401
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:10,280
long time and we also knew that this

402
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:12,860
person had been<font color="#E5E5E5"> in desktop support for a</font>

403
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:15,770
long time so that was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey because</font>

404
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:18,620
you know we know that you have worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

405
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:22,970
this department for a long time you can

406
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:25,639

409
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:39,070
at this one and then we did phone calls

410
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:40,540
as well so we'll listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one more and</font>

411
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:51,639
then we'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

they have a great weekend<font color="#CCCCCC"> fine developer</font>

444
00:24:52,440 --> 00:25:03,060
let me down again so so a couple things

445
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:05,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we heard in that the consulting</font>

446
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:07,530
company that claimed to be from that was

447
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,780
information I got from a better case

448
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:13,050
study so I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> dropping the name of a</font>

449
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:16,590
real consulting company than had worked

450
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:19,139
with the the target company here so that

451
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:20,790
was going to and some possibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

452
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:24,330
something I asked around that was a

453
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:27,090
company they they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the name</font>

454
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:29,460
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I dropped in both calls it was</font>

455
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:31,439
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the name of the head of human</font>

456
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:35,460
resources and I knew him from LinkedIn

457
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:39,930
that this person was known for

458
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:41,700
efficiency based projects and what would

459
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:45,420
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more efficient than consolidating</font>

460
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:48,240
barrel sight that's very plausible also

461
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:52,380
because I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> named dropping that head</font>

462
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,750
of HR I used that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call people who</font>

463
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:58,290
either or in the same facility or may be

464
00:25:54,750 --> 00:26:00,200
of a certain areas in other facilities I

465
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:03,620
knew that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they would</font>

466
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:06,470
recognize the name but they weren't

467
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:10,010
peers so they probably weren't going to

468
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:12,289
people who have had lunch and could ask

469
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:15,769
about the payroll portal they would<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

470
00:26:12,289 --> 00:26:20,029
be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wear and and so I could use</font>

471
00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:26,059
that inferred authority that goes with

472
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:31,490
the person's name and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I drop it and so</font>

473
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:34,158
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is sadness that and that worked</font>

474
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:36,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty well it actually took a little</font>

475
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,299
while to get that particular color to

476
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:41,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">the site which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why i said sorry this</font>

477
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:44,539
is taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> so long how did it obviously</font>

478
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:48,470
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> take too long on our solicitud</font>

479
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:51,950
here but it<font color="#CCCCCC"> will take awhile so to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recap</font>

480
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:53,750
my hand goals and that was to see if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

481
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:56,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">could use social engineering techniques</font>

482
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:59,240
to gain our credentials or sensitive

483
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:04,370
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> it didn't a bunch of</font>

484
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:07,039
research and I did a spin sometime I had

485
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:09,529
an analysis figuring out what all the

486
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:11,360
information I found what did it being

487
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:13,070
wanted me to the company<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we're</font>

488
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,740
missing like they were would be

489
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:22,039
vulnerable to a social engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> tak</font>

490
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:25,880
then you heard called we emailed and and

491
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:27,500
we did gained our credentials<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

492
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:30,650
never once

493
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:32,810
me or your ID and password they just

494
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:48,770
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the side and entered it for me</font>

495
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:51,889
so then that is that percentage of you

496
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:55,190
get potential from you get all the

497
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:56,600
homework oh how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> users what</font>

498
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:59,450
percentage i gave credentials were

499
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:02,030
definitely not all of them did pretty

500
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:04,880
well on phone calls phone calls are

501
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:07,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">Mormon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> immediate fishes sort of depend</font>

502
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:11,420
on how busy somebody is and we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

503
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:13,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">chat very now immediately</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so it's no</font>

504
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:16,730
I'm no different than when you do a fish

505
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:20,629
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'd only left them active for</font>

506
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:22,070
certain certain periods of time so it's

507
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:28,400
usually a little more limited with

508
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:31,010
fishes you get any information<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

509
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:32,570
what type of credentials you were

510
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,620
looking for so in other words<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they</font>

511
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:36,020
gave you a list of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

512
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:38,030
read-only access even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you gotta</font>

513
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:40,610
replace Perez might not be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

514
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:42,620
in real information out of it so did you

515
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:46,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">know whether those people actually had</font>

516
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:48,110
access to things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

517
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:50,420
wanted

518
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:53,299
do we know whether the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that we</font>

519
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:55,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">gained</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> credentials from would actually</font>

520
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:58,400
have access to a sensitive information

521
00:28:55,580 --> 00:29:02,149
but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> knew what departments they were</font>

522
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:06,110
from what level they were so so we did

523
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:09,110
and they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> selected because the art</font>

524
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:14,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">my stakeholder wanted to to understand</font>

525
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:17,919
how how well defended or not different

526
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,919
areas of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the company were</font>

527
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:34,720
they

528
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:42,440
well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't talk about specific</font>

529
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:44,600
outcomes but really some changes did

530
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:47,990
have been because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

531
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:50,290
information that came out of the pen

532
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,290
test

533
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:06,750
oh no the from address was just just

534
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:09,150
straight-up spoofed a I think we could

535
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:11,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">have gotten a reply if somebody hit</font>

536
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:13,679
reply think we could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotten a reply</font>

537
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:15,479
note we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to be careful about</font>

538
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,340
that because it's a little awkward when

539
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:21,270
somebody hits replying that goes to

540
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:26,850
somebody for real in the company not

541
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:29,070
good Holly did you put<font color="#CCCCCC"> might need one</font>

542
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:31,678

job<font color="#CCCCCC"> too when you got like the first</font>

person's how long did it take from one

545
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:40,830
we actually started the word to when we

546
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:43,590
got the first credentials wasn't the

547
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:47,790
only thing I was working on so it's a it

548
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:49,199
said which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of typical oftentimes</font>

549
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:50,520
in consulting we have a bunch of

550
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:58,200
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we're doing at the same</font>

551
00:30:50,520 --> 00:31:02,460
time but how clean it was elapsed time

552
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:05,400
couple weeks but x times spent we spend

553
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:09,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">with a bunch of time on the research and</font>

554
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:12,000
the analysis that is the the the real

555
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:14,790
heavy lifting the phone calls relatively

556
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,900
don't even take that long so you've got

557
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:20,100
a couple days few days worth of research

558
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:22,230
of analysis you have to come up with

559
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,740
something pretty quick which is the

560
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:25,510
challenge in pen test

561

00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,510
have the luxury of spending more any

564
00:31:30,309 --> 00:31:36,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">more time to think about it they are</font>
