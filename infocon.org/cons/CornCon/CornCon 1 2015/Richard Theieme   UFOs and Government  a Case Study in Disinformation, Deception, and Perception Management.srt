8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,809
definition of the problem is usually now

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,670
what we think is the way it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:20,429
to do stuff so the theme if there is one

26
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,310
is that things are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they seem</font>

27

00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:51,750
the lines so that's what my games is

complicated things get but with one

247
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:07,109
thing leading to another and one of the

248
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,450
ways we try to start it out was this

and mature

337
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:33,740
searchers have to have places that look

338
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:36,560
like this and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what Mike</font>

spaceman looks like except their walls

340
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,510
and walls and walls of it and we meet

341
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:44,270
there and we do research there that's

342
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:46,010
another wall that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that he</font>

and a different communication style so

353
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,329
you can all draw the communion alien you

354
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,359
can all draw a flying saucer so it's not

355
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:28,430
like we don't know about some kinds of

flying saucers or humanoid presence on

357
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:34,160
the planet is that these images have

and the three leading stories on the

<font color="#CCCCCC">Hanson a journalist in Oregon decided to</font>

00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:01,809
write the missing times it was because

00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:04,120
in the 1970s someone called him from<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

447
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:10,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">on out here and he said what's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

448
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,189
he said there's sightings there's a vent

449
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:16,209
there if you include<font color="#CCCCCC"> an interference</font>

450
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:17,980
with codes on nuclear missiles for

451
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:19,870
several days and it's covered by<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

452
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,419
local media and Terry said why didn't it

453
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:25,870
ever migrate to the top media why was

454
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:27,400
this never covered seriously I so we

455
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:29,408
investigated that he found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the only</font>

story on moms from appeared four years

457
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:33,340
later in the National Enquirer but it

458
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,408
wouldn't go away and then of course that

459
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:37,990
killed the story this is standard

00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:43,270
not unusual John Kenneth Galbraith was

an ambassador to India he found a rag

463

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was worse than Nixon he demanded</font>

464
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:48,390
his staff find out

465
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:50,640
bastards put it out if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a CIA</font>

466
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:53,010
covert operation so there's good stuff

467
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,770
they published over<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1,000 books</font>

468

00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:03,480
undertook all sorts of dietary

471
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:06,659
operations which were covertly executed

472
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:09,330
and very effectively disguised because

473
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:11,880
they understood that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be their job and</font>

474
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:14,970
that coincided with the onrush of UFO

phenomena there was other news<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font>

00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:20,970
this is what UFO could look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

1952 if i have time will tell you why

481
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:31,530
they glow white like that what<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

ionization of the nitrogen in the

atmosphere around is taking place and

484
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,960
why the colors change in direct

the force of the gas that's fine this is

not fine there are no wings this is

with this was it Russian because the

could not do it either they did not<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

and began slowly closing in on it you

00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:39,168
can imagine how<font color="#CCCCCC"> he felt if six of us got</font>

up and closed in on our hapless example

ridicule most effective when the timing

889
00:35:40,369 --> 00:35:43,910
is just right because ridicule destroys

890
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:46,369
the credibility of the witness forgery

891
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:49,368
while not even touching the testimony in

fact you a lateen what is and that's

893
00:35:49,369 --> 00:35:54,530
what's been done so it's effectively

894
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:56,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">here lots of stories about that so</font>

00:35:56,330 --> 00:36:04,430
that wasn't a determinant determinative

00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:06,589
of how all government policy followed is

898
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:07,700
not that simple but that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way they</font>

899

were thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that was the</font>

900
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,299
recommendation and that pretty much came

901
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,609
out so we had all much longer document

902
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:15,109
appended to that it shows their attempt

they went somewhere else Hynek was hired

1007
00:40:21,759 --> 00:40:27,830
and did his best to wiggle

1008

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> relationship</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be maintained</font>

by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Air Force it was a tax for not</font>

1010
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,020
being rigorous and hard-nosed but he

1011
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:34,820
didn't they fire him because he had<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

1012
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:36,230
leverage to stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> he wanted to stay</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">because he wanted to know what's going</font>

1014
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:40,190
on his deathbed even said why won't they

1015
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:42,710
tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is going on he have cancer</font>

00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:44,690
by then<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that was one of his last</font>

1017
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:46,910
statements why won't they tell me I went

1018
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:48,710
to tell him and he<font color="#CCCCCC"> said this factually</font>

1019
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:50,600
before then the public is placed on the

1020
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:52,370
role in the enemy against whom

1021
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,589
counterespionage tactics you're employed

1022
00:40:52,370 --> 00:41:00,710
this is the point of what the national

1023

security state has become it's just it's

1024
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:05,510
just a shame because they live in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

hope you'll hear more about that later

1041
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:41,090
but NATO has a team whose job is to read

1042
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,560
and monitor Russian propaganda in order

1043

00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:25,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">they had to debrief the people who are</font>

be wrong because 1950 40s giving a

good data from good responsible

1133

witnesses and observers and it's

is consistent with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way the power and</font>

with that so what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do what you</font>

1140

want as a private citizen wrote a book
