timely so it must be delivered<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

148
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,600
time was still relevant and useful most

149
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,940
of time you go like okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> um do you know</font>

150
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:04,600
about this up service upload for

153
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,609
this stuff from the onion we did a lot

154
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:15,910
of research we plug<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our sources and</font>

155
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:20,230
this is stuff that we research we do

156
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:23,350
analyze and we provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone else so</font>

157
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:26,440
let's go on<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those steps on on the</font>

158
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:28,330
cycle the first of all is one this is

159
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,010
when you define the objectives of what

160
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,260
you might want to do what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> might one</font>

161
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:34,270
to defend what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the purpose of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

162
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,700
infrastructure what is the purpose of

163
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:39,549
the intelligence work you define

164
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:42,729
bioscience certain things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look</font>

165
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:44,380
for that you start monitoring it saw its

166
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:46,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">behavior this is also very good</font>

167
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:50,740
substance and you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font>

168
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:53,169
develop you can see variables populate

169
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:55,630
and you can monitor all those things to

170
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:59,020
your bench and the essential information

171
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:01,090
on this work what our idea is as the

172
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:04,810
stuff that you know and study you don't

173
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:07,270
know so you already know that helps you

174
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:09,460
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem or the course</font>

175

selection the something you don't know

176
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:14,530
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to focus on that so</font>

177
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,669
you can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> even more certainty and you</font>

178
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:18,340
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep going forward with your</font>

179
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:21,640
objectives now for information security

180
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:23,770
I've added up a couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> examples here</font>

181
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,210
for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> the objective might be to</font>

IES we can review current technology and

use business plans vulnerabilities that

191
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:56,230

198
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:15,649
find your sources of information where

you place those sensors that give you

200

information and what the value of those

201

things are for you when you set them out

202
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:26,029
there in the field this stuff is all

203
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:27,920
about just<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's kinda I used to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:39,109
we can pick internal sources tell that

00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,170
it's inside our boundaries we can ping

209

external information we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> also define</font>

if those horses are open or closed and

211
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,760
we can also hope to find if those

212
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:53,540
sources are technical in its nature or

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much of stuff you can</font>

define for your source now the methods

how you're going to get that information

220

special label on those things saying

this is information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I need to they</font>

230
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,690
those sensors will be very important to

00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:40,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">you when it comes to placement the</font>

that's when someone's got to be the

238
00:10:53,690 --> 00:11:00,230
final there and the cost is it very

239
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:04,069
expensive for me to get this information

240
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:05,160
is easier for me to get that defines if

241
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:07,079
we need to and

242
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:11,310
more time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> resources on getting that</font>

the main point in here how those

00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:08,540
doesn't matter if it's low key or if

it's hiking as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as it</font>

it can be used there's no set tool or

you to dig deeper into this into this

something might be repeating itself or

that those repetitions have a certain

your boss goes around the office and

you can tailor this to your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs</font>

384
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:46,220
now need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remember this is something</font>

someone's going to use this stuff you're

436
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:20,789
introducing and what's crucial for this

437
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:22,260
Oh what Sarah Connor am I going to you

438
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:24,780
know believe what would which one is the

439

real one it's a use of your product I

440
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:29,520
trust what you're saying you're being

441
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:32,190
challenged always going to be to build

442
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:35,129
credibility if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you build an intelligent</font>

443
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:37,020
system or you decide something using the

444
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:41,549
intelligent cycle and this is something

445
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:44,730
that you create over time that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font>

446
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:47,039
why intelligence work is very oriented

447
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:48,659
towards the<font color="#CCCCCC"> credibility of the sources</font>

the end of this presentation so books

there's a three prep primer start for
