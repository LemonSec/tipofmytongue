financial related crimes some that

aren't directly related to cyber but i

57
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,790
think that are interesting and there

58
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:30,200
were certainly threats out there that i

65
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,650
I'll get some of the threats and<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of</font>

66
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,209
the targets out there the malicious

67
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:46,549
software that we see and the financial

68
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:48,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">industry specifically and then some of</font>

the mitigation strategies that we try to

00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:55,130
share with<font color="#E5E5E5"> our corporate customers and</font>

71
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:56,790
best practices so just in baking 101

72
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,769
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I only saw a couple</font>

00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:04,439
the banking industry ACH e automated

clearing<font color="#E5E5E5"> place most of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the snow at a</font>

76
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:08,909
stage is because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how our payroll</font>

77
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,159
might go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> our main account or that's</font>

78
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:12,629
how we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> utility payments that we</font>

79
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:14,909
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay will get it set up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for auto</font>

80
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:18,000
deduct and that's how it comes out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

81
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:20,519
our bank account for<font color="#CCCCCC"> corporations</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to set</font>

82
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,379
up automatic clearing house payments

83
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,980
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> originate those payments and they</font>

84
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:27,659
originated them in a file and most times

85
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,340
now they'll do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> through their</font>

86
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:31,439
business internet banking sections just

87
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,939
like most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us as consumers have</font>

88
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,340
internet making<font color="#E5E5E5"> businesses have been</font>

89
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:39,060
making as well so they'll set those up

90
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:41,250
through internet banking sessions and

91
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,079
their corporate files and their

92
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,659
templates that they do through their

93
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:47,310
internet banking so keep that night just

94
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:49,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">like as we all want to endure in and</font>

95
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,299
banking and even on our mobile banking

96
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:54,120
corporations can do that just the same

97
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:57,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they can create these very large ACH</font>

98
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,099
files to do payroll to do accounts

99
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:01,650
payable they can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and do</font>

100
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:05,849
receivables and Mo Money in so we can do

101
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:07,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">these very large ACH files wire transfer</font>

102
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:10,918
wire<font color="#CCCCCC"> transfers how we would money</font>

103
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,840
through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wire system and that used to</font>

104
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:15,090
be the only real way to move<font color="#E5E5E5"> money and</font>

105
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,430
move money quickly before ACH came into

106
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:20,010
the world so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can also do wires we can</font>

107
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,639
do domestically or internationally and

108
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,830
send money

109
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,229
and the great thing about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ACH and wire</font>

110
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:27,870
transfers is it moves money and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it moves</font>

111
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:30,748
money really fast and once it gets to

112
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,849
you it's there it's available and you

113
00:04:30,749 --> 00:04:35,819
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend it immediately the bad thing</font>

114
00:04:32,849 --> 00:04:37,830
about ACH and<font color="#E5E5E5"> wire transfers is that it</font>

115
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:39,870
moves money and it moves it fast and

116
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,998
once it gets there it's available and

117
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:44,009
it's gone so it's a good and a bad thing

118
00:04:41,999 --> 00:04:45,419
all at the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> time and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then we have</font>

119
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:47,400
the good old fashioned cashier's check

120
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:49,378
and you know Google scum move money and

121
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,609
even fraudulent li-jared cashier's check

122
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:52,979
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's interesting about against</font>

123
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,539
Jack as those are a bank issued and we

124
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:56,008
cannot place the stop payment on those

125
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:57,539
so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go in to get a</font>

126
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:59,099
cashiers check in the bank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

127
00:04:57,539 --> 00:05:01,318
certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that it's guaranteed funds</font>

128
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:03,210
but a man cannot place a stop payment on

129
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:06,090
that we have to pay that if it comes in

130
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:09,270
so now we're all on the same page

131
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:12,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">malicious software everybody in this</font>

132
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:14,460
room<font color="#E5E5E5"> I led to believe knows what</font>

133
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:17,099
malicious software knows what malware is

134
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:20,549
so how is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it used and financial crime</font>

135
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:21,900
well typically we see it people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

136
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:24,689
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it installed on a computer</font>

137
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:26,400
unbeknownst to them to steal their

138
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:28,020
account credentials steal their login

139
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,479
credentials and the criminals who

140
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,339
figured out that it isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jody cell</font>

141
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,409
George Selby's personal account that has

142
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:36,000
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> money in it clearly it's not my</font>

those big corporations that have money

145
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:40,949

that and the traditional organized crime

white collar crime i'll talk about how<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

217
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,500
think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Bloods and the Crips that</font>

here at the end how they're impacting

just general<font color="#E5E5E5"> white collar</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Brent so we</font>

220
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:33,520
have to get over how does it happen it

221
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:36,370
came on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the scene few years ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

222
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">10 to 12 maybe 14 years had always first</font>

223
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:43,299
started saying account takeover

224
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:45,579
basically what happens is an email comes

225
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:47,439
in hi I walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> around at night race day I</font>

226
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,840
think the root of all evil is email I

227
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">just think that's where at all everybody</font>

228
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,760
would we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have it but if</font>

229
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:56,660
employees would quit clicking on bad

230
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:00,500
things then that things will

231
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:02,180
but an email<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes in generally and</font>

232
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,410
somebody opens up an attachment that

233
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,579
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not supposed to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open that they</font>

234
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,500
click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a link that they're not</font>

235
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:07,910
supposed to click on and that downloads

236
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,810
the malware in that malware is

237
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:13,219
specifically targeting the the internet

238
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:14,599
banking credentials and they want the

239
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,069
internet banking credentials they want

240
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:20,420
to be able to get the login information

241
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:23,990
and once they get that login information

242
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:26,149
they're able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> log in at that CFO or</font>

00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:27,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">whoever's responsible for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing the</font>

internet banking<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that company and</font>

245
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:32,660
then they're able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

246
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:35,269
big ACH files are they're able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create</font>

247
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:37,339
a wire transfer file and move that money

248
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:39,470
right awesome right out and it can be

249
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:41,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know if you have an ACH limit of</font>

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:44,600
half a million dollars we have a wire

251

the targets the<font color="#E5E5E5"> department first part of</font>

energy small and<font color="#E5E5E5"> midsize businesses</font>

256
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,850
because they don't seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the</font>

257
00:09:56,329 --> 00:10:01,550
security in place and the training the

00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:03,529
larger ones do the financial<font color="#CCCCCC"> sector city</font>

construction entities not-for-profits

261
00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:12,859
but as we all know go after anybody that

262
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:14,839
doesn't have sufficient security that

263
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,029
we've also seen it with cashier's checks

264
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:19,519
you know the seminar<font color="#CCCCCC"> requests for</font>

265
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:21,350
cashiers checks or counterfeit checks

266
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,630
and we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the financial industry</font>

267
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:27,290
we see it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like everything else</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

268
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:30,740
way to feast or famine we have seen a

269
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:32,509
huge influx of talented chefs probably

270
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,779
in the last six months we used to not

271
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:37,519
see as many and then they spike and now

272
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:40,430
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we see counterfeit checks</font>

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,350
bhangra stress for about a 4 billion

00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:55,120
large branch network but we probably see

00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:56,980
a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of counterfeit checks a day and</font>

280
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,410
we probably have at least one corporate

281
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,540
customer a week that has an influx of

282
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:06,040
cash and checks hitting so that's a

283
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:07,900
pretty big problem so once i create this

284
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,280
week Nigel an ACH file and the criminal

285
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,020
1 i've got the account credentials of a

large corporation and i logged in and

287
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:16,510
I've created this large ACH file or this

288
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,400
or all of these wire transfers I need to

289
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,900
send<font color="#E5E5E5"> that money somewhere</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so I going to</font>

290
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,209
send<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to I got to get it somewhere</font>

291
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,890
lightly here in the United States

292
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,660
sometimes it goes outside the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US but I</font>

293
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:27,910
gotta<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it somewhere now the tasty age</font>

294
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:31,209
that's all domestic I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

295
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:32,829
international ACH transactions chances

296
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:35,500
are it's going to be just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a normal</font>

297
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:37,630
domestic aviation transaction so that's

298
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,700
right here in the United<font color="#CCCCCC"> States so I</font>

299
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,410
gotta send<font color="#E5E5E5"> it somewhere so I got to find</font>

300
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,030
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> money you gotta find some people</font>

301
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:46,240
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the US and I can send this money</font>

302
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:48,280
to to their bank accounts and so you see

303
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">the work from home at going to work from</font>

304
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:55,230
home or we've got the Lonely Hearts Club

305
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:58,500
line<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm selling something on craigslist</font>

306
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:00,390
so if there's a whole myriad of

307
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,830
different ways but most times people

308
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:04,890
think they're working from home and at

309
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:06,420
some very elaborate scam that they all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

310
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,760
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is let this money come into</font>

311
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,560
my bank account and I would ride I take

312
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">it to western union</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not on</font>

313
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,119
through western union and I him to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font>

314
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:18,600
a portion of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> parsees these are the</font>

315
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,160
money mules and the systems are set up a

316
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,170
log in they<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they're really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

317
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,339
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> these people and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> log in they find</font>

318
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:25,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">out when the money is going to come in</font>

319
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:28,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much the ACH is going to be they go</font>

320
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:30,870
to the bank they withdraw money and then

321
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:32,279
they send it off western union and then

322
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:37,350
that month money is picked up by the

323
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:38,910
criminal on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other end so that's</font>

324
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:41,279
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they will not many bills</font>

325
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:43,170
oftentimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> money mules if it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds too</font>

326
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,910
good to be true law enforcement will

327
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,680
arrest them and pick them up because you

328
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:50,130
shouldn't do something that sounds too

329
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:52,680
good to be true we run into

330
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:55,560
investigations with cousin corporate

331
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,670
account takeover a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times the</font>

332
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,310
corporate account takeovers are

333
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,839
emanating from Eastern Europe so when

334
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:03,900
that money mule does send no money

335
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:05,970
western<font color="#CCCCCC"> union</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it ends up somewhere over</font>

336
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,800
in Eastern Europe and there's money

337
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:09,209
mules on the other end so there's money

338
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,949
mules over there pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the money and</font>

339
00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:12,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">there may be several layers then of</font>

340
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:14,730
mules on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other end so it's not just</font>

341
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:16,860
pick it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and I go ahead into the</font>

342
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:18,930
kingpin it goes two and three or four

343
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,250
different layers on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other end so</font>

344
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:23,430
investigations are really really

345
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:26,550
frustrating and as we all know law

346
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:27,660
enforcement<font color="#E5E5E5"> here in the US the first</font>

347
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,640
thing you do when you see a corporate

348
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,850
account takeovers first reaction is well

349
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,680
it's called the FBI kalyanji I

350
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:36,500
Alton you do call them they immediately

351
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,849
come in and they go to the corporation's

352
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,940
computer and they seized it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

353
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:43,339
start to analyze it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

354
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:45,769
jurisdiction is the United States their

355
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:49,040
jurisdiction isn't Romania so then

356
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:50,420
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> now dependent on the Romanian</font>

357
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,029
counterparts tailed them in that

358
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:55,160
investigation over there and sometimes

359
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:56,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">those Romanian counterparts may be</font>

360
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,939
corrupt and so there's those those

361
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:01,699
challenges as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> or wherever it may be</font>

362
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:03,740
so and there's no bank accounts over

363
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:04,910
there in Eastern Europe it's not like

364
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,560
they're gonna go see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bank account</font>

365
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">and get all the money back it doesn't</font>

366
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">work like that they don't have many</font>

367
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:13,670
counts like we do here so a lot of

368
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:14,690
frustrations when their is you're

369
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:19,519
dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the investigator</font>

373
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:27,380
little bit about the regulations that go

374
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:30,829
along with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we're highly regulated and</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ffiec that's a group of regulators</font>

that's your FDIC<font color="#CCCCCC"> the metal reserving SEC</font>

377
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:38,120
those who see all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those groups have</font>

378
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:40,399
come together into this council and they

379
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:44,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">cast</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> regulations and guidance and</font>

380
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:46,519
guidance generally is is those are the

00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,930
things that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> put out that financial</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">is just some things that</font>

384
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:54,709
you might want to follow or things that

385
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:58,010
are ideas and best practices this

386
00:14:54,710 --> 00:15:00,890
particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> guide's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that came out on an</font>

387
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:04,040
internet banking was not just suggested

388
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:06,830
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was it's not a regulation but you are</font>

389
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:09,110
absolutely expected to follow it and

390
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:11,150
implemented and encouraged Lincoln

391
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mountain 2001 and that's when it they</font>

392
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:14,150
came out they said look makes you know

393
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,430
this woman and it may have made<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've</font>

394
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:17,720
got going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it's really we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really like</font>

395
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:20,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">it we think it's really great your</font>

396
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,820
customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem to enjoy it but the</font>

397
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,770
username and password that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough</font>

398
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:27,320
you need to find some additional layers

399
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:29,750
of security and so you started<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing</font>

400
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,090
things like passphrases pick your

401
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,800
passphrase you know i love more pictures

402
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:36,920
challenge questions all that that's

403
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">where that came from then in 2005</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

404
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">app they updated it they said oh that</font>

405
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:42,170
the whole pass price thing is good we

406
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,400
like that we like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pictures that</font>

407
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,800
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> really great but you need to keep</font>

408
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">people airing it keep doing those layers</font>

409
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:51,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">and so you started seeing things like</font>

410
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:53,689
tokens tokens put into play we rolled

411
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:56,390
out tokens at Bankers Trust tokens are

412
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:58,490
great and look he fogging up<font color="#CCCCCC"> dinner the</font>

413
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:00,380
little little number that's on the key

414
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,690
fob and it changes every 30 seconds<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

415
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:04,490
the angle boi how's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how somebody</font>

416
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:06,080
ever going to defeat that how do you

417
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">defeat a token we roll them out within</font>

418
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:10,850
three or four<font color="#CCCCCC"> months it was defeated so</font>

419
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:13,880
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> eye to security I'm information</font>

420
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:16,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">security not to be confused with IT</font>

421
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:20,780
security we have the IT security grow

422
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:23,060
too and my IT security manager will

423
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:25,209
always say<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jody you can build a 50-foot</font>

424
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:29,109
wall that they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> always have a 50</font>

425
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:32,888
one foot ladder so 2011 the guidance was

426
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:35,649
updating it again telling us to enhance

427
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:37,029
our layered security so banks then

428
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:38,769
started doing more<font color="#E5E5E5"> how-to band</font>

429
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:40,179
authentication so you're doing the text

like an entire day like a week ago just

great you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay good they fix the</font>

514
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,909
problem but notify the bank when that

well use the firewalls encrypted VPN

always practical especially in the small

00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:01,230
locked up what we do we pay the ransom

542

do not

546
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:11,760
forget about it move on or when was the

547

last time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you backed up those files now</font>

the lesson learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is let's have</font>

549
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:18,360

<font color="#E5E5E5">have to worry about the ransom ware and</font>

train<font color="#E5E5E5"> your employees to be careful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> under</font>

553
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:26,250
come hey think we've all probably read

554
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,470
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you can pay the ransom and I</font>

555
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,809
think anymore the criminals are pretty

556
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:32,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">good about giving you the key to open it</font>

557
00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:35,970
back up the FBI will tell you don't pay

558
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:37,260
the ransom<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's certainly a risk out</font>

559
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:40,470
there we're seeing<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are customers</font>

560
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:42,629
but the biggest risk the thing that I

561
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:44,549
see at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or three times a week</font>

from our customer requesting a wire

transfer request we can usually

575
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,390
determine what those look like because

criminals have figured out is then

00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:53,150
about a wire transfer is it moves fast

and once it gets to the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> end it's</font>

615
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:40,310
inside the business<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if one employee</font>

is sending an email request for a wire

00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:50,750
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're request is legitimate</font>

all the time it can be an actual email

00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:58,580
compromised or it could just be that he

624
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,170
knows food it can be either one and

625
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:02,060
employees are falling for it all the

626
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:04,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">time a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of money is leaving this</font>

628
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,540
then

629
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,980
it's just gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> because by the time you</font>

630
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:11,080
get a lot of the financial institution

00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:13,300
the individual on the other end the

plus it's gone it's gone so and if you

637
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:26,710
can have to serve overseas and then

638
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:29,230
we're completely out of luck that is the

take off directly after this for<font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>
