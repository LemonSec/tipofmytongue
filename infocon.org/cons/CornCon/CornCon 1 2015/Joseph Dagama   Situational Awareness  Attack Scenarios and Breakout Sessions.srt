480
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:18,980
when they hacked that car use the same

00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:22,400
technology the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. use basically the</font>

00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:28,430
the centrifuges at the new plan and

484
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:33,919
create some kind of air bubble system

485
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:38,810
they accessed a 2,000 pound vehicle and

486
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:40,580
this technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been around probably</font>

488
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:47,810
Korea has developed that seeing kind of

00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:56,990
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got a facility that</font>

Jenna that<font color="#E5E5E5"> creates anhydrous ammonia you</font>

493

wanted on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a plan water on the dark web</font>

495
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:09,800
who knows so they hacked so that

496
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:13,490
individual from a remote location

497
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:18,200
accesses the anhydrite ammonia process

498
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:21,470
thereby setting up a cloud or an<font color="#CCCCCC"> event</font>

499
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:25,880
which would include evacuation and our

death any on the amount of movies the

501
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:30,800
only way to stop in hives ammonia

502
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:35,120
anybody now mix it with water that's it

503
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:38,720
air is a factor you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> take out a</font>
