1
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,570
there is no you came and he would
million dollars and they come out and

2
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:17,220
say there's just came so that's why they
talk about security awareness where I

3
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,410
think I have one calls and then have the
security awareness that goes through

4
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:28,039
things came to a conclusion and it just
gets boring just talking about this is a

5
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:34,580
nice time because it's otherwise
presentation

6
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:40,159
great-grandchildren security awareness
programs as another one that just gave

7
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:48,010
I'll say suggestions also there's a
chain talk about phishing messages

8
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:55,979
really most people saying fishing that's
a stupid human tricks that's really all

9
00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:03,689
there is at least ten players went so
attacks that could stop proactively and

10
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:07,729
only two of the 10 players actually has
anything to do with a user does

11
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:11,429
technology should I take it as well I
can talk about the Syrian electronic

12
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,200
army and why they hate me

13
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,880
by screwing with them and stuff like
that they can do that one and that's a

14
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:32,189
little bit ok so I'm pretty much covered
so don't let a sophisticated attack came

15
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:33,548
out there in the audience

16
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:49,040
702 security program was a sympathy vote
for a change

17
00:01:49,040 --> 00:02:07,580
I have electronic army was the other one
I say threatened tell and you could see

18
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:23,250
he went ok well see you just lost I will
talk about it seems like the

19
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:30,820
sophisticated intact as most most most
other people to give a damn so that's so

20
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:39,410
I'll talk to you about the president's
health care reform along with Steve Alan

21
00:02:39,410 --> 00:03:44,700
BSI actually had his presentations

22
00:03:44,700 --> 00:04:13,190
that she's so anyway let's talk about
this and language clinton also just so

23
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:28,080
down anyway this is where I am talking
about this sophisticated basically what

24
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,070
is going on in every time there's to
check out there somebody comes out my

25
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:38,530
god this was such a sophisticated attack
we never stopped I was actually earlier

26
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:48,909
this week I don't even know where
conference he don't have a former

27
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:56,080
sheriff and then they have like the
chief security officers of electronic

28
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:03,710
media don't know these people were
saying somebody said that wasn't done

29
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:08,688
preventable attack and i would like to
bring their tax

30
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:26,879
you know that our new me so how do you
say that thing was that this was well

31
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:44,329
maybe inflation coming after them and
stuff online sorry you know I was there

32
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:55,339
I am sitting there was not successfully
financially successful eventually it

33
00:05:55,339 --> 00:06:02,929
means you have a stack of stuff so in my
opinion every time the two million

34
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:08,508
dollars to come out and say was a
sophisticated program in place to

35
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:15,749
prevent such attacks and the thing is
there's something else about him just

36
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:25,269
like ok so why is this the media loves a
good story you know and the security

37
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:36,150
security out there you know what they're
doing is she why is this one

38
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:46,120
how many people have a credit card
JPMorgan Chase people in the security

39
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:52,420
professional seventy million credit card
were stolen just the same time

40
00:06:52,420 --> 00:07:06,460
breaches no idea why did nobody here
that JPMorgan these places are

41
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:12,190
successful and what happened all of a
sudden the news this is a good story

42
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:28,150
about the same time that everybody is
really know this is terrible that was a

43
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:38,340
sophisticated things but this was the
same as it was ridiculous we love to get

44
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:52,710
a good story and there's too much out
there to get the home to but so so so it

45
00:07:52,710 --> 00:08:02,409
was found that it was all about nobody
cared that basically somebody official

46
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:09,029
really really really really mad security
10 you talk about who you know this must

47
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:11,679
be rushing credit card

48
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:20,169
water all over but the cyber war is the
cold war now we're stealing credit cards

49
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:24,399
and everybody was horrified by this
whole thing but the media season 26

50
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:29,189
hearing people to do it you know they
love to jump on and give them the story

51
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:36,209
because we like to say you know that's a
separate issue so why this matters to us

52
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:41,859
when we're here security professionals
everybody's thinking you know what our

53
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:50,310
job security people jobs jobs too many
tax but on the other hand

54
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:56,739
and if we hear too sophisticated
everybody's completely focus on how and

55
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:02,710
why these things were happening people
ever heard you know the story the sunny

56
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:07,490
1100 s hope you feel better please

57
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:14,880
hardly you know everybody say the whole
fabric of the internet was hardly

58
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,529
Boehner's ability

59
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:22,430
almost everywhere in the world has
hardly vulnerability raise your credit

60
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,739
card

61
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:32,040
traffic over the last two years now have
to go back and figure out what your

62
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,459
password

63
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:45,100
like sitting there thinking how many
people these days the last year's every

64
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,690
bit the last few years back

65
00:09:48,690 --> 00:10:03,130
place it's kinda like the person was
from Iowa to 11 it was the answer was

66
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:11,560
around their house but you don't take
because he was afraid that there was a

67
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,050
guy who's gonna protect

68
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:23,370
so it's pretty much covered his house
the whole news done taken everything

69
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:40,170
might be hit by how that was so
distraught he has bad things were but

70
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,319
again everybody loves

71
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:50,010
season all this but the question is why
doesn't your answering stupid question

72
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:59,029
but there's a lot of multi-factor
authentication Hartley was hoping that

73
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:04,680
somehow they make all those news stories
useful rampage new stores trashed when

74
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,349
they say by the way to change your
password

75
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:14,060
ok I want to be clever said that how
many people's phone users find a way you

76
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:23,239
can't do anything about it changes you
know to import the same fabric that is a

77
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:29,120
good idea to change your password on
your faces so anyway to change the

78
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,790
picture of an unstoppable any bad
security is easy because instead of

79
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:40,599
people from Sony be strung out by the
proverbial change what happened

80
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:51,290
everybody knows more than 300 North
Korea North Korea just kind of their

81
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:57,069
time but other organizations

82
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:06,610
north korea's so what are we gonna do we
don't have the budget to do these people

83
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:17,029
so we'll just continue to be the next
thing you know

84
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:26,089
preventable exactly preventable that's
like saying well pretty much expected

85
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:41,360
six months or so so when I'm trying to
get out of every time you hear so you

86
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:52,160
should be thinking way is 99% of 99.99%
of the time is not really screwed up on

87
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,630
this program you should be completely
failed

88
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:02,240
basic precautions they worry about 100
sophisticated attack and was a

89
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:10,180
sophisticated attack you know what is in
place 00

90
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:26,020
message 000 this is a little user let me
know there's a loan facility just you

91
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:30,370
know that's actually what is a
sophisticated and brazen you're going to

92
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:35,370
hear a little bit but the problem is
people get away with calling an

93
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:40,280
unsophisticated because two million
dollars they will do problema

94
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:45,640
sophisticated older so I got on the
criteria

95
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:51,680
sophisticated ok somebody million
dollars should come out of the news and

96
00:13:51,680 --> 00:14:01,260
say was a suicide attack you pay for
damage to the fact that you are working

97
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,720
for your security

98
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:13,610
playing sophisticated attacks you know
the reason that I was really

99
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:26,680
he he didn't vision and you also and
then by god damn David

100
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:36,479
central command you know they had TV 50
inch TV station they were attacked by my

101
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,579
sis and again and the world was
devastated

102
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:52,699
give you a little spoiler alert they put
their passwords on TV not a good works

103
00:14:52,700 --> 00:15:08,040
on TV as I mean seriously looking back I
am sitting here and I don't get it

104
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:20,519
I mean I want marriage for another one
everybody was going to say later I'll

105
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:28,149
never get 02 02 2010 according to
somebody with a sophisticated attack

106
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:39,529
well I get really cranky see also turn
around and help you when you are sitting

107
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:45,430
there and trying to justify security
program so many things you can do all

108
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:52,829
this news is great i mean this is de lo
target was fired still have no idea why

109
00:15:52,829 --> 00:16:01,310
the CEO and was fired she's information
security officer said don't worry about

110
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:08,268
it that really should be though she
struck out to drive everybody you know

111
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:17,370
to help your cause we can help you lose
your job you know your job if you let me

112
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:28,160
how we can help you keep you company up
and running we use to save a lot of jobs

113
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:37,019
are to keep your company at the news in
most cases no such thing as perfect see

114
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:43,200
anybody ever tell you there are some
combination

115
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:53,710
think you are a lot of which is very
much alive either ways so he will

116
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:59,340
highlight vulnerabilities and say look
here's all these hacks and the fact of

117
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:07,120
the matter is completely agree with
these security measures in place but I

118
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:20,089
need the same as everybody else going to
cover a little bit and that's the reason

119
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:31,750
I'm hoping you don't have to actually
put together a whole bunch of other

120
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:38,010
stuff you know maybe don't mind telling
people that actually things in place you

121
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:45,090
can go on sale of these things in place
these days of those attacked so we have

122
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:54,409
a program that let's look at how did
thar his turn to the essentially went

123
00:17:54,410 --> 00:18:04,320
through many other things but basically
the message we're so email to one of

124
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:10,300
their vendors who had access to the
vendor network that allows managers to

125
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:17,309
go through a stock buyback so they went
ahead

126
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:24,519
fishy message gotta be used for the
better known as the better then they

127
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:34,570
went ahead and low-level access and then
they fished around that sounds too

128
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:41,309
sophisticated network of the network was
a completely flat network with no

129
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:50,210
segmentation station was so trivial to
break through and through that the

130
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:57,570
configuration in other words and
services software updates to systems all

131
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,689
over the place

132
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:02,279
last companies have these configuration
management and they were really good

133
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:18,610
thing they do these basically I know
protection so hurtful when the sale

134
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:24,570
systems simultaneously they found
service

135
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:39,450
the target customer next target is
actually possibly the largest credit

136
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:44,679
card company in the world is a shooter
on target train cars and that's a big

137
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:48,639
thing that most people don't realize so
they're like in many cases a bigger

138
00:19:48,639 --> 00:19:57,250
credit card issuer credit card she was
just about every day and a self-funded

139
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,019
which one target has to go ahead

140
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:06,169
numbers against their own systems which
is kind of embarrassing actually better

141
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:16,419
selves I guess so it was always able to
go ahead and download the mass text

142
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:35,220
exultation services company did you
steal duties I'm gonna go live date over

143
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:46,540
time finding some reasonable security
programs they might see all this track

144
00:20:46,540 --> 00:21:03,550
back so I just wanted to give a point in
time to see what happens

145
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:09,220
course except for the fact that
supposedly dose and fire I system newly

146
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:14,850
installed in place and the levee system
was completely in order to see so the

147
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:22,490
time so it's a new system to worry about
it and she's still there just became

148
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:33,040
very possibly could have faced the
reality was criminals or whatever people

149
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:40,870
think my new one of her sons and let's
face it how much time do this attack

150
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,209
from start to finish

151
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:47,010
you look at the time line of credit
online thousands who are three months

152
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:55,710
millions of dollars in three months time
just to steal a million dollars into

153
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,200
place

154
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:14,269
people are so in their basement
somewhere else to go ahead as well

155
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:30,500
basically established you know they hope
she only five ppl yeah they were stopped

156
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:41,700
a few times this became my originals
were at work she messages or should have

157
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:50,269
been expected on top of that there's no
indication of course and the bad air

158
00:22:50,269 --> 00:23:02,309
conditioning controls and stuff for
those of you that don't matter you know

159
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:11,970
it's expected you know that's going to
happen even though the configuration

160
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:19,559
management systems day still share one
point sales systems industry standard

161
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:22,980
practice to sales systems wireless

162
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:28,930
basically go ahead and say is this point

163
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:40,530
has a very small and it says this is one
of the very poor

164
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:45,730
target getting the recent crash update
to the things you know the Verizon thing

165
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:57,260
they go good Takamine happy and that's
what's the most embarrassing part this

166
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:03,600
is the most in the world and it was
completely unnecessary because I promise

167
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:11,980
you I don't know who they are but these
two people that exact same time it was

168
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:27,120
so now let's talk about the entire life
was north korea

169
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:48,159
it was getting the new sources that
match or something like that

170
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:58,900
jail so but basically has no one needs
an attacker's did was they went ahead

171
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:04,560
through late to finish slightly
administrators worked with your online

172
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,270
sources figured out who the
administrators

173
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:12,260
phishing messages that said we need to
confirm your Apple I T

174
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:19,030
ministry apparently trees that personal
task to ideas or administrator password

175
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:21,330
no multi-factor authentication

176
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:29,730
attackers to fully complete lack network
so you can go anywhere they want to mail

177
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:39,900
service availability again completely
flat out probably safely assume that was

178
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:45,450
so they want to download email and
download thing no daily prevention was

179
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:49,390
on the network to stop the stuff from
coming on and they got access to the

180
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:55,070
movie service downloaded all the movies
and everything like that and was like an

181
00:25:55,070 --> 00:26:07,370
industry where they install malware onto
the system that pushed down to where all

182
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:11,899
the PCs in the organization and then

183
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:19,910
you know all these systems are pricks
however what really happened at the end

184
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:30,760
of the day and the next day so the
attacks in the attack

185
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:50,320
fairly their ideas what you're really
tried I mean come on the budget as well

186
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,669
but they still pain and the invite a
million dollars to come out and say it

187
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:57,620
was a sophisticated attacks then had
enough political science the FBI

188
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:05,050
actually the FBI said nineteen percent
of companies would have also failed to

189
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:10,870
stop the attacks that tells me that he
percent of corporate security programs

190
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:23,639
out there and only 10% so we're very
sophisticated hell no malware detected

191
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:33,720
tax year so go this Gary ok so people
Dark Soul is essentially North Korea

192
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:39,610
attacked South Korea and some USA the
same now where was used in the Dark Soul

193
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:42,060
attacks was used in the attacks

194
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:46,740
community

195
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:53,730
blacklist of the malware will try to do
you know any antivirus program should be

196
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:57,960
able to detect malware installed on
systems before I had the opportunity to

197
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:03,260
iraq indication they had no worries

198
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:16,150
like you know whether it was talking to
your Google verification and there was

199
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:21,470
any indication why there should be an
administrator

200
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:28,240
crew is going to die likewise sony's
most valuable intellectual property are

201
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:35,620
there any good for these people you know
from north korea including police to

202
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:45,780
stop them from being down burn DVDs and
so better quality movies vying store so

203
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:49,480
you know there are so many factors

204
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:55,230
passwords respect so that what happened
was you know the password to the

205
00:28:55,230 --> 00:29:06,170
darkside malware that really really bad
when you can change the past so I gave

206
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:14,370
this presentation we are ready to be a
big smile on her face was one of those

207
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:18,250
days

208
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:39,730
really happened to your cell she was
really friendly and she's like ok I'm

209
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:57,100
thinking freely enough really like the
whole thing was just so every defamation

210
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,270
against

211
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:10,950
ok so let's talk about how is that ok so
now let's talk about something you

212
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:17,420
thought this was horrifying to the world
what happened to the state's essential

213
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:31,640
human Central Command which is in charge
of like the Middle East region

214
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:39,120
we cannot defend against I just
structure over if people don't realize

215
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,260
what it is it's really easy

216
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:46,990
protecting these accounts were questions
later

217
00:30:46,990 --> 00:31:00,120
actually the idea that is available the
password was prolly share one person's

218
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:08,139
body oil and team he likewise you to get
over it

219
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:20,760
yes they went ahead and put up a nice
place to meet with both really hope are

220
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:31,850
so useless to Central Command those but
anyway but this is a major new 65 mom to

221
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:39,320
bond with me but you know it's like TV 5
world so what happened was they went

222
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:45,510
down they took down the sideline piece
into the whole bunch of other stuff

223
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:51,300
attack on free speech because a major TV
station was taken down but even the

224
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,480
French people

225
00:31:53,480 --> 00:32:06,030
know all these people were researched it
and you can actually interviewing

226
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:19,030
somebody in the studio this behind me
down and it was almost like live you too

227
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:35,730
bad you know the password password there

228
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:57,850
data available i mean it's like you know
so they went ahead in my work you know

229
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:13,080
and I wonder whether you know these
people were more and you have any

230
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:17,770
statutory profession that these
vulnerabilities were allowed to exist

231
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:29,300
but anyway so I can get pretty much
cover that nobody really knows but again

232
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,470
it doesn't matter

233
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:51,630
do I really have to say on TV 3d TV
without knowledge and the problem

234
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:59,820
but I swear if you don't know this is a
stupid question or whatever there's no

235
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:05,189
there's no such thing as a stupid user
account password implicit on TV

236
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:19,240
ok so now we have the IRS speech so the
IRS 304,000 records were actually days

237
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,520
inside

238
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:29,889
records were compromised through the IRS
transfer function 201 these things do

239
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:42,179
this in detail and then they said there
were 200,000 and 400,000 so indications

240
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:50,099
of course the IRS information only

241
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:57,499
leave the taxpayer lot they were able to
authenticate so there's something there

242
00:34:57,499 --> 00:35:04,839
the IRS commissioner said that he was
committed by storm pummels with

243
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:21,190
computers higher now for the IRS to
grams of the commissioner of the IRS

244
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:30,519
seriously you gotta think what is going
on there you know what these people in

245
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:38,299
the criminal actually do criminals god
they basically say fifty million dollars

246
00:35:38,299 --> 00:35:39,579
in the process

247
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:50,630
yeah they did this was the IRS basically
said that basically said if you want two

248
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:54,410
copies of your records you don't get
your transcripts of whatever of your

249
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:58,930
last year's tax records please come onto
the internet and do the following

250
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:08,509
information to prove your identity they
used an experienced so

251
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:17,220
to experience reporting agency one
function of the very few changes her

252
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:23,790
credit card and they want to confirm
your identity before and they say

253
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:34,610
something along the lines of fact along
the lines of how how much do you pay 40

254
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:46,510
$200 5,000 5,000 do you live you know
which address was previously associated

255
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,080
with you

256
00:36:48,080 --> 00:37:03,730
Main Street 2nd Avenue or short house
road or something like that and those

257
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:17,910
questions which I promise you can go out
and buy $25 or $30 cheaper you can go

258
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:26,970
ahead so somehow least 400,000 reports
that they were able to attempt to

259
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:29,430
compromise and then 200

260
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:41,450
they were able to answer this question
became attack you know something no one

261
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:55,710
knows what we needed was a credit report
done that they went undetected and his

262
00:37:55,710 --> 00:38:04,440
attempts let me ask you this question is
you see 400002 download people's credit

263
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:13,300
reports from a good idea dressed in
russia now are you saying she we had a

264
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:19,960
whole whole lot of american citizens
live in a really big apartment building

265
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:34,170
temperamental you know something in all
honesty I don't blame them for that

266
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:39,910
commercial services as education that's
legit however

267
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:51,339
protection so it means you have a better
protection and you don't know I should

268
00:38:51,339 --> 00:38:55,720
not rely upon information that only
people

269
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:02,640
because taxpayers and then you know
where my infomercial service which that

270
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:13,080
he's a commercial services from other
people however indicating people however

271
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:21,890
the reality is you're sitting there
saying access taxpayers question I'm a

272
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:32,640
bad bad there's a whole bunch of intense
and once there's probably a bad thing

273
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,339
because

274
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:38,359
reaction might not be complete

275
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:53,440
there's no such thing as perfect
security and you can also has to not get

276
00:39:53,440 --> 00:40:04,580
users to access so reasonable protection
education but they were not a combined

277
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:08,380
with that email

278
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:15,160
commercial crime fraud detection

279
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:22,609
president target from MTV sorry this is
almost along the lines of saying you

280
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:30,970
know TV but all that date in the rain
out don't worry about that that's a bad

281
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:36,990
thing we aren't many messages better
awareness program people that's not

282
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:42,770
necessarily in their signature business
networks from your embarrassing to say

283
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:49,180
something like that but way to stop and
even in nineteen billion the FBI believe

284
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:56,060
ninety percent of you are completely
clueless modern the configuration and

285
00:40:56,060 --> 00:41:03,020
stuff like that to ensure there is doing
better monitoring of daily prevention so

286
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:13,450
I don't know you know you look into it
once and on wall street journalists

287
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:18,430
attack multi-factor authentication for
administrator

288
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:28,000
organization but most organizations do
change in administration obviously you

289
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,330
can't prevent administrators reusing
their personal close to know unless

290
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:38,549
you're really a true insurers soon as to
whether or not these people are doing so

291
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:47,580
but now we're hiring firing usual
activities on the prevention of

292
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:55,549
monitoring the whole bunch of stuff so
that was used by the Dark Souls should

293
00:41:55,550 --> 00:42:01,970
have been easily detectable network
especially also apparently totally

294
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:06,390
discounted what would be considered if
it's right intelligence which told

295
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,299
Sunday night away

296
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:28,860
you know this dictator whose kinda so
well gee maybe they'll do the same thing

297
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:38,580
but I totally embarrassing to say do not
think your password on TV I don't know

298
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:44,220
how many opportunities to do so but
should you ever do so

299
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:51,779
TV he truly and multi-factor
authentication you know just somebody

300
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:56,270
steals multi-factor authentication
probably there

301
00:42:56,270 --> 00:43:04,400
and everything like that

302
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:17,789
something John recommendation to use
something of this nature may be too

303
00:43:17,789 --> 00:43:29,650
little sis is this year he has to be a
noble security functionality should

304
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:40,799
national level of risk the lower risk is
properly sing religious party actually

305
00:43:40,799 --> 00:43:49,410
figured this much further

306
00:43:49,410 --> 00:44:10,020
so I was like I said you see sure he has
to buy them now and yes maybe the

307
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:16,560
functionality and the level of effort
and you should not be expensive but in

308
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:27,130
that case they need to proactively
determined to be ok preventing the OPM I

309
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:33,610
really don't care you know I'm really no
given name and/or now you know 0 the

310
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:39,660
attacks the reality of the situation is
there's a defendant when you look at you

311
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:52,279
know there should be multiple layers of
security that has got to be critical of

312
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:56,310
everything because you can't expect
there's no such thing as a perfect

313
00:44:56,310 --> 00:45:05,150
security but when you have something
that is classified systems

314
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:14,670
this is another factor if I were there
was a security service and everything

315
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:29,289
was classified Defense Security Service
to cut government security services they

316
00:45:29,289 --> 00:45:37,660
pretty much budgeted out the Defense
Security Service plans so what do you

317
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:42,788
need to go to kill

318
00:45:42,789 --> 00:45:51,490
think about that too many times people
budget compromise were on the Department

319
00:45:51,490 --> 00:46:11,038
of Interior Department of Interior
services it was cheap dates back to you

320
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:20,900
don't care and nobody cares about you
but I way

321
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:33,700
message just this message it doesn't
happen where China was able to

322
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:45,669
compromise the security so gives
Microsoft Excel program you will not

323
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:50,220
have the ability to run delicious macros
and stuff like that so there should be

324
00:46:50,220 --> 00:47:07,640
zero day this year and he did better
than the entire china probably will

325
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,819
anyway this detection in place

326
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:16,580
operation those flies in this
presentation in Singapore in Singapore

327
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:24,860
heard of this was the most devastating I
wanted to do was say you know because

328
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:29,830
frankly I'm talking about her coming
from north korea

329
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:38,170
all over the place from different places
they're attacking these are you s

330
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:47,390
attacks targeted attacks all over the
place is basically this operation or

331
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:49,799
other similar country

332
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:57,820
Southeast Asian countries anywhere using
Microsoft Office latest version of

333
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:00,890
Microsoft Office but similar things

334
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:08,390
multi-factor authentication and
therefore you sure you ok let's talk

335
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:14,620
about real sophisticated attack how many
people are about the earthquake many

336
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:23,839
pretty much access those people are also
being frankly best use of taxpayer money

337
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:49,200
if people do those operating facilities
Airgas no less that was supposedly the

338
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:54,629
equation you know he had a whole bunch
of different they were so good you know

339
00:48:54,630 --> 00:49:02,270
that basically they intercepted machines
that deliver and install malware malware

340
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:03,890
was embedded into the

341
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:10,480
the software is apparently so good this
was disclosed by the first which is

342
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:21,970
going well you don't really have you
know it's there because this was 14

343
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:30,339
years and nobody knew was there fourteen
years where computers and god knows that

344
00:49:30,339 --> 00:49:37,529
you know in reality all year 3 months

345
00:49:37,529 --> 00:49:47,069
fourteen years and now not only if
they're talking about to your research

346
00:49:47,069 --> 00:49:56,720
that's really awesome I think you got
your crazy wherever and however already

347
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:04,879
got to do what they are trying to break
in the system tray negotiations the

348
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:15,089
Iranian stuff and depressed areas they
try to negotiations so get over that

349
00:50:15,089 --> 00:50:20,490
time this was a sophisticated attack

350
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:30,609
here's the thing was a ruling Miller vs
house 1975 so you don't really

351
00:50:30,609 --> 00:50:38,019
sophisticated attacks and sophisticated
attacks the reality of it and you know

352
00:50:38,019 --> 00:50:51,049
it's hard to figure out you know not how
you know apt attacks but first let's

353
00:50:51,049 --> 00:51:00,339
break down and yes it's appropriate
parties people persisted in other words

354
00:51:00,339 --> 00:51:14,160
these days means he's trying so these
people are persisted in advance to be an

355
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:30,788
advanced security security but you know
you see it but it's much easier so tired

356
00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:40,900
there are a lot of selling my names are
telling me I don't know why but anyway

357
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:55,299
so we were joking around and that's what
it's like to be safe zone this stuff

358
00:51:55,299 --> 00:52:06,759
seriously trying to define criteria is
more like a very program you're not here

359
00:52:06,759 --> 00:52:21,449
right now I was like myself too low but
not sophisticated attack is that it is

360
00:52:21,449 --> 00:52:31,380
not as sophisticated attacks in Europe
there you know frankly many ways to

361
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:38,819
prevent phishing messages these days
most users and users are so many ways to

362
00:52:38,819 --> 00:52:46,808
block but again and stupidity is not a
sophisticated attack you know I'm just

363
00:52:46,809 --> 00:52:53,849
doing the question how many of you in
this room includes understand the last

364
00:52:53,849 --> 00:52:57,029
three years

365
00:52:57,029 --> 00:52:59,880
meanwhile I'm guessing

366
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:09,130
I mean seriously though most people most
confident people are not only five

367
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:15,640
percent of users ninety percent of
damage so yes some people were out there

368
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,288
but one's

369
00:53:17,289 --> 00:53:32,380
2022 World is not sophisticated malware
you should you know is not a

370
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:38,200
sophisticated attack against Sony so now
we're shooting detected that you know

371
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:44,480
again as a sign of poor sophistication
of a security program so it's a sign of

372
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,259
the CAC

373
00:53:47,259 --> 00:53:50,500
will likely just love you too

374
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:58,609
password is not a good password password
is there to follow so you gotta figure

375
00:53:58,609 --> 00:54:04,200
out if you can get a password there was
poor poor parents were it was not a

376
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:10,140
sophisticated attack user awareness
exploited with a poor awareness and so

377
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:11,170
are you

378
00:54:11,170 --> 00:54:17,569
I apologize for not getting through but
here's a critical factor most security

379
00:54:17,569 --> 00:54:22,680
awareness programs are not the most
security awareness programs are trained

380
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:32,529
training by definition is providing
people with knowledge so what's this

381
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:38,520
training is show somebody sees his
training he shows up a video and

382
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:46,309
password has special characters

383
00:54:46,309 --> 00:55:00,680
password is changed everything they
decided to move past seven characters

384
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:12,470
characters the user click see and that's
what happens

385
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:16,910
average haitians

386
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:33,649
so let me ask how to fish around from
first thing you do I will tell you when

387
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:36,230
you open up

388
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:47,500
the messages say these fish fishy
messages so I used to like this so

389
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:54,130
what's the message is never reached the
end user so you're training users had to

390
00:55:54,130 --> 00:56:03,700
text messages that is 100% TVs and even
if you have what do you mean you're

391
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:12,830
training which is just what does not
think about not letting tailgaters

392
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:20,410
there's nothing nothing about any other
security awareness so if you have a

393
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:24,680
computer based training of fishing you
have to train crew room

394
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:36,190
well as secure a comprehensive program
for covering today unless you don't

395
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:42,119
wanna billion we didn't get most attacks
out their abilities I briefly mentioned

396
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:47,460
general

397
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:57,830
microsoft office all these things you
know systems engineering systems for

398
00:56:57,830 --> 00:57:01,560
president despite the fact is plastered
all over the news

399
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:07,770
despite the fact that it everywhere how
many people like color red crews were

400
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:16,030
the most likely they're heading into you
you know look it up because what happens

401
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:21,290
to the September 11th attacks you know
there was a vulnerability that came with

402
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:31,020
the FBI released this press statement
about this new vulnerability sorry to

403
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:37,450
read basically exploited vulnerabilities
SQL Microsoft SQL Server which was

404
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:42,250
released three months before was bad

405
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:47,330
billion dollars worth of damage three
billion dollars so you must really not

406
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:51,930
worth of damage completely known
vulnerability that should pack

407
00:57:51,930 --> 00:58:02,020
September 11 have described as well

408
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:06,890
might be terrorist-related

409
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:10,720
ok so excited to be on CNN

410
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:17,439
then call me back to russel
terrorist-related it's just I know well

411
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:24,260
you know this is for CNN I go for a
Cause two billion dollars in damage to

412
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:34,400
750 million think this is a good
financial started but again only six

413
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,680
months nine months and it should be
completely prevented

414
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:45,098
multi-factor authentication not in use
our users are going to eventually give

415
00:58:45,099 --> 00:58:59,990
up their password or anything else
that's why he is available for free

416
00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:08,000
Yahoo Google away for free and most
companies turned on that but we got

417
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:14,670
stock has were reused but still
multi-factor authentication will stop

418
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:19,900
99% of social engineering attacks that
compromise and all that sort of stuff

419
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:30,540
like JPMorgan Chase we change Morgan
Chase multi-factor authentication

420
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:39,580
your credit card was not in the news and
then arrested five people in a couple

421
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:41,130
weeks ago I think

422
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:44,460
track down five people

423
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:49,940
deal about us- but still

424
00:59:49,940 --> 01:00:00,730
Israel attacked us those 2010 that's who
he is anyway

425
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:12,309
past due to the lack of multi-factor
authentication mechanisms of northern

426
01:00:12,309 --> 01:00:16,700
ireland place every organization if you
have anything substantial intrusion

427
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:24,288
detection prevention should be there are
there should be network monitoring is

428
01:00:24,289 --> 01:00:40,640
yourself and your movie valuable things
in the network while you're not looking

429
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,819
for that is really

430
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:50,160
and don't ignore morning sounds like you
know is is target you know like your

431
01:00:50,160 --> 01:01:01,839
crime so poor network segmentation plus
you know I mentioned so I shouldn't

432
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:07,960
target there's also a lack of a better
term there's also stated that works one

433
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:14,030
of the biggest state industrial control
their industrial control numbers and

434
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:18,910
everything else our flag networks and I
neighbor presentation about 45 years ago

435
01:01:18,910 --> 01:01:33,740
it or it's a kind of take down the power
and then find it was funny dog and

436
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:44,569
watching him because he's a really
stupid I mean just look at jesse is that

437
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:50,060
person and I just follies

438
01:01:50,060 --> 01:02:01,000
floor and that's not just ok

439
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:17,920
but this time I'm running my
presentation and business networks

440
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:28,180
systems can you send somebody official
message and their system this is just

441
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:41,540
two people over their PCs pretty much
control over our systems and somehow so

442
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:50,170
that's a critical link for network
segmentation using by the way to the NBA

443
01:02:50,170 --> 01:03:04,510
players put out the exact same problem I
highlighted when the NRC was trying to

444
01:03:04,510 --> 01:03:09,850
tell you I heard statements are
completely false and everybody was lying

445
01:03:09,850 --> 01:03:17,009
entirely and learn what are you talking
about

446
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:31,950
user count how many people most
companies give people user's PC you

447
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:36,220
shouldn't do that so what we've got to
make sure that people have all the

448
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:49,649
necessary privileges so it's whatever
either way all these things are what we

449
01:03:49,650 --> 01:04:02,950
consider any of these things of life and
his case this is the place and so on but

450
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:05,069
anyway you can get these are

451
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:16,620
whatever reasons behind impact our
ability to do our job to stop that you

452
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:25,140
know are employed by complete morons you
know the IRS commissioner said those

453
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:34,799
people a lot so much did it doesn't
matter if people have a lot of good

454
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:38,960
smart people who are being discriminated
because somebody didn't want to take a

455
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:44,060
Bowling Congress so that's what you
really need to look at when he runs

456
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:56,160
Vista to attack by DePaul school lunch
program by to fall only really the only

457
01:04:56,160 --> 01:05:11,270
people like China and Russia this kind
of those people they do something really

458
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:20,480
damaging things too much but I promise
you my grand North Korea will win but I

459
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:26,540
was much more later cause damage than
anybody else and also any kind of pissed

460
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:30,490
off at home but also going to
troubleshoot

461
01:05:30,490 --> 01:05:42,819
control trader who just won the 2006
otherwise he just goes two pieces of

462
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:49,430
information that might do for the rest
of the world lots of people will be on

463
01:05:49,430 --> 01:06:00,618
the way here is that he is real we we
just interview John Haggerty clothes

464
01:06:00,619 --> 01:06:09,510
aren't going to be the secretary of
homeland security and all that sort of

465
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:20,090
stuff and then sometimes going on in
topics like what you can tell us the

466
01:06:20,090 --> 01:06:28,770
latest video and trying to find us to
exactly what they want they catch the

467
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:36,670
only gradually intelligence and we
should be staying for the people

468
01:06:36,670 --> 01:06:42,770
protecting us it was a sophisticated
attack for taking advantage of an attack

469
01:06:42,770 --> 01:06:54,950
taking advantage of an answer questions
with questions Iranian border or desire

470
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:56,509
to jam

471
01:06:56,510 --> 01:07:00,740
I mean the Russians and Chinese of the
building is there any

472
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:08,819
russia and China probably have more
ability Iran's I ran has more potential

473
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:13,960
desire to cause damage must place of a
filter whether or not people want to

474
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:25,910
hear that there's much less desire and
I'm not talking about just didn't read

475
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:29,569
reviews with general case you used to be
the director of the CIA

476
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:34,010
here's the following Korea

477
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:38,760
you keep all the sanctions on iraq they
have nothing to lose

478
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:48,360
has nothing to lose it really doesn't
matter what I ran for a sec

479
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:56,360
really really they're not going to do
that so the incentives

480
01:07:56,360 --> 01:08:08,070
devastating style is not as strong you
know some cases of beer and has nothing

481
01:08:08,070 --> 01:08:28,080
to do with foreign policy is literally
created provocation he is a serial I'm

482
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:39,130
trying my cock roaches roaches a great
defensive the Arab world but was later

483
01:08:39,130 --> 01:08:46,529
really care unless they are engraved
pewter really what happened was a close

484
01:08:46,529 --> 01:08:51,830
cooperation to get be I wasn't true
security have to third party i mean they

485
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:55,670
have to see it

486
01:08:55,670 --> 01:09:09,190
they have they have actually really not
attack attack and implementing

487
01:09:09,189 --> 01:09:17,649
highlighted house created the greatest
glory hole attack to the security caused

488
01:09:17,649 --> 01:09:24,679
a lot of security professional website
along so that they can go ahead and make

489
01:09:24,679 --> 01:09:32,859
some friends and everything and instead
of trying to get worried home attack all

490
01:09:32,859 --> 01:09:45,420
they did was a job so much and i'll tell
you how it works

491
01:09:45,420 --> 01:10:01,510
electronic national news is I know he's
serious I was talking to the bus and the

492
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:17,150
bus ok but who are you that these people
are facing all of my data to get back to

493
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:18,360
somebody else

494
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:35,269
intended just 200 new friend request
three days before Twitter followers

495
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:50,580
separate issue or questions I'll stick
around as I don't think it's in this

496
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:50,840
room
