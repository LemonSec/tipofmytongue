00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,360
subject today is is inside the uh

33
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,920
unlikely romance um basically just uh

34
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,000
for some backstory of who i am i'm the

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,840
the founder chairman and cto of bug

36
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,920
crowd i started off as founder ceo

37
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,080
brought a new ceo in uh probably about

38
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,360
four years ago at this point i'm in the

39
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,400
chairman cto capacity now uh also the

40
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,040
founder of the disclose io project which

41
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,520
which we'll touch on a little bit um

42
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,479
i've been in security pretty much since

43
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,000
i finished high school from from a

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,600
career standpoint uh you know grew up

45
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,360
hacking stuff as a kid

46
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,360
um i basically tripped over into a into

47
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,960
an i.t engineering job

48
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,720
out of high school and and realized that

49
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,240
i could

50
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,240
you know break into stuff and and uh do

51
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,960
you know bad person things um in a good

52
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,240
context and actually turn it into a

53
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,079
legitimate career so you know i was

54
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,200
hooked at that point been doing that

55
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,880
ever since um

56
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,399
but crowd

57
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,320
basically you know

58
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,560
i got to the point um from from a career

59
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,200
standpoint where i had done a fair bit

60
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,880
of technical work moved across and done

61
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,640
a fair bit of solutions and architecture

62
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,119
and sales kind of front of house type

63
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,679
work those two experiences got together

64
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,200
and conspired i got in my head i wanted

65
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,040
to be an entrepreneur so i broke bad and

66
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,720
started working on that stuff and and we

67
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,720
eventually uh formed spug crowd which

68
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,160
actually pioneered the crowd source

69
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,200
security as a service space we didn't

70
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,640
invent bug bounty or vulnerability

71
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,239
disclosure but we were the first to come

72
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,400
out and basically intermediate and try

73
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
to make it easier and more useful for

74
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,160
everyone um

75
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,800
and that worked that's you know nine

76
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,360
years nine years ten years ago now um

77
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,879
started working on that and obviously a

78
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,480
lot's happened since then um that's

79
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,840
that's really the foundation for a lot

80
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,599
of what i'll be speaking about today

81
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,519
proud aussie as i just mentioned and if

82
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,800
you know you didn't catch that before

83
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,560
you're probably hearing it in the accent

84
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,720
uh husband father of two and yeah as i

85
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,040
said i actually normally live uh in in

86
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,080
san francisco we've been there um

87
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,080
pretty much since the seed round of bug

88
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,599
crowd uh

89
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,040
you know doing doing the startup thing

90
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,480
and growing the business uh in the in

91
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,800
the us we actually returned to australia

92
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,280
uh just the head of covert uh in march

93
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,560
of last year

94
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,680
on account of family and different

95
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,440
things like that not wanting to get

96
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,879
separated from being able to look after

97
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,640
parents and whatnot so it's definitely

98
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,480
been a mixed up mixed up you know 18

99
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,680
months or so i think everyone's got a

100
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,040
version of that and

101
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,120
um definitely not complaining too much

102
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,040
but that's that's kind of where things

103
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,720
are all at right now very much looking

104
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,480
forward to getting back to the us at

105
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,680
some point in time in the future and

106
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,040
being able to do this this sort of thing

107
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,959
in person again but that's where we're

108
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,480
at today

109
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,080
um in terms of bug crowd just where

110
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,599
we're up to uh

111
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,840
we we are you know a crowd sourcing

112
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,440
platform the way that i describe it to

113
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,840
folk um at this point in time i would

114
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,920
presume that a decent chunk of you

115
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,280
you've have heard at least in some

116
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,000
degree of us and others in the space who

117
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,440
subsequently join

118
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,239
um

119
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,080
you know essentially what we're doing is

120
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,840
is

121
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,519
basically connecting all the latent

122
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:56,879
potential that exists in the hakka

123
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,200
community and and plugging it into the

124
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,480
unmet demand

125
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,799
in in the cyber security space um you

126
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,720
know i do believe that uh cyber security

127
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,280
is a fundamentally human problem um the

128
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,760
technology just makes it go faster so

129
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,599
yeah with with this incredible hacker

130
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,599
community kind of you know waiting at

131
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,280
the table for an invite as they have for

132
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,839
the last 35 40 years or so um really

133
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,040
what i saw with the company was the

134
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,720
opportunity to plug plug those two

135
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,199
things in together um you know make

136
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,720
vulnerability disclosure programs

137
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,639
normalize you know enable workbending

138
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,880
programs get into crowd source security

139
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,160
in the form of pen testing different

140
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,560
things like that um and yeah a lot's

141
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,160
happened since then you know with 250

142
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,440
employees series d 80 million raised

143
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,759
about 170 000 volumes have gone through

144
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,360
the platform at this point that we've

145
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,600
that we've been a part of nuking which

146
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,759
is awesome and and so on so that's

147
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,080
some some backstory in terms of uh the

148
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,080
point of view that i'm speaking from

149
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,759
um and i do think you know corncons uh

150
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,960
we've got a

151
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,320
kind of a long history with this with

152
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,080
this conference um

153
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,600
you know we uh

154
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,240
if memory serves i think it was 24 20

155
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,039
and 14 um we actually you know sent

156
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,479
chocolate covered

157
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,639
um you know bugs literally like

158
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,639
scorpions and all sorts of other stuff

159
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,080
for the kids and some of the education

160
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,759
track there um

161
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,160
don't recommend those for for a snack

162
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,320
but it's definitely a fun novelty that

163
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,000
kind of goes along the theme of what we

164
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,720
do

165
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,039
um this slide really is is you know i

166
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,360
think some of the similarities of what

167
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,919
i've seen uh from corncon as as like a

168
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,199
core kind of cultural aspect and

169
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,039
priority of the conference and how they

170
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,039
kind of connect with a lot of what we've

171
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,880
seen um

172
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,960
you know be a lot of fun frankly and

173
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,320
quite successful with bug crowd like

174
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,479
we've had the opportunity to to educate

175
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,160
a ton of people all around the world and

176
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,680
actually give some careers into

177
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,520
information security um you know we've

178
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,520
been able to influence policy

179
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,240
in

180
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,120
the form of of having you know vdps

181
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,560
mandated across

182
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,720
um the federal government in the us

183
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,319
there's all these different things that

184
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,479
you know we get to do um

185
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,280
really as a product of of the unlikely

186
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,600
romance which is the the subject to talk

187
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,000
this idea of of hackers and and

188
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,759
companies actually

189
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,520
really needing to be able to have a

190
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,600
productive conversation and get along

191
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,520
well not really having a rich history of

192
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,759
doing that um but there's been a lot of

193
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,280
progress there and and this is some of

194
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,120
the cool stuff we've been able to do as

195
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,759
a as a byproduct of that

196
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,039
so next slide here so agenda um how we

197
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,319
got here in terms of you know where the

198
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,000
whole thing's up to a couple of war

199
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,680
stories around what we've seen

200
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,440
um practically with with you know what i

201
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,919
refer to as research driven assurance um

202
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,160
i think a lot of the time uh you know

203
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,319
historically assurance has been done or

204
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,400
approached as a checkbox exercise or

205
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,160
something that's you know mostly focused

206
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,360
on

207
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,720
on you know the output of automation

208
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,160
those sorts of things we're getting to a

209
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,440
point in time in security where that's

210
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,000
no longer acceptable as an approach uh

211
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,520
and this idea of researcher driven

212
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,280
assurance to actually dive into risk

213
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,680
i'll unpack some some of that stuff

214
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,160
um broke versus woke is really just

215
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,680
talking through i think we're at a point

216
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,720
where most folk in security have

217
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,479
some sort of notion of what a bug bounty

218
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,560
program is and and what von disclosure

219
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,960
all those different things are um you

220
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,319
know i want to kind of bring some

221
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,840
insight on on where i think they're

222
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,280
going so it's really you know how we got

223
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,960
here what's happening today and and

224
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,400
where we're going in the future

225
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,560
and we'll leave some time for q a at uh

226
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,720
at the end as well because

227
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,880
it's a fun subject and i love answering

228
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,800
questions when when people have them

229
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,960
does that sound good

230
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,800
if you can if you're in the audience

231
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,280
there um just give me a wave this is

232
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,520
yeah there you go that's very cool

233
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,199
it's it's it's funny doing the virtual

234
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,039
presentation thing it's um you know i'm

235
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,440
sitting here in in a dark room at three

236
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,720
o'clock in the morning and the

237
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,400
interaction this has definitely been

238
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,919
something to get used to with more of

239
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,520
this format but it's it's really cool to

240
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,680
be uh to be speaking to people actually

241
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,440
physically present as well so thanks for

242
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,199
thanks for coming along

243
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,039
oh let's rock and roll

244
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,840
so how we got here

245
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,280
so yeah as i mentioned

246
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,800
i've been

247
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,599
you know a computer security enthusiast

248
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,479
um you know a hacker in in in many ways

249
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,280
um

250
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,759
pretty much my entire life and

251
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,400
you know if you go back to 2012

252
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,520
um

253
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,039
you know i think it's safe to say it was

254
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,360
it was a simple time for for us in in

255
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,520
the industry we were basically

256
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,680
doing our our breaker thing we're doing

257
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,479
our curiosity and persistence thing um

258
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,240
you know we rollerbladed a lot

259
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,280
apparently

260
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,639
and and did all that kind of stuff you

261
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,960
know the um the folk that do

262
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,479
you know particularly offensive security

263
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,399
work but even deep technical defensive

264
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,279
work

265
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,799
we had our own little

266
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,159
click and our own little thing and we're

267
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,240
just kind of getting along doing that um

268
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,958
i think the downside of that was

269
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,120
you know from my experience um finding

270
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,959
it difficult to have people actually

271
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,800
take security seriously in the real

272
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,680
sense

273
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,560
um but we'll get to that in a second so

274
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,720
you know 2012 was good uh but uh also

275
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,560
you know to some degree i think rip good

276
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,440
times

277
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,399
um

278
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,399
yeah really what we saw and as i

279
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,480
mentioned before the thesis uh behind

280
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,959
starting bug crowd and you know

281
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,720
what has pretty much become my life's

282
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,120
work at this point um i think is kind of

283
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,200
summed up in this illustration right and

284
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,480
i think this is the thing that's become

285
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,720
increasingly obvious over the past over

286
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,680
the past 10 years this idea of of a tug

287
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,080
of war going on you've got you know the

288
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,160
adversary on on one side and there's

289
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,560
lots of them you've got you know

290
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,160
a diverse range of skill sets you've got

291
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,160
a diverse range of different motivations

292
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,560
you've got more of an incentive

293
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,640
for success than a constraint on the

294
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,399
number of hours a day you're being paid

295
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,800
for and so on um and then on the other

296
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,800
side you've got whoever is is tasked

297
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,519
with

298
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,519
with pulling you know

299
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,760
against them on the rope um with the

300
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,040
computer in the middle and that's that's

301
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,560
the battleground in the meantime you've

302
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,800
got you know folks from from the the

303
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,560
white hat or the you know the good faith

304
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,320
security research community

305
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,480
kind of standing right behind with their

306
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,080
hand in the air saying hey tag me in

307
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,839
like i'm here to help you know really

308
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,600
what we wanted to do was to solve that

309
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,680
um and as i said you know with with the

310
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,680
initial proof that we saw when we first

311
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,160
kicked off and i think you know a lot of

312
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,320
the work that we put in and others as

313
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,399
well put into basically

314
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,160
shifting the um

315
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,680
the mindset that people have when they

316
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,959
when they think of what a hacker

317
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,079
actually is

318
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,680
um yeah i

319
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,839
feel like there's still a lot of work

320
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,000
to be done there um because people do

321
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,600
still tend to freak out in a lot of

322
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,440
different places but we're at a point

323
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,079
now where this idea of of their being

324
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,399
you know equivalent to a locksmith in

325
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,480
the digital domain is something that

326
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,880
people broadly understand or they at

327
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,640
least acknowledge the existence of you

328
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,160
know i think prior to

329
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,839
prior to this

330
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,040
prior to a lot of what's been done over

331
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,279
the past 10 years or so we're basically

332
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,800
all burglars by default so you know how

333
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,240
do you do that how do you plug it in and

334
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,839
really why are you doing it it's because

335
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,399
math it's because of this idea that

336
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,200
um

337
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,640
you know there's not a level playing

338
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,240
field uh you know

339
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,120
as i said before like that diverse group

340
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,959
of adversaries versus

341
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,880
you know those singular constrained

342
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,839
people

343
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,839
um i see this almost as a war of

344
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,680
creativity to try to

345
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,000
try to fix the next thing

346
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,040
first

347
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,920
um

348
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,200
and ultimately it doesn't actually

349
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,399
matter how smart or or not potentially

350
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,160
uh you know the the individuals that are

351
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,640
tasked with defense are like the problem

352
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,399
is actually that the math is wrong like

353
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,560
they will eventually lose because of the

354
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,760
symmetry of of the uh of the setup so

355
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,120
that's kind of what we do in terms of

356
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,720
plugging it in

357
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,640
um so you know as i was talking about

358
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,279
you know 20 2012 like carefree times all

359
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,079
good

360
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,680
um

361
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,200
one of the experiences i had when i

362
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,519
first arrived in in san francisco was it

363
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,600
was this ride with a lift driver uh

364
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,120
where we ended up talking about security

365
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,200
because that's just what tends to happen

366
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,360
when i when i get in a car with people

367
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,160
um

368
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,839
and he trotted out this incredible quote

369
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,200
like all security is the product of

370
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,600
something bad happening which is

371
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,560
kind of

372
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,519
it's a pessimistic in some ways view

373
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,800
view of things but i actually do think

374
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,200
it captures it well um

375
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,720
you know people that build software

376
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,560
people that that make decisions that

377
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,839
impact security they're not

378
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,320
necessarily downplaying or or ignoring

379
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,519
or choosing

380
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,839
to to leave mistakes in place or to

381
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,440
create weakness right like they're

382
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,440
focused on making their thing work so

383
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,920
they actually need to have some sort of

384
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,079
some sort of event or some sort of even

385
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,040
message-driven event um basically point

386
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,160
out to them that yeah you should

387
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,360
actually lock your front door at night

388
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,240
it's a bad neighborhood um so you know

389
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,160
that's sort of summing it up and

390
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,560
as i was saying uh 2013 this was

391
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,399
actually the same month that we landed

392
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,360
in in san francisco which was pretty

393
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,639
um interesting from a timing standpoint

394
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,040
um yeah i think one of the one of the

395
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,240
really

396
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,360
major

397
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,440
side effects of the snowden disclosures

398
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,040
and people actually starting to talk

399
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,320
more openly

400
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,200
around

401
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,279
how you know cyber security and the

402
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,680
intelligence community uh

403
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,519
operate um

404
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,079
was this idea that like oh hacking is

405
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,000
actually a thing for the lay person

406
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,680
right so people that they kind of looked

407
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,160
at us all uh in our funny movies doing

408
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,639
our funny things prior to that thinking

409
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,480
oh that's kind of abstract i don't even

410
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,760
really know what that is i'm just going

411
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,600
to ignore it now all of a sudden they're

412
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,800
in a position where they're forced to

413
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,880
try to figure out how it applies to them

414
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,279
um and you know to me

415
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,320
this was a keystone moment i think in in

416
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,560
overall security awareness right

417
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,880
but then obviously it kind of escalated

418
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,079
from there so 2014 you've got target um

419
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,240
and and you know all of the the kind of

420
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,000
chip and not the chip in the uh the

421
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,240
dumps and and track two raids that

422
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,880
happened in that year so all of a sudden

423
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,120
again for the consumer hacking is

424
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,639
happening to me now right

425
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,519
fast forward a year this happens um

426
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,079
which hurt um opm was was in this year

427
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,920
as well so all of a sudden you've got

428
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,320
records and and things being stolen that

429
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,079
you that you can't ensure like if it's a

430
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,560
credit card you know it's inconvenient

431
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,279
but

432
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,560
most of the time you're gonna get that

433
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,399
money back in in these sorts of cases

434
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,880
now you're having you know breaches that

435
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,160
um

436
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,399
[Music]

437
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,560
that can't be insured and and oftentimes

438
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,079
what's taken from you you can't actually

439
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,079
retrieve so now hacking happens to me

440
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,639
and it hurts right

441
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,199
2016 you've got

442
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,839
hacking happens to my country um with

443
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,199
all the different things that happened

444
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,360
around around the election and obviously

445
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,000
that narrative continued on beyond that

446
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,519
so you can sort of see what's what's

447
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,959
going on here in terms of the general

448
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,639
population i think for us

449
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,519
in in in the security space

450
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,800
none of this

451
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,639
from my perspective came as a huge

452
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,760
surprise

453
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,199
um

454
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,600
but for everyone else outside of it like

455
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,199
what is this stuff like this is this is

456
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,839
really starting to become a uh an issue

457
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,600
that you know i don't necessarily know

458
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,959
how to understand it i'll get my arms

459
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,880
around it but i know what matters uh i

460
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,959
know it's important right

461
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,600
then 2017 to 2020 uh you know software

462
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,959
is eating the world

463
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,399
and and the bad guys are eating the

464
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,720
software again it's escalating

465
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,519
you know 2020 itself um okay now my

466
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,680
five-year like my employees

467
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,600
five-year-old is responsible for my

468
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,760
corporate attack service

469
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,720
this particular shift

470
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,040
in in how we use technology and i think

471
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,839
some of the risks that have come from it

472
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,440
i do believe that we're only just

473
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,040
starting to see

474
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,040
how that plays out from from a risk

475
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,560
management and even from a threat

476
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,480
modelling standpoint um you know one of

477
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,839
the things that uh

478
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,320
that we observed um early in the

479
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,560
pandemic was the fact that

480
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,720
um you know basically

481
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,759
zero day in in uh consumer products um

482
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,759
like iot you know

483
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,680
soho routers those those sorts of things

484
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,279
that stuff's been around forever but no

485
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,720
one bought it because it wasn't super

486
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,199
interesting on the offensive side um you

487
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,160
know come april you know may of 2020

488
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,399
that stuff starts to starts to fly off

489
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,680
the shelf so

490
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,440
you've got the adversary thinking

491
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,399
through

492
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,920
how this shift in in your behavior um

493
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,920
creates new opportunity for them and

494
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,199
that's that's obviously something that

495
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,720
rolls down to us

496
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,680
and this is meant to be 2021 but um

497
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,839
you'll get it um you know it's the year

498
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,199
of the xyz

499
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:15,810
like looking

500
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,199
[Music]

501
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,440
definitely from from a a supply chain

502
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,279
standpoint again not a huge shock to

503
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,519
people in security we know that's been

504
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,279
a risk and and you know somewhat of a

505
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,120
trash fire in different ways for a long

506
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,040
time but all of a sudden you've got all

507
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,120
these points of proof popping up to to

508
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,800
basically impact

509
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,320
you know folks that are on on the

510
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,160
receiving end as victims of the use of

511
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,519
this type of thing when it's when it's

512
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,639
done you know maliciously um

513
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,079
and people start talking about it and

514
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,800
all of a sudden it becomes a focus right

515
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,839
so

516
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,440
the thing with this is if it's repeated

517
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,440
enough at the dinner table it ends up in

518
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,399
in the boardroom um yeah this idea

519
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,600
that's

520
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,120
that's um

521
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,040
you know the spouse or the children or

522
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,839
the family of executives and and board

523
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,199
members um actually elevate you know the

524
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,559
the the awareness and the thinking

525
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,240
around security is an issue of risk

526
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,079
management for an organization

527
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,839
like i do believe that that's been a

528
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,280
fundamental driver of of you know us all

529
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,359
now being

530
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,079
very busy um and probably having you

531
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,400
know a pretty good feeling from from a

532
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,400
job security standpoint because it's

533
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,559
just dinner table conversation now and

534
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,880
that hasn't always been true

535
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,000
yeah i think

536
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,559
um going back to the because math thing

537
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,000
uh you know we had the uh the cso of

538
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,840
national australia bank um here in

539
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,720
australia actually join us as our cso at

540
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,919
bug crowd

541
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:40,880
um

542
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,880
what was that about six months ago now

543
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,880
maybe a little bit more than that

544
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,679
um

545
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,840
for this reason he's he's looking at it

546
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,360
through the lens of someone who's done

547
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,280
risk management who's done offensive

548
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,520
security defensive security like feed

549
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,840
out ir you know protect detect respond

550
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,760
all those different things in a banking

551
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,240
context which is you know amongst the

552
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,120
most

553
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,840
i would say mature

554
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,960
thinkers

555
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,200
in terms of cyber risk management

556
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,160
and

557
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,760
he kind of came to this this conclusion

558
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,880
that i was talking about before like

559
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,600
diversity is is key like the the idea of

560
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,520
being able to broaden out

561
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,799
your talent pool and where you're able

562
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,400
to get answers from is actually a

563
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,000
critical and overlooked factor in in

564
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,799
security and control strategies um so

565
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,120
he's he's joined it's been fantastic

566
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,120
to have to have him involved like to me

567
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,480
this is sort of evidence of what i was

568
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,400
just saying about you know these issues

569
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,640
these pressures and this idea of like no

570
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,240
we need to be able to figure out how to

571
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,480
have dogs and cats play nice together in

572
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,440
the form of hackers and organizations

573
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,280
like if we can do that then we've got a

574
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,880
chance of actually you know maintaining

575
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,080
a level playing field as we go forward

576
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,799
so there is again biggest math right

577
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,840
um

578
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,760
so that's my setup in terms of you know

579
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,960
how i feel the the back story has kind

580
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,960
of driven us to this point my camera

581
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,880
will come back in a sec i still have to

582
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,160
figure out how to stop it from doing

583
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,039
that

584
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,080
um

585
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,919
yeah something something to to talk

586
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,880
about and this is kind of getting into

587
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,720
um a bit of a a geekier end of the the

588
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,039
talk and some of the war stories uh that

589
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,120
we've seen where this idea of researcher

590
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,799
driven assurance or research driven

591
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,520
assurance um yeah what does that look

592
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,280
like in practice

593
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,840
um so struts two uh aka the the equifax

594
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,400
vulnerability it's the the one that was

595
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,640
used in in you know the fairly high

596
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,400
profile attack there

597
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,679
um

598
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,160
we actually saw that getting

599
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,720
basically put through the platform prior

600
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,520
to

601
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,919
you know the the public dropping of a

602
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,600
proof of concept

603
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,080
and what we also saw was organizations

604
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,000
that we worked with you know being

605
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,240
notified of where that existed in ways

606
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,320
that had fallen outside of their their

607
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,200
normal

608
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,880
you know patch and asset management

609
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,919
program

610
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,520
in a way that allowed them to get it

611
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,159
fixed and this was four months before

612
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,400
the actual breach uh took place on

613
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,559
equifax so this idea of that that

614
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,480
curiosity the diversity of skill being

615
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,840
applied to it all the different things

616
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,760
that are going and actually approaching

617
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,159
assurance from a research driven

618
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,760
lens um you know closed a window of

619
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,000
exploitability within that vertical for

620
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,840
this particular organization by by four

621
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,400
months which is a pretty cool win

622
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,679
um

623
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,960
yeah the the confluence issue um i've

624
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,039
i've dubbed this one conflue

625
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,880
which hasn't caught on yet maybe it's

626
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,120
too soon to be joking about that but you

627
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,000
know

628
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,159
whatever i'd love if that would if that

629
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,679
could catch on because it just seems

630
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,559
like a great name for the bug but

631
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,480
that aside um what we saw happen with

632
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,559
that one is the patch dropped on

633
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,080
on the 25th

634
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,400
um basically end day reversing on that

635
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,720
patch started immediately

636
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,520
um

637
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,799
we saw

638
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,080
artifacts of active exploitation within

639
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,880
a day or two and then the public exploit

640
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,799
dropped and and everyone kind of went

641
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,960
went ham at that point so this idea

642
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,679
again of of this you know research

643
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:10,880
driven

644
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,880
kind of tenacity being applied uh to

645
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,280
things that impacts the internet at web

646
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,440
scale um that's an example of where

647
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,200
we've seen that all these by the way

648
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,520
i'll put these slides up after the talk

649
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,520
i've got a bunch of links in here for

650
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,280
for any any you know homework or

651
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,120
follow-up you'll want to do so there's

652
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,640
some stuff attached to each of these

653
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,720
so another one f5 to muay

654
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,280
again same story you know there was the

655
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,640
introduction of a vulnerability there

656
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,520
was

657
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,679
you know arguably private availability

658
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,360
of the exploit and exploitation

659
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,520
potentially from offensive actors

660
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,280
um there's a fair bit of evidence around

661
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,720
to suggest that that was actually taking

662
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,760
place before uh the exploit itself got

663
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,400
commoditized and and you know nation

664
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,840
states actually started using it to

665
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,559
pretty much hose down the internet

666
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,360
we saw again the vulnerability coming

667
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,240
through

668
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,440
prior to

669
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,960
the dropping of the public exploit and

670
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,120
that that commoditization taking place

671
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,799
like for those of you who've heard of hd

672
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,559
moore's law um the idea of basically the

673
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,960
the sophistication and the size of your

674
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,720
attacker pool is proportional to the

675
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,559
availability of the exploit which makes

676
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,960
sense when you think about it right um

677
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,960
this was very much an example of that

678
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,080
story

679
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,480
and and again we were seeing that

680
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,600
um

681
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,440
basically used uh to to identify risk in

682
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,679
organizations with an incentive attached

683
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:32,960
to it in context of a bug boundary

684
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,360
program so that risk could be eliminated

685
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,679
you know prior to the the the wider

686
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,360
scale stuff kicking off

687
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,320
um this is an interesting one from from

688
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,679
a um

689
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,360
less of a

690
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,840
a vulnerability uh

691
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,080
in and of itself like a discrete you

692
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,679
know cve

693
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,760
type of type of issue and more of a new

694
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,039
attack class so type confusion

695
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,480
um

696
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,720
is effectively a supply chain um exploit

697
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,080
in terms of some of the assumptions that

698
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,640
can get built in to where

699
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,480
where supply chains of the software

700
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,640
supply chains are pulling packages and

701
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,840
code from

702
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,480
um you know what we saw with this one uh

703
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,679
prior to

704
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,280
a paper that got written i think it was

705
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,440
in january or february of this year we'd

706
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,600
actually seen that same

707
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,200
attack path

708
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,520
um exploited in the wild for probably

709
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,600
six to nine months beforehand it all

710
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,039
kind of got tied together around i

711
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,640
believe was node.js

712
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,400
um but then all of a sudden you know

713
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,840
people are looking for those those same

714
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,480
sorts of issues in in ruby gems and and

715
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,320
all the other kind of foss you know

716
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,279
package

717
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,120
ecosystems where this type of problem

718
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,320
might exist

719
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,279
so yeah again you've got this like real

720
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,000
focus on not just using the things that

721
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,600
we know

722
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,520
uh from an attack technique and from a

723
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,080
from an assurance standpoint today but

724
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,760
actually thinking about what's next it's

725
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,440
this diversity of

726
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,919
of knowledge and then you know frankly

727
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,880
the um the incentive and the curiosity

728
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,480
that exists within the white hat

729
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,559
community actually connecting

730
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,440
with companies um in a way that makes

731
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,520
them makes them more secure and that's

732
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,480
you know when i'm talking about the

733
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,960
unlikely romance that's that's kind of

734
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,760
an example of that this idea of

735
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,679
wow i didn't think they'd get on so well

736
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,919
but here we are um

737
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,320
pretty cool one

738
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,799
[Music]

739
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,960
uh another that was

740
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,159
really fun this was actually in a um

741
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,760
fortune

742
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,760
20 company

743
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,440
they had they had a

744
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,520
basically a front door website

745
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,400
um

746
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,880
that as you could imagine has been

747
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,200
absolutely pummeled by

748
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,039
by adversaries but also by you know pen

749
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,640
testers scanners like all sorts of

750
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,559
different things for for for a really

751
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,799
long period of time um what we saw a

752
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,960
researcher do uh with with that was

753
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,120
basically

754
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,799
you know put a fair bit of work in this

755
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,640
this was actually a difficult exercise

756
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,720
xxe to find and this was actually fairly

757
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,520
early i think in people's awareness of

758
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,080
injection as a as a you know exploit

759
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,039
path

760
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,200
but they created a code path they got

761
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,760
through and and were you know able to be

762
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,440
in a position where they could have a

763
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,320
code path that allowed them to to

764
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,960
basically execute xse off the back of

765
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,600
that they were able to drop off inside

766
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,880
the the core basically web server farm

767
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,640
so not just this particular site itself

768
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,919
but all of its adjacent systems so on at

769
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,760
that point you know they uh they

770
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,200
basically waved the white flag and said

771
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,440
i don't think i should go any further um

772
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,520
we looked at it the the client did as

773
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,919
well and agreed with that but yeah to me

774
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,279
that one is is fascinating because

775
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,360
these systems have been looked at

776
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,279
um pretty intensely for a really long

777
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,600
time and this was basically

778
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,640
you know joe internet to god mode

779
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,320
as a vulnerability that existed on that

780
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,159
system so you know the fact that those

781
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,000
things still do fall out when you apply

782
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,640
this kind of firepower i think is is

783
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,760
quite um quite compelling

784
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,520
and probably the last one and this is

785
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,760
definitely a um

786
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,400
an unlikely romance uh in a lot of ways

787
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,320
um you know one of the one of the bits

788
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,080
of pushback one of the assumptions that

789
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,840
i think a lot of people have around you

790
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,240
know security researchers hackers like

791
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,960
bug bounty or crowdsourcing um

792
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,600
is that you know you've got to be

793
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,520
a fairly fast and loose

794
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,159
organization from a risk you know

795
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,400
acceptance standpoint to engage this

796
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,080
type of model like we've been working

797
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,919
with the department of defense

798
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,840
for seven years now um just uh just did

799
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,760
a like launched a partnership with with

800
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,159
cisa around um you know vulnerability

801
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,240
disclosure programs for all federal

802
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,159
civilian agencies these these are

803
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,440
conservative like traditionally

804
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,559
conservative groups that are recognizing

805
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,440
again that they need this help they've

806
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,360
got plenty of smart people it's not a

807
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,440
dis on you know pen testers or red

808
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,880
teamers of their employees they just

809
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,360
know they need more because of the size

810
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,440
and the veracity the the adversary that

811
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,760
they ultimately have to outsmart so

812
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,880
this was a um a private

813
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,279
private crowdsource pen test that we did

814
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,360
on a cloud computing environment for the

815
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,000
for the us air force um

816
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,679
you know pretty much all of their

817
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,480
workloads go up to this thing so there

818
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,000
was nothing in it obviously when we were

819
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,679
testing it because of the comp up

820
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,600
analyzation side of things

821
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,360
um

822
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,640
but they're pretty good at building

823
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,039
things securely so we weren't expecting

824
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,039
to to you know completely hose the thing

825
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:35,919
down

826
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,440
we went through it pretty much with a

827
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,039
fine-tooth comb so like source code

828
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,120
analysis you know the the us air force

829
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,080
actually releasing source code out to

830
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,720
you know the the dirty population um

831
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,240
there's tons of vetting all these

832
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,640
different things to go in to this type

833
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,799
of program on our side but it's still i

834
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:53,520
think

835
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,159
logically a bit of a a mental leap

836
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,039
um for those guys to take to even adopt

837
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,640
that model in the first place this this

838
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,120
one was very cool um social engineering

839
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,799
crowdsourcing that that

840
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,120
that was experimental and and they they

841
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,799
actually flagged it we said yeah let's

842
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,039
let's find ways to do that and give it a

843
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:11,760
shot

844
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,200
um

845
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,799
really interesting and was incredibly

846
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,240
effective because again you've got this

847
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,640
diversity of thought it's not just one

848
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,039
person's way of of trying to social

849
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,880
engineer it's it's like a lot of people

850
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,120
and you know you have collaboration kick

851
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,159
in and different things like that that

852
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,679
was actually quite effective which is

853
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,480
pretty cool uh you know 54 volumes 123

854
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,480
grand paid the top reward there was was

855
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,480
20 000 which was

856
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,840
a pretty fun uh gig

857
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,080
um you know and for those who are in the

858
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,120
audience either in the room or online

859
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,960
who

860
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,840
you know are thinking about this from

861
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,679
the researcher angle

862
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:50,880
uh

863
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,640
yeah i honestly i think this kind of

864
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,799
content what this is is a list of a list

865
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,039
of content creators and places where you

866
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,799
can you can get

867
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,880
you know educational content that's

868
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,360
talking about all the different areas of

869
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,520
research that you know you could be you

870
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,240
could be thinking about that are i think

871
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,440
most

872
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,520
relevant right now to the to the

873
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,200
industry in particular

874
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,559
um

875
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,880
but also you know what's coming down the

876
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,640
pike like what are the different things

877
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,159
that are cutting edge like the um the

878
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,320
type confusion issue that i was talking

879
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,840
about before it's like these are the

880
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,159
kind of forums where those things pop up

881
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,480
um you know buck grade university is our

882
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,799
effort to do that um actually everyone

883
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,279
who's on this list uh actually works for

884
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,360
bug crowd or has worked for buckrad in

885
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,200
the past so that's kind of going back to

886
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,559
what i was saying about education being

887
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,159
something that's quite important to us

888
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,080
but yeah as i said before i'll put these

889
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,360
slides up online if you want to check

890
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,000
those links out later on i do recommend

891
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,200
them for

892
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,720
for folks that aren't necessarily

893
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,559
thinking about this in terms of becoming

894
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,320
a hunter or becoming a pentester or

895
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,080
doing security research as a career as

896
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,440
well um

897
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,360
we often see

898
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,120
you know csos

899
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,600
and and you know folks on the

900
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,760
the governance and management side who

901
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,640
have

902
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,880
either a technical background or like a

903
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,440
really strong technical inclination um

904
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,679
absolutely loving this this type of

905
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,120
stuff because it gives them an idea of

906
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,120
what's going on like how how other

907
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,440
people are thinking about it so

908
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,480
yes all right so broke versus why let's

909
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,399
get into this part and then we'll throw

910
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,080
a q a

911
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,760
i'm actually just going to have a

912
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,120
quick sip of water here real quick

913
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,600
you guys probably heard the coffee kick

914
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,960
in about halfway through that last

915
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,440
section it's like okay let's go

916
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,120
so i'm slowing myself down so it all

917
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,200
comes out clear all right

918
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,520
so broke versus woke um

919
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,200
yeah

920
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,120
as i mentioned before we're at a point

921
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,679
now where

922
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,919
if you if you say even the phrase bug

923
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,720
bounty to someone um

924
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,320
in in you know definitely in the

925
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,159
security space and oftentimes in the

926
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,000
technology space as well

927
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,760
they're almost immediately going to have

928
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,720
some sort of opinion um and a lot of the

929
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,480
time that's really good um you know what

930
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,480
i what i have seen is that

931
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,320
there's so much more

932
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,559
texture and and

933
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,159
kind of nuance in the ways that you can

934
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,080
deploy this model it's not just one size

935
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,320
fits all which is the part that i think

936
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,200
a lot of people miss like bug crowd

937
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,799
i didn't start the company and i you

938
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,399
know frankly didn't start the category

939
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,399
just to do bug bounty um in in the way

940
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,720
that you know facebook and google uh do

941
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,240
it right like that's that's one

942
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,159
variation that's definitely a way to do

943
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,600
it if you're that kind of company you've

944
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,120
got that kind of resource and approach

945
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,880
to security it's appropriate it's

946
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,320
probably not a fit for a lot of other

947
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,200
people

948
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,080
um

949
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,080
you know as i mentioned before we do a

950
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,080
lot around you know vulnerability

951
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,519
disclosure programs which i believe is

952
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,279
something everyone should have uh but

953
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,200
then things like you know crowdsource

954
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,600
pen testing and and researcher matching

955
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,720
to do you know work on cars and

956
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,760
and different things like that so

957
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,159
there's quite this sort of spectrum of

958
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,840
ways to get it done so

959
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,840
this is you know me going through some

960
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,919
of the things that i see as assumptions

961
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,039
um

962
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,799
and uh you know trying to trying to give

963
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,120
my view of better ways to approach them

964
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,279
going forward

965
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,440
and this is a this first one's a kind of

966
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,000
an overall cyber security thing um you

967
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,600
know rub some blockchain or automation

968
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,760
or ml on it and it'll go away as a

969
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,039
problem right

970
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,320
um

971
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,440
yeah i think technology is incredible as

972
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,120
a leather you know the metaphor i often

973
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,039
use is the iron man suit

974
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,000
um

975
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,679
you know the suit without

976
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,080
the human is is dumb

977
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,840
uh you know the human without the suit

978
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,320
is is weak if you can put them together

979
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,000
then all of a sudden you've got you've

980
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,760
got something pretty cool happening uh

981
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,919
but the idea of

982
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,279
you know installing a blinky box and

983
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,120
making your problem stop at that point i

984
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,000
think

985
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,320
um yeah people still buy it people still

986
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,320
believe it i think it's fundamentally

987
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,720
inaccurate because as i said before

988
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,960
cyber security is a human problem

989
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,279
you know the technology just amplifies

990
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,640
and accelerates

991
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,039
the the anti patterns and the decisions

992
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,200
that we that we put into it so you know

993
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,120
you can't just solve it with tech from

994
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,880
my perspective you know

995
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,559
and and really that's kind of i believe

996
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,399
the uh the the kind of woke

997
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,360
interpretation of of that particular um

998
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,120
thesis that people have no it's not just

999
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,720
about the tech like you got to think

1000
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,640
about it in terms of

1001
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,559
you know the creativity the uniqueness

1002
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,240
of your organization what the sign

1003
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,799
decisions what your risk and economic

1004
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,399
factors play into creating risk um and

1005
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,720
then work out if technology can give you

1006
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,039
leverage around you know what you do

1007
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,320
with that information from a risk

1008
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,080
management standpoint so yeah cyber

1009
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,679
security's a people problem detectives

1010
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,080
makes it go faster

1011
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,399
um broke uh vulnerability disclosure

1012
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,480
programs as a marketing stunt uh we saw

1013
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,880
this a lot in the early days um

1014
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,480
you know people and it still is the

1015
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,799
thing that happens today um you know

1016
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,559
less frequently but it's still very much

1017
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,480
a thing people going out and launching a

1018
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,919
program

1019
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,799
mostly for the sake of of getting into

1020
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,880
inter tech crunch or or you know

1021
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,679
sometimes even in response to um

1022
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,679
security research that's gone bad or a

1023
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,679
breach or something along those lines i

1024
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,679
do think you know for public

1025
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,839
vulnerability disclosure programs and

1026
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,480
bug benny programs the marketing aspect

1027
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,399
of it um

1028
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,399
is a pretty powerful thing like the idea

1029
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,159
of being able to describe

1030
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,320
you know what you're doing to to make a

1031
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,320
user safer is like neighborhood watch

1032
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,480
for the internet like the layperson can

1033
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,520
actually get their head around that

1034
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,639
which is

1035
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,480
which is pretty cool but that can't be

1036
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,079
the only reason you're doing it i think

1037
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,918
you've got to actually be thinking about

1038
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:38,879
how to

1039
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,239
how to get smarter off the back of this

1040
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,280
stuff like not just finding

1041
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,800
vulnerabilities but actually creating

1042
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,719
feedback loops between the builders in

1043
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,960
your organization and breakers who can

1044
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,119
who can think differently um again back

1045
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,599
to the unlikely romance right the more

1046
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,239
that's a feedback loop and a transaction

1047
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,320
of thinking i think the uh the more

1048
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,560
powerful it becomes so you know woke is

1049
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,240
is you know basically vdp showing to the

1050
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,640
organization but to to to the to the

1051
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,400
market as well that like failure is a

1052
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,720
part of being human um

1053
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,280
no no one's perfect i i do think

1054
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,599
actually launching one of these programs

1055
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,680
is an antidote to what i call like

1056
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,920
ostrich risk management where you know

1057
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,920
people just kind of bury their head in

1058
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,000
the sand and assume that if they ignore

1059
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,760
uh vulnerabilities then they won't

1060
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,160
matter like that's being increasingly

1061
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,440
shown as not a good strategy and this

1062
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,720
actually short circuits that pretty

1063
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,960
quickly

1064
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,200
all right bro bug ban is a silver bullet

1065
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,040
woke bug bounty is a way for the

1066
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,480
business to internalize the idea that

1067
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,079
the boogeyman's real

1068
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,520
um

1069
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,359
this is a really powerful one from a

1070
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:44,880
security awareness and education

1071
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,720
standpoint i think

1072
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,800
the the thing that we've observed

1073
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,240
consistently

1074
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,839
is that the uh

1075
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,119
you know

1076
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,920
the the call it the psychological impact

1077
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,800
um

1078
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,640
i don't mean that in like a overly

1079
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,640
strong way it's like how it how it

1080
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,560
changes the way you think about

1081
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,000
everything not just

1082
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,839
the information it gives you

1083
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,400
um that impact on an engineer

1084
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,320
when they see their kid

1085
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,119
their code you know get owned by some

1086
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,200
kid halfway across the world

1087
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,520
is is very different to when they get an

1088
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,640
alert from a scanner or you know um get

1089
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,119
a report from from a pen tester in-house

1090
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,000
because

1091
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,320
what it does is it begs the question you

1092
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,520
know that person who submitted the

1093
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,839
report like they're friendly and i i

1094
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,359
trust them and this all seems to be

1095
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,119
working out great but i wonder what

1096
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,880
their next door neighbor's like and i

1097
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,520
wonder you know who all else

1098
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,440
is in that neighborhood oh my gosh like

1099
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,359
this can actually happen this is real

1100
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,760
you know the idea of exploitation being

1101
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,440
possible if you introduce a

1102
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,440
vulnerability like it's gone from being

1103
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,520
this abstract idea to something that you

1104
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,000
just saw happen literally so i think

1105
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,760
that's actually

1106
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,839
you know that's that's a really powerful

1107
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,920
phenomena um

1108
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,920
you know you're never more security

1109
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,200
conscious than just after you've been

1110
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,200
breached as an organization i think this

1111
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,920
is a way to achieve some of those

1112
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,839
upsides without obviously the mess and

1113
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:11,279
the fast of an actual breach

1114
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,839
uh broke literally uh total payouts is a

1115
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,079
vanity metric um

1116
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,320
this is a valid strategy for for

1117
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,119
companies that that can afford it i do

1118
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,599
think you know the list of those

1119
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,599
companies that can actually you know for

1120
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,119
starters pay

1121
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,000
um

1122
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,440
you know multiple millions of dollars

1123
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,560
per year

1124
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,599
um

1125
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,079
and and you know

1126
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,040
seconds who actually should do that uh

1127
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,720
as a part of their overall strategy i

1128
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,280
think that's quite a small list um

1129
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,000
and it does kind of get touted i i see a

1130
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,560
lot as like the pinnacle of doing it

1131
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,400
right if you if you're paying out a ton

1132
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,839
of money you know all that kind of stuff

1133
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,839
then then obviously this is a successful

1134
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,680
bug branding program like i love making

1135
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,160
sure that researchers are getting paid

1136
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:56,960
um

1137
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,240
you know hackers are getting paid

1138
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,320
they're able to actually turn this into

1139
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,400
more of a job frankly on on their side

1140
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,960
but if as a as a company running one of

1141
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,119
these programs you feel that like the

1142
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,520
more you pay out the better you're doing

1143
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,960
it doesn't really

1144
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,200
say good things about your overall

1145
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,280
security management strategy within the

1146
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,800
organization it's like are you fixing

1147
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,079
these issues like are you actually

1148
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,760
getting better at not introducing them

1149
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,960
in the first place

1150
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,839
um

1151
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,760
from my perspective the work version is

1152
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,119
is really the repo

1153
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,720
required payment

1154
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,680
uh

1155
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,560
to to create an impact um you know

1156
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,320
taking that and actually using it as a

1157
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,680
business metric

1158
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,839
for the cost to attack the organization

1159
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,280
overall so

1160
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,200
yeah if you think about it in terms of

1161
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,960
like a fireproof safe

1162
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,920
um

1163
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,599
if you yield a fireproof safe into the

1164
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,280
sun it's going to burn so it's not

1165
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,599
fireproof it's fire resistant and what

1166
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,520
you see is that this thing's going to

1167
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,839
protect your passport for seven hours at

1168
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,160
1400 degrees fahrenheit or whatever that

1169
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,440
might be

1170
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,359
you can get those kind of metrics out of

1171
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:00,720
out of uh

1172
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,440
you know bounty driven payments um if

1173
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,760
you're you know at ten thousand dollars

1174
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,280
and all of a sudden you've not seen a

1175
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,119
critical issue come through in in the

1176
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,119
last 90 days like congratulations you

1177
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,400
graduated

1178
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,240
you put it up a little bit you'll see

1179
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,520
more because at that point you've

1180
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,359
increased the heat right like folk are

1181
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,040
looking more intently you're probably

1182
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,960
going to activate people that weren't

1183
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,280
as compelled by ten thousand dollars as

1184
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,440
they might be by 15. all those different

1185
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,480
things and you just end up with you know

1186
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,160
this progressively

1187
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,640
increasing amount

1188
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,839
that

1189
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,680
really reflects what you've done to

1190
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,160
increase the cost to attack the business

1191
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,000
for for an adversary

1192
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,680
and you know from my perspective that's

1193
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,520
one of the easiest ways to explain what

1194
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,800
we do

1195
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,599
like across the board to to uh you know

1196
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,200
a board of directors or to someone who's

1197
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,599
not from our space um the fact that

1198
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,040
there's a dollar sign in there helps

1199
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,480
because people just

1200
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,920
you know pay more attention to that to

1201
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,520
the number like compared to the number

1202
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,920
of alerts you've seen or the number of

1203
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,839
vulnerabilities you've fixed so i think

1204
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:05,839
that one's a a pretty pretty hot tip

1205
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,079
um bro pentester is an assurance only

1206
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,680
model work

1207
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,160
assurance and impact together to create

1208
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,440
build-a-breaker feedback loops i've

1209
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,240
already

1210
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,079
gone over this quite a bit in in the

1211
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,680
last section so i won't label this one

1212
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,000
too much but you know graduating like

1213
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,800
graduating from this idea of security

1214
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,560
testing just being about

1215
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,480
checking checking the box and making

1216
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,119
sure that you followed a methodology

1217
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,560
yeah the challenge i've always had with

1218
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,400
that as a practitioner and something

1219
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,400
that i've seen is be able to do

1220
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,680
um

1221
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,400
or

1222
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,960
shift frankly in in context of research

1223
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,960
driven assurance is that proving a

1224
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,560
negative is kind of impossible like the

1225
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,079
fact that you've looked

1226
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,680
doesn't mean there isn't

1227
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,560
something there um like we know this in

1228
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,640
the space i think folks outside the

1229
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,680
space can get a little confused by it

1230
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,079
i do think that if if you kind of you

1231
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,079
know set the bar around assurance

1232
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,920
activities

1233
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,280
and basically render them as though

1234
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,839
you've proven a negative what you're

1235
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,280
ultimately doing is missing a whole

1236
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,359
bunch of stuff so this idea of tying

1237
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,920
that with with actually going after

1238
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,160
after impacts in a in a more i think

1239
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,800
focused and aggressive way um is is a

1240
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,079
pretty good way to get the best of both

1241
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,720
worlds um your bug crowds next

1242
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,200
generation pen test product um actually

1243
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,440
does that so what we'll do is we run

1244
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,200
people that are going through very

1245
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,520
methodically

1246
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,040
yeah effectively

1247
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,440
incentivized to complete tasks

1248
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,960
but then what they've got next to them

1249
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,400
is a whole bunch of people that are

1250
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,520
incentivized to create impacts in a more

1251
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,680
traditional uh bug vantage reward model

1252
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,520
so you can you know

1253
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,599
assemble things together and actually

1254
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,920
get some you know better frankly risk

1255
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,440
management data

1256
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,280
from from that whole

1257
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,440
exercise

1258
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,839
um this is a new one broke uh

1259
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:55,760
nation state wouldn't bother with my

1260
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,200
stuff um

1261
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,040
yeah i think there's this there's been a

1262
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,359
period in in cyber security where we

1263
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,440
really over rotated on the whole apt

1264
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,400
thing it used to drive me nuts it's like

1265
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,560
oh you want to keep

1266
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,319
you know this bear or that panda or

1267
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,760
whatever else out of your network that's

1268
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,040
the most important thing and this is

1269
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,839
exactly what they're doing and in the

1270
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:16,880
meantime you've got you know single

1271
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,960
factor authentication no one's rotating

1272
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,640
passwords you're not patching anything

1273
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,800
whatever else um so i do think for a

1274
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,480
period it was

1275
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,400
really an issue of like no you need to

1276
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,960
actually learn basic hygiene before you

1277
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,680
go off and try to solve you know cancer

1278
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,880
um as a metaphor there um i do think

1279
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,520
that's changed like solarwinds

1280
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,920
you know there was

1281
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,400
in terms of what got reported out a

1282
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,960
limited number of agencies and targets

1283
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,119
that had active exfiltration and active

1284
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,160
use of the shells that that's um ended

1285
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,640
up all over the place but the reality is

1286
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,560
that a lot of people got popped in that

1287
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,119
particular attack um you know half diem

1288
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,920
with with the exchange stuff there's all

1289
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,160
these different examples where

1290
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,240
you know it does feel to me very much

1291
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,920
like nation states in general are taking

1292
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,960
the gloves off quite a bit um and going

1293
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,079
out and getting whatever they can um

1294
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:13,040
really

1295
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,960
just in case they want to use it later

1296
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,040
uh there's a there's an overall trend

1297
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,160
that i'm seeing from an attacker's

1298
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,960
standpoint sisa and nsa going out and

1299
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,720
doing advisories on this type of things

1300
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,960
i'm not not on my own in having this

1301
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,880
opinion um

1302
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,240
yeah really what it comes down to is

1303
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,680
that you know the woke version of that

1304
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,079
the the kind of his how we probably have

1305
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,160
to think of it next is you know how am i

1306
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,760
going to detect and contain a nation

1307
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,400
state assuming they're successful so

1308
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,920
thinking about your your defensive

1309
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,000
program is building it like it's broken

1310
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
you know how do you do

1311
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,800
like blast radius management um you know

1312
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,480
compartmentalization uh you know

1313
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,200
detection in in context of that um yeah

1314
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,119
i think deception technology and honey

1315
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,200
that's as an entrepreneur one of my

1316
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,079
favorite

1317
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,480
things um in terms of how it fits into

1318
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,000
this i do see that

1319
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,760
playing a bigger role in the future but

1320
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,599
in general this idea of okay i'm gonna

1321
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,960
end up dealing

1322
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,359
with with you know folks that are very

1323
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:09,359
well resourced

1324
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,440
and i just you know need to need to be

1325
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,640
considering that and in how i do my um

1326
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,440
do my do my math as a as a defender

1327
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,200
um you know the the actually the

1328
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,880
ransomware gangs are in a similar bucket

1329
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,480
too now so some of the stuff that we're

1330
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,640
seeing out of cyber criminals who've

1331
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,839
traditionally been a lot less

1332
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:27,920
sophisticated than what they'd use

1333
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,040
um

1334
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,359
ransomware's working so

1335
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,640
what that means is they end up with a

1336
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,119
bunch of money that they can use to hire

1337
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,040
really clever people to

1338
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,960
procure capability that makes their next

1339
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,880
attack more effective and that's just

1340
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,680
continuing to escalate so the cassia

1341
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,760
attacks were i think a pretty good

1342
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,839
example of that that was

1343
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:49,440
some fairly

1344
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,720
high end

1345
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,480
you know kill train construction they

1346
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,000
did to get that done

1347
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,240
uh that's not necessarily that typical

1348
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,240
of of that type of group so you know

1349
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,760
looking at that is something that we we

1350
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,200
continue to see it's sort of in the same

1351
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,359
bucket

1352
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:06,160
um last one so so broke this is this is

1353
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,520
one for the you know the folks that have

1354
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,440
done their own vulnerability research in

1355
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,119
in the crowd you will have definitely

1356
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,040
experienced this you know security at

1357
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,839
domain.com uh routing to devnull

1358
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,440
um

1359
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,800
it's a thing yeah i i think as as the

1360
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,880
unlikely romance as this relationship

1361
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,480
between hackers and companies becomes

1362
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,760
more normal

1363
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,920
um what you see as a byproduct of that

1364
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,920
is more people reaching out and and

1365
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,520
trying to help

1366
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,200
and half the time

1367
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,119
getting crickets in response because you

1368
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:37,040
know folk just haven't been proactive

1369
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,520
about setting that stuff up yet

1370
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,520
this is where discloso comes in you know

1371
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,079
bug crowd as an organization helps

1372
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,640
companies manage these these types of

1373
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,640
programs um

1374
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,240
we got together with a whole bunch of

1375
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,599
well i got together with a whole bunch

1376
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:52,880
of other folks that have been working on

1377
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,240
this issue of of basically standardizing

1378
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,440
policy um making it easier to

1379
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,599
implement and to actually read and

1380
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,200
understand

1381
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,200
for the sake of adoption like how do we

1382
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,920
just make this as bone dead simple as we

1383
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,960
can

1384
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,560
for as many people to do as possible and

1385
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,000
just make it normal across the internet

1386
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:12,880
i do

1387
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,119
fundamentally believe that some

1388
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:16,960
you know security research and this this

1389
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,319
relationship between hackers and

1390
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:20,560
companies is going to be a pretty vital

1391
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,440
part of how we stay safe in into the

1392
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,800
future

1393
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,880
and do think of them as like the

1394
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,880
internet's immune system uh you know in

1395
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,480
some ways we've got a bit of an immune

1396
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,079
deficiency historically that we're

1397
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:33,680
trying to trying to recover from and

1398
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,040
that's really a lot of what the

1399
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,960
disclosure project's about

1400
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,400
so

1401
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,760
a bunch of different things you can

1402
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,680
check out

1403
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,040
essentially you know policymaker is is

1404
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,720
helping people actually it generates

1405
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,520
policies uh um it's got a standard

1406
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,040
uh that's being translated into

1407
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,040
different languages now which is cool

1408
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,839
but what it also does is spits out a

1409
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:57,599
record which lets people know where your

1410
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:00,000
policy can be found and and where you

1411
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,240
want to receive vulnerability reports um

1412
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,800
dns security txt is a

1413
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,520
is a new proposed standard that came out

1414
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,520
of a bunch of the folk that um help out

1415
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,520
with with disclosure it's an open source

1416
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,800
not-for-profit

1417
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,560
project uh by the way so if you're

1418
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,760
interested in

1419
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:16,720
you know

1420
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,560
helping out or being a part of it

1421
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,839
through that lens

1422
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:21,599
uh we'd love that

1423
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,000
um so there's that hacker connect is is

1424
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,079
really about um

1425
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:27,520
you know solving this question of i've

1426
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,000
found a vulnerability like who do i tell

1427
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,280
um i think there's been a couple of

1428
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,119
other talks in in the conference so sick

1429
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,520
codes earlier on um is definitely

1430
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,040
someone who actually helps out with this

1431
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,800
stuff a lot but has used it as well to

1432
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,400
get information into the right hands

1433
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,839
it's a hard problem to solve you know

1434
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:43,920
what tends to happen there's

1435
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,680
a couple of dozen people of which i'm

1436
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,240
one um that usually gets a phone call

1437
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,000
it's like oh casey probably knows

1438
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
someone like hey dude can you help me

1439
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,920
find the right place to send this issue

1440
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,520
um you know trying to find ways to scale

1441
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,760
that out so it's effectively a forum um

1442
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,359
go check that one out and you know

1443
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:00,480
there's a bunch of other stuff that

1444
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,559
we've got as open source projects i

1445
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,800
think the policymaker one is is the one

1446
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,400
that's most relevant for people that are

1447
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,040
considering launching a program and even

1448
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,040
trying to explain it to other people in

1449
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,119
your team like lawyers look at this and

1450
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:14,720
and breathe a huge sigh of relief

1451
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,319
because they don't have to go through

1452
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,800
all the mental gymnastics of of trying

1453
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,880
to you know write a brand new policy

1454
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,359
that's quite novel for them from a legal

1455
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:26,160
standpoint from scratch so

1456
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,079
shout out to that guy

1457
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,760
all right so in summary and we'll cut to

1458
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,920
questions after this yeah it takes an

1459
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,079
army to outsmart an army the community

1460
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,920
is at the table it's ready to help it's

1461
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,160
doing that we're seeing

1462
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,400
adoption and we're seeing like positive

1463
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,400
impacts of this relationship going

1464
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,960
forward right across the board um

1465
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,800
obviously you know part of how we've

1466
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,280
seen that is that bug crowd as a company

1467
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,800
has grown um

1468
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,559
i get excited about that for obvious

1469
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,640
reasons but i also get excited about

1470
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,280
like what all else goes on outside

1471
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,440
um that doesn't necessarily directly

1472
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,160
translate to or transit to us as as a

1473
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,680
deal or value or whatever else because i

1474
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,119
just do think this is the right thing

1475
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,640
like hackers

1476
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,400
in this position hackers with a similar

1477
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,920
background to myself and others that i

1478
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:10,960
work with

1479
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,000
you know we want to help we've been

1480
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,280
trying to help for a really long time

1481
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,960
it's becoming easier which is awesome

1482
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,640
and yeah there's tremendous leverage

1483
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,559
available to folk that'll think

1484
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:21,680
differently

1485
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,680
and actually take some of this stuff on

1486
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,520
so yeah for those of you in the room who

1487
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,160
are considering this

1488
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,079
from from an implementation standpoint

1489
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:32,079
uh there's a link there

1490
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:33,440
um where you can actually look at the

1491
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,359
crowd platform sign up just have have a

1492
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:37,040
play as a researcher or a hacker you can

1493
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,880
check that out shared a bunch of other

1494
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,319
stuff as well again i'll post these

1495
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:41,520
slides so you can go back through the

1496
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,640
links

1497
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:43,520
um

1498
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,559
and yeah i'll i'll finish off with

1499
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,880
with our patron saint grace hopper you

1500
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,800
know a ship and poor is safe but that's

1501
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,480
not what ships are for

1502
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,559
uh i i do think this

1503
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,839
this acceptance of

1504
00:49:56,839 --> 00:49:59,599
of you know some of the things that that

1505
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,680
could be even a little bit uncomfortable

1506
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,119
to start with when you first start to

1507
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:04,640
interact with the hacker community and

1508
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,920
get their feedback

1509
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,079
um

1510
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:10,000
that's that's the ship it's like you

1511
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,480
know not doing that uh is is keeping the

1512
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,079
ship in poor actually doing that is

1513
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:15,680
actually taking it out and taking

1514
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,680
advantage of everything that's available

1515
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,040
on on the internet you know all the

1516
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,480
brains we have and all the brains we can

1517
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,200
borrow so it's really a matter of

1518
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,119
stepping into that so

1519
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,280
i will end it there

1520
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,000
thank you so much

1521
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,079
any questions

1522
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:39,359
i'm actually not sure how we're going to

1523
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:42,400
do questions here but

1524
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:52,319
can you hear us

1525
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:54,960
yes gotcha good

1526
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,040
i had a question about where you see

1527
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,559
things going from here you talked a

1528
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,079
little bit about how

1529
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:02,319
uh you're doing source code analysis for

1530
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:03,599
your course or you're talking about

1531
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:05,280
message ben testing

1532
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,160
so the kind of evolution of just having

1533
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,880
a bdp or bloodbathing for a web presence

1534
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:11,920
versus

1535
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,920
more of a scoped engagement or a

1536
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,359
targeted time box kind of thing

1537
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,839
yeah no

1538
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:24,000
it's that's a it's a great question um

1539
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:26,720
the interesting thing

1540
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,200
for for us as bug crowd i've seen

1541
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,280
i've seen other platforms in the space

1542
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,880
have have a similar challenge is that

1543
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,040
you know public bug benny programs and

1544
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:39,520
public vdps are so freaking noisy

1545
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,599
that all of the other stuff that you do

1546
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,760
under the hood

1547
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,359
kind of gets drowned out if that makes

1548
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:46,880
sense

1549
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,720
bug crad actually did

1550
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,400
basically crowd source pen testing that

1551
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,240
was the that was the bulk of what we did

1552
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,319
for for the first year or so

1553
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,400
uh before we started building out a

1554
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,400
disclosure management platform

1555
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,280
um

1556
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,119
alongside that so

1557
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:04,240
yeah i mean to your question um i guess

1558
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,520
really what i'm saying is that that's

1559
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,960
already happening now

1560
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,680
this idea of you know

1561
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,200
basically

1562
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,520
connection of distributed talent into

1563
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,040
use cases that are pretty

1564
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,640
counterintuitive before you're doing is

1565
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,520
looking at a kind of web focused uh you

1566
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,720
know bounty programs different things

1567
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,079
like that that's been going on for quite

1568
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:23,359
a long time so

1569
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:24,880
to your question i think it's going to

1570
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,800
expand like you know those those

1571
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,480
different use cases like part of what i

1572
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,440
had

1573
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,240
in in in my thinking um you know

1574
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,599
starting starting the company and

1575
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:35,920
kicking the category off was that

1576
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,599
like this is this is really the future

1577
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:40,640
of work in in a lot of ways um

1578
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,440
not across all of security obviously

1579
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,200
because there's things that you you need

1580
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,760
to be in the same room for those things

1581
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,040
that you need to actually be

1582
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,680
consistently applied to to a problem to

1583
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,559
to be able to solve but for stuff like

1584
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:57,040
you know finding a unique vulnerability

1585
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,520
um you know testing a social engineering

1586
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,280
strategy like even down to like

1587
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,680
analyzing malware um you know doing a

1588
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,440
source code review uh you know tearing

1589
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,160
apart a car and and seeing um what kind

1590
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,839
of vulnerabilities might exist in in the

1591
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,760
construction of that car

1592
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:12,640
yeah

1593
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,200
it's to me

1594
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,760
mostly a matter of trying to connect

1595
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,280
the best possible talent with the

1596
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,359
problem that needs to be solved

1597
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:22,960
um

1598
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,800
you know obviously there's a there's a

1599
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,319
reason for doing that from a work and an

1600
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:27,920
opportunity standpoint but the biggest

1601
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,119
thing i think is because that's how the

1602
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:31,359
bad guys do it so so the reason they're

1603
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:33,040
so successful is because that's how they

1604
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,079
operate um which is why i think it's

1605
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,160
it's going to continue forward in in

1606
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,520
that sense

1607
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,400
um you know regardless frankly of of

1608
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,960
what folks like me do to try to

1609
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,240
facilitate that i think there's more of

1610
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,000
a sucking sound around it than anything

1611
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,160
else

1612
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,000
can i answer your question

1613
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,599
any other question

1614
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:02,640
