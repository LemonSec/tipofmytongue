1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,439
good afternoon everyone thank you for

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,440
coming out to corncon and yes john is

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,320
right i'm as old as dirk as far as i'm

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,720
concerned

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,320
uh

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,160
john's been on an office conference and

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,679
i've always

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,880
supported the community as much as i can

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,640
and this is some of the areas

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,640
that i kind of wanted to bring out with

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,519
that um to give a talk a little bit

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,640
about that from a corporate introductory

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,720
perspective with that i see so for lower

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,520
level mobility i have responsibility for

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,960
our parent company

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,320
as well so on a day my day job is

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,079
managing

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,680
a global organization that has

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,840
60 billion dollars in revenue operates

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,480
in 170 countries around the world

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,000
uh

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,079
then it does things at scale

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,120
that usually most organizations don't

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,039
on that side of it so

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,840
that being said i've been cso now

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,079
going on 15 years

27
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,239
so i've been to the place i've had

28
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,720
different reporting structure i've had

29
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,799
different owners of the company i worked

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,840
for google for a while

31
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,119
uh i worked for the roll up as a whole

32
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,000
and so i rewarded up for things so 15

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,520
years can be sliced

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,640
however you want to but i stay around

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,720
i'll also give you some other

36
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,880
points of interest on that i have the

37
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,880
same team that i started with 15 years

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,320
ago uh except for two people who got

39
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,040
sucked in by the google store uh and

40
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,119
could not come back and the other person

41
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,320
had to retire or wanted to retire

42
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,799
so uh it's pretty much the same proof

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,240
that i've been doing with new editions

44
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,399
from that side of it that's there

45
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,600
um

46
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,640
as everything goes um i really wish

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,159
ransomware would have encrypted my

48
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,320
slides but it didn't so you're in for a

49
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,840
presentation

50
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,240
so i always use a background reading

51
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,079
perspective

52
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,439
which says

53
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,520
this is usually how i feel than most of

54
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,719
the times where i go

55
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,520
the center cartoon is one of my favorite

56
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,360
far side cartoons i have a coffee cup

57
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,800
for it and everything else because i

58
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,280
feel this is the perfect scenario for

59
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,640
cyber security

60
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,959
we go into these situations where we're

61
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,959
looking at things and it doesn't matter

62
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,480
our choice

63
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,319
we're damaged or do be damned if we

64
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,920
don't which whatever we're gonna choose

65
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,239
and that is usually the paradox that

66
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,040
we're hit uh nine times out of ten

67
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,840
uh if i fix this this breaks if i don't

68
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,239
fix it this other thing happens just

69
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,560
even worse than if i break things

70
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,120
and so you run into those scenarios

71
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,239
daily

72
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:42,959
and

73
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,440
how you navigate those scenarios and how

74
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,400
you

75
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,720
communicate those scenarios it's kind of

76
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,400
the key to success

77
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,480
in a lot of areas

78
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,959
that's there

79
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,480
i have an interesting back story i've

80
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,000
worked for

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,239
large organizations

82
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,560
i do a lot of tweeting you can follow me

83
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,519
at sec rich on twitter uh i post things

84
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,000
out there almost daily on that you can

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,760
find me

86
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,640
in a linkedin fairly easy uh that's

87
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,879
there i'm not the rocket scientist that

88
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,840
works uh in birmingham

89
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,959
but uh i'm the other one uh that's there

90
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,519
uh for those and my wife usually comes

91
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,680
to conferences she'll be here tomorrow

92
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,319
uh we're kind of a partnership of doing

93
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,440
crazy things together that's there we

94
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,640
kind of

95
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,000
work together

96
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,599
in a lot of cases she's not in cyber

97
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,480
security but she has been around it long

98
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,519
enough that she she does do things and

99
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,280
hooks me in the right directions in most

100
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,799
of the cases that's there

101
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,959
i've done this all my life

102
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,280
i've done my first

103
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,080
pin test was back in 1984

104
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,560
which was a dial-up modem bank for a

105
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,200
bank located at valley national bank

106
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,680
located in phoenix arizona at the time

107
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,200
that was there that was my first pin

108
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,000
test that i had paid for and that i did

109
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,080
and all i had to do was guess a password

110
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,760
to the motorbank that was there that was

111
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,080
a pin test at those points in time that

112
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,320
was there and i've produced that all the

113
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,720
way through i've done this pretty much

114
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,720
like i said most of my life has been in

115
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,120
security i've worked for large companies

116
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,120
i've also founded a bunch of startups

117
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,960
along the way so i've done multiple

118
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,520
things that were around it i've done

119
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,880
writing

120
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,800
this is an article how we've hacked the

121
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,840
white house

122
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,440
agents go

123
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,720
in dark reading

124
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,520
i've done stuff on wi-fi security this

125
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,479
was right after the tgx exploits and we

126
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,240
talked about wireless security and how

127
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,360
there really was none and if the area

128
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,360
that circled down at the bottom

129
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,880
basically discusses the default

130
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,800
passwords account they're really bad and

131
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,040
they're pretty much standard in some of

132
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,360
those areas not much has changed in

133
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,040
those periods of time those are still

134
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,400
issues we deal with today

135
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,680
so

136
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,639
this is my my other side why did we go

137
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,320
wrong because we usually come to a point

138
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,240
where we have to stop and we have to

139
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,560
choose the direction that we need to go

140
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,039
uh in cyber security and this is part of

141
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,160
the issue some people that have a longer

142
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,639
life more security may select one

143
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,520
direction other select other directions

144
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,560
um and we don't really have good areas

145
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,240
but one of the things that i thought was

146
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,400
very interesting this came out of the

147
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,880
corporate executive board and from a

148
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,720
gartner organization where they looked

149
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,520
at metrics they looked at the way people

150
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,759
generate stuff because that's how

151
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,600
organizations and that's the first thing

152
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,080
people will tell you generate stuff so

153
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,479
you can show what you're doing

154
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,280
that's good but you need to understand

155
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,240
that just by just making mounds of paper

156
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,880
powerpoint slides excel spreadsheets

157
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,199
doesn't mean anybody's reading it

158
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,880
and that's exactly what these surveys

159
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,759
actually said was one 60 of these

160
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,960
metrics are manual process so it takes

161
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,600
your staff or yourself time and effort

162
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,199
to produce things

163
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,600
but on the other side of it

164
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,560
it's only used about 25 of the time to

165
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,479
make decisions

166
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,319
so the rest of the 75 it's a gut where

167
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,400
it's like we've done this before

168
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,800
or something else and i think that's one

169
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,400
of the things is you're making all this

170
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,360
work

171
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,120
to make something that's going to make

172
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,919
better decisions yet no one actually

173
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,199
uses it

174
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,639
to make decisions

175
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,240
hence part of the problems that are

176
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,440
there

177
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,800
and i think that's one of the things

178
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,039
that go and then as you move up the

179
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,560
ladder

180
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,240
most people don't understand it a third

181
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,479
of them

182
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,400
they don't see it on a regular basis

183
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,160
because there's not a cadence there's

184
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,440
not a

185
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,080
monthly meeting reportedly meaning

186
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,160
semi-annual annual meeting where you're

187
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,000
presenting findings

188
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,160
that are there and if you're not doing

189
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,000
it often enough it's going to be a

190
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
surprise every time

191
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,479
it's there

192
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,319
almost a quarter of them is mixed no

193
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,599
difference it's not part of their

194
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,680
decision making process

195
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,039
dollars

196
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,880
cost

197
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,400
people

198
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,800
those fit into some of those decisions

199
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,479
risks

200
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,000
security

201
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,759
don't often fit

202
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,599
and i think that's one of the things and

203
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,039
again it's about 10

204
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,000
are used for influencing decisions so

205
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,160
you're coming from a position when you

206
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,599
start doing this

207
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,280
of like

208
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,199
how am i going to get better how am i

209
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,039
going to show i'm getting better

210
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,759
how do i convince people that i need to

211
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,479
do the right thing and that's a portion

212
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,319
of the things that like wrong is that

213
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,240
hard and so i took a look at that and

214
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,440
said why is it so difficult what's wrong

215
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,039
with this i've been doing this a real

216
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,680
long time and i've been good at it

217
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,319
what's secrets to success or some of the

218
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,400
other things that are around them it's

219
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,520
just not my gray hair or my lack of hair

220
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,160
um what is it that's part of that and i

221
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,440
think it's one of the ways this

222
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,479
perspective has a lot to do with it i

223
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,680
came in from the world of the dark parts

224
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,000
the black hat whatever you wish to call

225
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
it came in from

226
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,919
the outside and into this because there

227
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,479
wasn't cyber security when i was growing

228
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,919
up i

229
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,599
when i went to

230
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,280
school for university and everything

231
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,479
else i went to my first computer

232
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,958
information management

233
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,519
function and we had a speaker coming in

234
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,880
and that was the first time i asked a

235
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,399
question i was like what are you working

236
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,039
on oh we're working on this

237
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,959
at the time it would be equivalent to a

238
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,640
crm tool

239
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,120
written in cobalt running on a mainframe

240
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,279
and i was like oh that's good so what

241
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,800
else do you work on well i've been

242
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,120
working on that same code for the last

243
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,920
nine and a half years i was like i this

244
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,000
is not for me i'm out of here

245
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,480
because for me that was not where i

246
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,200
wanted to be because i'm not i don't

247
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,519
want to work on the same thing for nine

248
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,480
and a half years i will unfortunately

249
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,399
probably die of boredom or something

250
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,640
around my mind i need other things that

251
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,320
i want to be able to do and i think this

252
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,320
is the perspective that i said well

253
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,480
let's take a pic how would you attack

254
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,680
how would you

255
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,399
get into your network that's what cyber

256
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,800
security you're trying to stop bad

257
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,640
things from happening so how do those

258
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,279
bad things happen just go to the root of

259
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,000
the cause whether it's internal whether

260
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,680
it's external packers criminals all

261
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,320
these elements how are they doing it and

262
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
looking at it so first you gotta look at

263
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,440
yourself

264
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,200
because it's like hey am i getting

265
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,160
robbed because i'm using an atm at 2 am

266
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,440
in a bad neighborhood oh yeah okay don't

267
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,320
do that anymore that can be a very quick

268
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,880
thing but is it portion of that so how

269
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,880
is your networks how do you see do you

270
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,760
even have visibility into those

271
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,640
do you know where things exist anymore

272
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,640
and is it the same way that you thought

273
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,000
it was

274
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,360
because again i

275
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,120
stretch a long period of time i looked

276
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,959
at this five years ago and this is the

277
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,839
way it looked i look at it today

278
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,519
completely different

279
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,120
technologies changing everything else

280
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,160
well

281
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,320
that's not the way we designed it that's

282
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,880
not the way it was orchestrated as part

283
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,279
of that and you just stepped down

284
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,560
through it

285
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,560
awareness are your employees aware of

286
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,480
things do they need to be reminded of

287
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,920
things

288
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,240
and then how do you train people

289
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,160
um one of the key things that i've

290
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,720
leveraged and used in the past are tests

291
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,560
that people are like

292
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,200
my tests well i can either produce a lot

293
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,800
of power points

294
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,279
and you go through or i can just say hey

295
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,880
we're trying to collect information can

296
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,600
you take this survey for us and figure

297
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,720
things out and you have three answers

298
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,920
what's the correct answer the other two

299
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,640
are thought provoking questions and i

300
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,720
mean by thought provoking not like

301
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,920
what's this think of like asset access

302
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,240
management and controls of that and

303
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,920
you're trying to tell people about

304
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,920
changing passwords and everything else

305
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,079
around that you can say that oh do you

306
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,760
realize that your passwords need to be

307
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,880
changed every 90 days 60 days 30 days

308
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,959
whatever your flavor is

309
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,000
on that is the question but you can also

310
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,720
go back password should be simple

311
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,160
and you're like well that's the wrong

312
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,720
answer but it causes the user to think

313
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,160
and it causes those areas to go oh our

314
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,519
passwords

315
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,760
aren't should be short you can even know

316
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,959
that you actually should be long and

317
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,480
they should do that so this is the

318
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,760
correct

319
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,920
one but instead of them going through

320
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,639
three powerpoint slides one single

321
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,880
question got their thought process

322
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,880
provoked on that side of it so it

323
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,120
becomes a training exercise and they

324
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,040
don't even know it's a training exercise

325
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,639
for what they're trying to do because

326
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,639
you're building that relationship with

327
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,320
them but you're also

328
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,279
kind of

329
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,079
coercing them into a decision that

330
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,720
you're trying to get without them going

331
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,920
through i was like oh i don't want to

332
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,519
take training again another death by

333
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,440
power woman we've all been there and

334
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,000
it's there so you really have to know

335
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,560
thy enemy but you have to in doing so

336
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,480
you need to know yourself and you need

337
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,639
to learn to think how the enemy is going

338
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,800
to attack your network because if you're

339
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,839
still on

340
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,519
the idea where hey i am safe in here

341
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,240
you're living in a world that doesn't

342
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,800
exist it's full of unicorns and poonies

343
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,760
that's great but the real world is all

344
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,120
black and

345
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,120
not a pleasant place

346
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,880
on the internet that's actually there

347
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,720
so part of this was the idea to say hey

348
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,800
is this like a mission impossible

349
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,880
can it even be done is this something

350
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,839
that is is google would call a moon shot

351
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,440
is this something that is just out of

352
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,240
the norm that's actually out there and

353
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,839
it's like

354
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,160
no not really it's not an impossible

355
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,639
mission it's work

356
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,800
but that's what security is about

357
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,600
it's about work there's always something

358
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,720
to do

359
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,800
on the other side of it that's why i

360
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,680
like it that's why i stay here as

361
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,760
there's something to do there's a cause

362
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,560
and an effect that's there yes there's

363
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,880
lots of running involved just like in

364
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,480
the mission impossible

365
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,639
you're gonna run there's a lot of moving

366
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,120
parts in your organization so yes

367
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,519
there's a lot of complexity that you

368
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,120
have to unwind unbox untangle to

369
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,839
understand truly the way things are

370
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,160
either built work or process that's

371
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,040
there

372
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,120
if you don't know how your organizations

373
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,440
built something from start to finish or

374
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,440
how it produces something or how the

375
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,760
services are delivered and everything

376
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,959
else it's hard to understand how you're

377
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,680
going to make it better when you start

378
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,839
trying to put controls and constraints

379
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,560
and other things around things they're

380
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,920
like oh that'll break that that will

381
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,560
make your things go our marketing

382
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,079
company won't be able to send email

383
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,480
anymore okay you just turned over the

384
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,560
apple cart as part of that but we'll be

385
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,720
more secure

386
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,800
you're going to lose that argument

387
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,680
so you have to figure out how to argue

388
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,440
with someone and i'm like the same thing

389
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,639
i have

390
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,720
kids and it's like arguing with kids is

391
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,079
much different than our game with

392
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,680
parents

393
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,839
that side of it that's there you you

394
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,399
have the same and i'm like okay how am i

395
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,760
going to use the manipulative word but

396
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,079
how do i how do i how do i change your

397
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,920
opinion on something how do i do

398
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,959
something around it and it's a little

399
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,160
more different

400
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,880
so you really have to look at that

401
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,120
um

402
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,440
there's bad news as part of this because

403
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,920
as you get into this area and wanting to

404
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,440
make changes

405
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,199
you are

406
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,760
you accepted the mission whether you

407
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,360
said yes or no

408
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,959
you accepted it

409
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,399
the question is

410
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,320
if it goes wrong

411
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,000
um what

412
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,880
there's an impossible you will disavow

413
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,880
they'll be like we don't know him

414
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,360
he's gone he's no longer here

415
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,320
um bad things happen

416
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,360
they're not always if you if you are

417
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,680
guilty of it the best thing is mess up

418
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,120
and say yes

419
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,480
i missed that

420
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,759
i did it

421
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,560
on that but at the other side of it

422
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,399
hey there's not any protocols or

423
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,399
anything else that's there

424
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,320
that is an issue and you're gonna have

425
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,560
to live with that but don't let it

426
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,279
paralyze you into making non-decisions i

427
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,959
see a lot of people that are i don't

428
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:45,759
want to

429
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,680
rock the apple card or anything else you

430
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,800
shouldn't be

431
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,480
you should never have that decision

432
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,120
that's there things are baby steps it's

433
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,000
not a security is not a binary function

434
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,079
that's on or off like a light switch

435
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,320
that i turn on and grip if the lights

436
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,320
come on and turn it off and it delights

437
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,120
go off it is a dimmer switch and i can

438
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,959
take small incremental steps it needs to

439
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,199
be brighter it needs to be bright it's

440
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,399
right it may not be as fast if they may

441
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,800
not be as that but you can at least take

442
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,759
those time to be able to do it otherwise

443
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,360
you're going to be like flipping it's

444
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,320
like oh

445
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,560
factory down bad

446
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,440
uh oops factories back on well

447
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,240
productions now has to be reset and yeah

448
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,560
that's not something that you want to do

449
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,360
but

450
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,560
if you've got enough

451
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,120
capital or social capital in your

452
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,519
organization that they trust you

453
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,759
which part of security is about trust

454
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,680
they already do

455
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,199
that's inherent

456
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,759
for what you actually do

457
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,360
so they trust you so use that trust

458
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,519
um on that side lean into that don't shy

459
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,199
away from it

460
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,000
and you've discovered that you're safe

461
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,199
when you're out going in a lot of things

462
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,799
the business will ask you to do the

463
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,439
possibility they do it

464
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,559
every week

465
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,000
of hey and this

466
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,319
no no no no can you put this into the

467
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,359
cloud

468
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,599
no

469
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,160
you will be asked to do the impossible

470
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,959
and you may be required

471
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,599
to do the impossible

472
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,799
that's there

473
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,799
and those are things that are you have

474
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,600
to kind of adjust accordingly it's like

475
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
this is a really bad idea that's great

476
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,840
we're still doing it um but it's a

477
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,720
really bad idea okay i can't walk away

478
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,120
from it

479
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,240
because in doing so you're getting that

480
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,799
sour rape story

481
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,640
because it's like oh you just don't

482
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,240
wanna you just wanna work on the easy

483
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,240
stuff the simple stuff you don't wanna

484
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,080
do the hard things

485
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,160
and it's like no this is the dumb thing

486
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,559
that i don't wanna do but

487
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,919
we'll be here

488
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,360
we will help

489
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,320
just when bad things happen i do get to

490
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,120
do that i told you so dance uh at your

491
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,280
next staff meeting because i did tell

492
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,960
you that it was going to happen and it

493
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,080
did and so but that

494
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,760
doesn't give him much satisfaction i've

495
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,200
done it enough times

496
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,600
uh but it's part of the site that's

497
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,840
there

498
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,760
but i think one of the other things

499
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,559
that's offered there is

500
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,280
we often overlook of why

501
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,039
people can't do so

502
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,200
is there a hindrance that i don't have

503
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,880
resources people

504
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,280
cost no money budget

505
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,600
et cetera is there some reason that i'm

506
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,080
not doing this i'm busy

507
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,600
everybody's 120 utilized i can't add any

508
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,639
more to their plates

509
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,520
and those are topics that you need to

510
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,880
bring up

511
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,320
before it

512
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,320
because if you're not bringing things up

513
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,080
ahead of time especially around

514
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,120
resources and constraints that you have

515
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,600
for doing things you will run into

516
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,160
problems when you now pop up the oh we

517
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,160
need more people everybody needs more

518
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,520
people and you're not getting more

519
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,840
people because it's late in the program

520
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,760
things budgets have already been aligned

521
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,520
things have already been done cost

522
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,840
estimates given and changing that

523
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,880
upstream is now problematic so you want

524
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,240
to be really really upfront with people

525
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,400
uh that's there and there's nothing

526
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,600
wrong with it

527
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,520
and there's nothing wrong with sounding

528
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,679
like a broken record

529
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,200
that says and

530
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,000
hey

531
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,400
i always mean people always need money

532
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,559
every single meeting need more people

533
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,919
need more money and that's like you

534
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,760
sound like a world record because it's

535
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,960
true

536
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,280
not lying not telling you nothing this

537
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,320
is what's needed you want me to be still

538
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,039
this way and still what we're doing this

539
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,120
is where we're going at that level and i

540
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,320
think that's super important

541
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,400
now the question is how many

542
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,400
missions do you go on how many things

543
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,280
are there what depends how much is your

544
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,159
environment changing how much is fluid

545
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,720
how much is legacy how much is

546
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,320
organization and there are certain

547
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
levels every organization is different

548
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,240
every management structure is different

549
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,280
every personality is different

550
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,120
there's a lot of difference in there

551
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,440
they all have to come together work

552
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,440
together to have an outcome that's going

553
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,120
to be a success

554
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:29,840
so

555
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,679
all those differences need to be

556
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,360
addressed as you're going through that

557
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,280
and that's oftentimes they're looking

558
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,720
out for this

559
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,320
um

560
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,080
one of the things i've always looked at

561
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,720
is things like

562
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,200
maturity index and people talk about

563
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,600
cyber security maturity and i'm like

564
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,520
what does that mean old

565
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,039
you think about it people always like

566
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,440
hey it's people processing technology

567
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,360
wow we have old people

568
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,440
running whole processes

569
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,559
and old hardware that doesn't sound good

570
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,720
and i was like okay step back that's not

571
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,880
what you wanted and i think that's one

572
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,120
of the issues that comes up and you see

573
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,360
it a lot of times with compliance people

574
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,120
are like oh work apply

575
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,280
well what's the scope of your compliance

576
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,240
see oh it's this one data center and in

577
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,400
that data center there's a rack and in

578
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,280
that rack it's it's compliant so

579
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,720
whatever standards you want to and

580
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,080
you're like well

581
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,840
that's good but your scope is really

582
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,000
narrow right focus that may be because

583
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,400
hey that business requires it

584
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,120
but everything else is just

585
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,880
you've seen the pictures of things

586
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,799
cables everywhere they're like okay but

587
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,480
one clean rack is the good one and

588
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,480
everything else is that really going to

589
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,600
work well

590
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,080
so you start looking at things that's

591
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,360
there

592
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,840
people try to things like well

593
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,520
this is big this is hard

594
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,440
it's not that people are like oh i need

595
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,559
a framework

596
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,400
frameworks work

597
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,400
compliance works

598
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,320
and the issue is that

599
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,320
you have to be mature in your process

600
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,679
you have to be mature in your

601
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,400
organization for those to actually work

602
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,960
from the get-go if you're not you're

603
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,880
spending a lot of extra time trying to

604
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,720
mature your things

605
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,679
over a period of time i cannot go take

606
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,760
wine that has just been

607
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,880
crushed in a barrel somewhere and it's

608
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,360
been in there 30 minutes and go i want

609
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,120
to mature this to five years

610
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,600
now it takes five years

611
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,080
so the maturity of an organization

612
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,600
takes time you can't have no shortcuts

613
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,200
there are no shortcuts it takes time to

614
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,960
do that and i think that is one of the

615
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,360
key areas that often people overlook is

616
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,039
they take a framework or they take a

617
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,880
compliance and they go this will just

618
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,799
work

619
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,000
these processes are not mine these

620
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,640
controls are not mine how is this going

621
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,919
to work i've got to change everything

622
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,440
it takes time

623
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,840
i think that's what a lot of people get

624
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,919
hung up around it's like hey it's been

625
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,360
24 months

626
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,200
why isn't the world changed and it's

627
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,559
like what

628
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,600
in 35 years

629
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,280
still dealing with freaking password

630
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,678
issues

631
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,200
takes time

632
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,640
as part of that

633
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,360
now as a part of that focus is to keep

634
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,280
because there is things coming after you

635
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,080
from every vantage point noon

636
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,799
and once you get popular once that you

637
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,919
find it they will win

638
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,520
it doesn't go down

639
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,440
my inbox is folded

640
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,360
on things of hey

641
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,120
can you look can you do this what about

642
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,240
this

643
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,200
there is more and more and more

644
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,480
that's

645
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,840
a good thing

646
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,159
but you need to keep a focus because you

647
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,400
can't do everything no matter how big

648
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,960
your team is it is not going to be able

649
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,840
to deal with the influx of things as

650
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,760
things pick up and do

651
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,840
as part of that changing a security

652
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,840
culture or working to change security

653
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,080
culture in an organization

654
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,159
that becomes security aware kind of like

655
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,120
ai awareness how security is important

656
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,320
guess what they're going to talk to

657
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,600
security team before they do anything

658
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,440
how do you manage that

659
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,039
and that's the problem you got to stay

660
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,679
focused on what is important

661
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,320
and then what you need to do to

662
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,640
to fix the rest of it because they just

663
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,440
can't stand they're asking for help

664
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,000
if they don't get an answer

665
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,559
they're not going to respond anymore but

666
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,000
if they get an answer they'll ask you

667
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,080
more questions

668
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,600
so you it is a yin and yang you really

669
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,440
have to look it's like what can i focus

670
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,400
on what is low hanging fruit what is hey

671
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,960
we don't have time and it's part of the

672
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,320
same thing when you're talking with

673
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,880
people and communicating just be honest

674
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,120
you know i can't get to that until

675
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,360
october

676
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,960
is that okay

677
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,919
and if their answer is no we go live in

678
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,679
september well how long have you known

679
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,520
about it and you can you can put the

680
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,440
evil hat back on

681
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,159
hey

682
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,039
your your poor planning does not

683
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,640
justify me

684
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,799
changing

685
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,360
so you can play whatever you want to but

686
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,200
you do have to communicate ignoring

687
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,120
things will just silence things and all

688
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,120
that good effort

689
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,159
goes away and just imagine too that good

690
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,200
effort you're doing try not to do things

691
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,720
that are too

692
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,200
crazy and notification and increased

693
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,159
voice

694
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,919
in some of those cases

695
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,320
of changing something oh we're going to

696
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,640
do this is the only way you'll create

697
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,440
more animosity than most of the time but

698
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,200
you do have to manage your time very

699
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,440
well

700
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,799
that's there

701
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,039
and

702
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,600
i think from the maturity

703
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,679
you look at it and people say what

704
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,720
really is it and it's like hey we assess

705
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,520
the effectiveness of a person or a group

706
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,240
that's there and it helps us derive some

707
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,840
capabilities

708
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,919
in order to improve performance it's a

709
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,600
quality metric if you want to think

710
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,960
about it

711
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,279
hey is it good quality bad quality what

712
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,960
will make it better

713
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,000
just there

714
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,880
but

715
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,440
it's very narrow it's very looking and

716
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,080
it's very focused on some of those areas

717
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,039
and i think a lot of people just say hey

718
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,720
here's our maturity model it's the five

719
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,720
steps we're

720
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,240
at two

721
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,919
we're at four

722
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,159
i can survey an organization and given

723
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,400
the title set and where

724
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,320
i'm asking the question if i go to vps

725
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,000
and everything else they will give

726
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,440
between threes and fours senior vps give

727
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,559
fours to fives

728
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,000
if i go ask the engineers they give ones

729
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,400
and twos

730
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,039
because they're like this is just f up

731
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,480
sorry for dropping a bomb but it's true

732
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,279
but

733
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,360
who i ask determines my maturity of my

734
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,080
organization whoa that's not right

735
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,159
so this is where i start getting in some

736
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,240
of these areas where that rating side of

737
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,640
it is it's not that maturity it's yeah

738
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,520
we're taking things and not making sense

739
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,640
for them

740
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,840
in other words

741
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,760
the person the engineers that are

742
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,360
measuring the ones and the two those are

743
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,480
the real

744
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,039
ratings but they never get elevated up

745
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,640
just like the information that they

746
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,799
provide as it moves through

747
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,559
this telephone tag side of the equation

748
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,240
go to the same thing

749
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,720
like oh this is not important this is

750
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,039
not there where is it actually out and i

751
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,880
think that's one of the other sides of

752
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,360
it now people have looked at maternity

753
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,760
cycles and say you can do a top-down

754
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,679
approach which is your classic stair

755
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:52,559
step

756
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,480
one through five you can do what is a

757
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,399
bottom-up approach where they'll say hey

758
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,360
these are clusters so if you have two

759
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,120
levels of maturity we'll cluster all

760
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,039
those together because maybe it's a

761
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,880
system that we can fix

762
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,039
and we can increase it and so they have

763
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,880
a clustering idea to say hey put all

764
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,799
these objects or all these things that

765
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,600
you're asking about for maturity scale

766
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,000
into a cluster and see if it correlates

767
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,799
together instead of having 500 things

768
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,880
you're now having 50 things to be able

769
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,919
to deal with and some of that but again

770
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,960
it's people technology processes that

771
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,960
are there that you're measuring on those

772
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,480
sides of it that's there

773
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,880
uh and if we were really measuring

774
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,200
technology you would not have legacy in

775
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,880
your environment

776
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,960
so we're not really measuring

777
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,039
or maybe we're measuring wrong

778
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,840
because the main frame you know

779
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,200
what if you look at the maturity level

780
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,960
hey it's got a 5.

781
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,080
it's almost as mature as like windows xp

782
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,480
that's been around for 35 years you can

783
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,640
sit there and go well yeah age has

784
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,320
something to do with it but it doesn't

785
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,720
make anything different it's

786
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,640
about the controls and some of the other

787
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,799
aspects that are there

788
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,399
always think about the actions of people

789
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,679
out in the world

790
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:06,640
if

791
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,320
it's bad

792
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,880
and they can do nothing about it that's

793
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,200
a problem

794
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,919
it's two problems on two front one

795
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,520
you can't do something about risk and

796
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,559
that's

797
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,080
a bad thing

798
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,760
but secondly

799
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,000
you don't have a choice so

800
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,679
on the other side of it if i can do

801
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,679
something why is it not done

802
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,039
and i think it's one of the key things

803
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,559
you see it time and time again somebody

804
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:31,679
will be like

805
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,840
oh you didn't do your accessory cookie

806
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,159
right when you built the application and

807
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:38,640
then developers like yes i did you're

808
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,799
like oh

809
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
and you're like oh here here's burp and

810
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,760
look and i just

811
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,640
got three two laptops and a power supply

812
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,320
shipped to my house for free is that

813
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,440
okay

814
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,279
uh and they're like oh yeah we'll fix

815
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,520
that but you had to take that effort to

816
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,320
prove to them because they looked at you

817
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,640
and said i don't do anything wrong but

818
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,120
that action is the action that you

819
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,360
wanted to occur on the outside so

820
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,799
action's always going to speak louder

821
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,880
than words corrective action so we'll

822
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,760
speak hey we fix something

823
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,440
you should always take credit for things

824
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,520
that you fix

825
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,799
because most of the time you fix

826
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,399
something

827
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,080
and we're off to something else and no

828
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,320
one knows about it except for that small

829
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,600
little group

830
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,600
that was there that you helped

831
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,919
the problem is that hey they don't tell

832
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,000
people and they don't communicate

833
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,320
and if you're trying to grow that

834
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,159
cultural wise and everything else and

835
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,360
maturity wise you need to communicate

836
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,240
that and communicate it up well that hey

837
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,640
i fixed this

838
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,799
and here and you don't have to tell them

839
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:45,679
how

840
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,919
you just fixed it

841
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,080
and that's all they care about okay

842
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,520
that's something that's checked on the

843
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,600
checkbox because eventually what ends up

844
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,080
happening is you end up going like oh we

845
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,600
have all these findings that no one's

846
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,159
taken care of oh well we did

847
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,760
okay we didn't report on that but no

848
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,559
one's tracking it no one's seeing it

849
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,360
that's there now hey let's not if return

850
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,039
a lot it gives you a finding wow you've

851
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,480
got to do something immediately on that

852
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,279
one on my point on cyber security

853
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,600
you're like oh yeah that's important too

854
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,480
but

855
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,399
you your actions always speak louder

856
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,720
than words

857
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,240
and who you ask

858
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,880
will always be those results but also

859
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,559
who you tell

860
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,720
is just as important enough questions

861
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,399
that are asked that are part of that

862
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,159
one of the most common things is like

863
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,240
hey i need to identify

864
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,440
my risk

865
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,600
what's what keeps me up at night

866
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,760
and whether it's at the executive level

867
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,240
board level everything else who we're

868
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,640
communicating with and everything else

869
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,279
wow and i tell people the first thing is

870
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,080
you need to know what you have

871
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,840
and people are like i do

872
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,600
and then i ask how many laptops do you

873
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,559
have

874
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,559
and the first answer is like

875
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,080
around

876
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,320
5 000 and i'm like that's not the answer

877
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,720
you need

878
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,159
unless your answer was well it was 498

879
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,240
yesterday and i'm pretty sure we had two

880
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,159
new employees getting new ones that's

881
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,039
there that's a different answer but

882
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,880
should be exact numbers how many cloud

883
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,960
instances do you have how many of other

884
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,840
things you have to do what you have if

885
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,960
i'm actually trying to secure anything

886
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,320
that's there and you really have to

887
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,080
hammer on that because i can tell you

888
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,320
the world of like hey

889
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,240
i don't know but i can go look it up in

890
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,559
my cmdb

891
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,320
i'm liking it's not going to strike me

892
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,880
at this point in time but we all know

893
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,240
that it's like oh that stuff that was

894
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,640
outdated like three years ago and not

895
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,559
accurate whatsoever so where's the

896
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,320
source of truth who has the source of

897
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,399
truth does anybody have the source of

898
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:53,679
truth

899
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,480
and no one's gonna come up and say yeah

900
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,640
this is 100 accurate

901
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,320
doesn't need to be but it needs to be

902
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,320
somewhere close

903
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,279
so it's there because hey is this our

904
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,919
internal id address external are cloud

905
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,080
instances what's going on how is this

906
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,720
there and that's a portion of it so once

907
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,960
you kind of build that

908
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,720
first

909
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,880
you can get it on the next leg

910
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,960
take that all that information and slice

911
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,200
it into it as many ways as you can think

912
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,799
of using it

913
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,519
slice it into geographic location so hey

914
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,039
if i want to know all the systems in

915
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,760
china i can get a fee

916
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,039
hey if i want to know what type of admin

917
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,519
systems are out there here it is my

918
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,440
phone and type of my windows 2003 that

919
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,880
are end of life here it is

920
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,799
slice and dice the data in all these

921
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,600
different ways and keep it

922
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,760
so that it's always because you'll use

923
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,640
it

924
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,720
it'll help you make decisions but if

925
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,880
that is not there

926
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,519
how are you making your decision

927
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,279
how do i know if i need to push this

928
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,919
patch for adobe reader when i don't even

929
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,399
know how many people have adobe reader

930
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:07,600
and i don't know what it's going to

931
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,839
impact maybe it's five

932
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,399
maybe it's 50 000.

933
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,079
there's an issue and i need to

934
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,079
understand that and until i actually

935
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,399
know what i have making decisions and

936
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,480
flying by the seat of your pants or

937
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,000
using your gut

938
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,440
you're not making good informed

939
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,879
decisions

940
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,359
that's there

941
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,119
and then once you're done with that

942
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,159
rank

943
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,520
the assets and what i mean by rank

944
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,359
is it important or not because there are

945
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,040
some of our assets that are not

946
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,040
important as far as i'm concerned

947
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,480
uh that may be important to other

948
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,918
departments

949
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,599
and supporters of things and people are

950
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,599
like well how do you verify importance

951
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,000
because if i ask every different group

952
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,440
every group is going to tell me yes

953
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,800
mine's important

954
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,079
critical to the business that's there

955
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,400
the business won't run anymore if this

956
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,160
goes down

957
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,599
you're like okay

958
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,359
so how do i verify that because

959
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,320
everybody's going to tell me

960
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,680
everything's important and then i just

961
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,280
have a list of everything's important

962
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,599
about that sucks

963
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,520
so how do i verify that

964
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,720
use your own

965
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,960
information go into your ticketing

966
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,720
system help desk

967
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,800
see if those systems are marked as a p1

968
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,720
critical vulnerability

969
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,800
so if something happens it immediately

970
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,560
escalates to p1

971
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,839
guess what those are your critical

972
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,720
systems already been done ra verified

973
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,400
already there if it's not in there

974
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,560
maybe you should elevate it

975
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,040
or maybe not maybe

976
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,640
it's more important to that department

977
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,960
not to the rest of the company

978
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,839
but

979
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,240
help desk tickets are a great way to see

980
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,920
what is critical and what is not

981
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,400
critical because if it's built around

982
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,359
that and it's an itunes system yes

983
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,119
business owned systems they not even

984
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,640
have how it does

985
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,960
but they'll scream if it's down

986
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,680
so look for those kind of things that

987
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,720
are there

988
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,400
don't you don't have to create new data

989
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,160
you don't have to create an index you

990
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,880
don't have to try to do something but

991
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,440
you can look and say okay i have no idea

992
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,119
well does it contain

993
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,440
any of the kind of data that you were

994
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,560
scared that somebody else has pii

995
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,400
privacy data customer data employee data

996
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,800
what's on it where is it at

997
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,960
what can happen with that i think those

998
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,400
are the critical things you can ask

999
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,640
yourself and make it a simple decision

1000
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,640
but you also have the data that

1001
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,880
empirically that's out there already and

1002
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,200
i think that's one of the key areas

1003
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,000
that's part of that

1004
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,400
risk is not simple

1005
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,560
everybody's seeing this heat map

1006
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,440
don't

1007
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,480
ever

1008
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,620
use the heat map

1009
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,000
[Music]

1010
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,599
uh

1011
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,440
it's not a good visualization it works

1012
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,200
great for people like oh this is great

1013
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,200
but it's part of the thing risk is not

1014
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,400
simple

1015
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,839
risk models are mathematical

1016
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,320
representations of systems

1017
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,720
on that side of it that's there

1018
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,960
the problem is that

1019
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,599
we do simple math we have skipped it

1020
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,480
down to as you can see the impact and

1021
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,720
likelihood hey here it is here's our

1022
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,359
little matrix and look we have different

1023
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,839
levels and everything else that's there

1024
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:18,640
so

1025
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,000
here's the impact and here's the

1026
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,200
likelihood

1027
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,760
so how many people have heard that it's

1028
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,720
like it's not if but when

1029
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,480
you get breached

1030
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,280
and you've told that to ceos

1031
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,119
multiple times awards multiple times or

1032
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,000
other manages multiple times

1033
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,560
so you just took the likelihood and

1034
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,599
skewed it

1035
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,040
it's done

1036
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,200
likelihood is very likely

1037
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,560
scroll

1038
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,640
okay my my matrix now is just a bar

1039
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,040
chart that's all based upon impact well

1040
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,440
that makes no risk decisions based on

1041
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,960
impact you can

1042
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,200
hey this is critical but where is it

1043
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,240
actually at

1044
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,920
but what if i have controls around

1045
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,839
zero

1046
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:06,160
day du jour whatever this week is for

1047
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,720
microsoft or

1048
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,800
f5 or pulse secure fortinet whatever it

1049
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,480
is there's one out there that's been

1050
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,079
released multiple

1051
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,359
that's there

1052
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:20,720
are there any mitigations that are being

1053
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,680
used

1054
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,359
because that

1055
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:25,040
changes

1056
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,359
that portion

1057
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:28,560
of that

1058
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,680
what's the value of that asset

1059
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,640
hey if we burn this cloud infrastructure

1060
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,960
down we lose all our data

1061
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,760
that is a lot of stuff that will

1062
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,920
not be done that is a hundred million

1063
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,119
dollars

1064
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,040
gone

1065
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,119
that's there

1066
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,880
so there's a value that's associated

1067
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,880
with the stuff that often is not looked

1068
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,160
at

1069
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,640
that's there and so there's pluses and

1070
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,640
minuses behind it that we've forgotten

1071
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,440
about

1072
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,480
but they're part of your toolkit it's

1073
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,640
kind of like you know i'm still using

1074
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,320
the hammer and the screwdriver and

1075
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,320
that's my only tools and it's like yeah

1076
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,760
you have sockets and pliers and all

1077
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,599
these other things but i like the hammer

1078
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,359
and i like the screwdriver

1079
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:13,119
it's like that's good you're comfortable

1080
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,520
with it step away

1081
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,160
from those and pick up some neutrals

1082
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,839
because it's the key

1083
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,160
now one of the things about wrist

1084
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,400
that's there and i'll show some slides

1085
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,760
that developed is like

1086
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,720
visual is the key because i'm taking

1087
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,000
risks which is a really complicated

1088
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,480
understanding for mathematical functions

1089
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,200
that are there and i'm trying to talk to

1090
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,880
business leaders

1091
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,680
about it so we try to simplify it as

1092
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,079
much as possible but i think we try to

1093
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,400
simplify it too much we should have

1094
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,160
tried to visualize it as much as

1095
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,440
possible

1096
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,520
because visualization sometimes makes it

1097
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,920
simpler for them to understand what is

1098
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,599
actually occurring

1099
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,720
that's there versus hey this is 2.6 and

1100
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,959
we move from 2.6 to 2.3

1101
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,520
that's good right the lower is better or

1102
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,640
is up more better which one is it

1103
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,760
we miss kind of the boats that are there

1104
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,160
and we do a lot of extra work to not get

1105
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,640
the outcome that we want

1106
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,640
or be able to display

1107
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,960
in some of those

1108
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,280
so one of the areas here's

1109
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,800
some areas that

1110
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,359
we'll go through it's like pick four

1111
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,599
major categories and this could be for

1112
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,520
any manufacturing organization it's like

1113
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,760
hey brand damage really really bad here

1114
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,280
are things that we

1115
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,880
want to look at these may be in your

1116
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,200
risk register these may be questions

1117
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,800
that the board is asking you these may

1118
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,960
be questions that the ceo is asking your

1119
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,680
cfo any of the people along those lines

1120
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,079
of hey what about third party suppliers

1121
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,040
what about if they steal privacy data

1122
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,800
intellectual property

1123
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,119
software supply chain all those things

1124
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,119
fall in there

1125
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,960
and what's in red

1126
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,359
those are important but i don't have the

1127
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,880
budget or staff to do this

1128
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,960
so i'm telling you ahead of time those

1129
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,520
are important and they're ready

1130
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,319
not going to worry about them

1131
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,160
it's a good discussion competitive kind

1132
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,800
of like an icebreaker but

1133
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,200
they now understand that

1134
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,839
now everybody's data is more important

1135
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:27,440
than our employees

1136
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,119
i tell you that's the same for every

1137
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,880
organization but no one will put it in

1138
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,240
writing

1139
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,920
but that's one of the key things that's

1140
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,760
part of that same with supply chain

1141
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,480
disruption sales disruption

1142
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,960
business processes disruption

1143
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,720
and then we use the same

1144
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,319
matrix

1145
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,640
risk and likelihood

1146
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,800
and we plot the little colors

1147
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,400
on the chart and says

1148
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,240
now you know where things sit

1149
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,560
my risk ratings and everything else are

1150
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,000
there

1151
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,440
they sit

1152
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,280
hey here's my high residential risk

1153
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,720
here's my low risk you want to be in the

1154
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,119
lower quadrant it's a gartner quadrant

1155
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,280
or something

1156
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,760
i'm doing here okay there you go

1157
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,440
okay

1158
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,880
i'm gonna wait and see what you're doing

1159
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,319
for my laptop

1160
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,359
turn up on my port ah so you have it on

1161
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:19,119
to the left side of it and says hey

1162
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,680
here's where bubbles are

1163
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,599
here's where my risks are associated

1164
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:27,200
with those scenarios that are there

1165
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,079
the second chart is here's how i root

1166
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:34,400
from my 2020 risk to my 2021 risk here's

1167
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,040
what's actually occurred some risk got

1168
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,480
more

1169
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,839
some risk got lower because i had a

1170
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,160
program i did something about it we

1171
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,480
changed the way we do business

1172
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,960
things changed on that so i lowered some

1173
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,240
of my risk

1174
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,400
other things naturally

1175
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,240
got worse

1176
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,640
and they do it's no fault of your own

1177
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,800
you didn't do anything

1178
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,880
you did not do something but you didn't

1179
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,000
do anything and it just got worse

1180
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,640
and if internet is like that things will

1181
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,079
go hey we we still decided that we think

1182
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,160
exchange is like the greatest email

1183
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,079
system in the world so we decided we're

1184
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:16,720
still sticking with on-prem exchange i

1185
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,560
think that would have been changed this

1186
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,119
year but those are things that you run

1187
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,920
into that get sucked back in but

1188
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,560
in a visualization side of it everybody

1189
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,119
in the room gets the chart on the right

1190
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,880
immediately

1191
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,079
it's there you can use a a circle or a

1192
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,920
line that says here is our risk

1193
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,000
acceptance threshold

1194
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,839
that's there we're trying to bring

1195
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:42,000
everything that's on the outside of that

1196
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,400
to the inside

1197
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,160
maybe that's your full things that

1198
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,920
you're targeted is everything that's on

1199
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,760
the outside because it's not acceptable

1200
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,200
we want to bring it in

1201
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,359
that's there maybe you're driven by your

1202
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:54,800
supply chain maybe you're driven by

1203
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,240
business maybe you're driven by your

1204
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,040
third parties and partnerships

1205
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,839
maybe driven by vc funds guess what all

1206
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,720
those things pull into that equation but

1207
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,599
the visualization of it is what you're

1208
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,839
trying to get your point across

1209
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:11,760
it doesn't matter what kind of matter

1210
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,839
you use where it's at

1211
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:16,640
but the visualization to tell people

1212
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,200
here's what when we've done

1213
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,960
here's how we did it

1214
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,040
that's there and it's aligned to a

1215
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,599
project a person more priority and

1216
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:26,960
technology

1217
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,920
you can

1218
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,119
find that and do a story with each one

1219
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:32,560
of these

1220
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,359
and communicate that story

1221
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:37,359
that's there and it doesn't have to be a

1222
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:39,760
risk conversation

1223
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,680
and i think that is the key

1224
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,480
that our visualization of risk is still

1225
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,880
an excel spreadsheet

1226
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,280
and that's a problem

1227
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,880
doesn't mean that you don't use an excel

1228
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,960
spreadsheet to create it

1229
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,560
but that's not what i'm going to present

1230
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,960
to people that are outside my area of

1231
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,079
focus

1232
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,760
because now i have to explain everything

1233
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,880
to them

1234
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,640
what is this ts the

1235
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,599
tls and cypher suite stuff that you're

1236
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:08,240
replacing on all the web servers that

1237
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,440
are there

1238
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,200
and then you're getting into it like oh

1239
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,560
no it's kind of like when you take a

1240
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,640
straw and you put it into a soda and sip

1241
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,800
that's the tunnel that's built and

1242
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,240
you're like you've done run down a

1243
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,480
raffle you're done

1244
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,000
you don't want to do that that's why i'm

1245
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,079
saying this they get simple

1246
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:25,440
straightforward here's what's changed

1247
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,359
here's what's getting worse

1248
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,280
let's talk about it because that's the

1249
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,280
conversation you want to have

1250
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,520
what are you going to do about it

1251
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,599
what do you think i should do about it

1252
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:36,880
because that would be the next

1253
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,160
conversation

1254
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,760
what are you doing about the ones that

1255
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,560
are moving into the room

1256
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,560
not what about this gray one that's over

1257
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,839
in the left hand corner

1258
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,760
always the hr department

1259
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,960
so

1260
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,960
one of the key things that i always look

1261
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:00,599
at and this has been done from that is

1262
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,319
where is it being driven from in

1263
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,880
decisions in the process on that and if

1264
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,640
you look at it from

1265
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,440
the staging of it

1266
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,800
every level you're away from your ceo

1267
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,240
that's another gating interference

1268
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,319
communication effort even if you have

1269
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:19,839
direct communication that you could send

1270
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,079
to the ceo everything else it's about

1271
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,480
how the information is gathered up and

1272
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,240
not gathered up and this is different in

1273
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,480
every organization but a lot of times

1274
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,119
hey if you if the

1275
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,160
i report

1276
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,800
cio and the cio reports the cfo and the

1277
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,160
cfo reports to the ceo

1278
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,720
so all my information that i give to the

1279
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,240
cio he gives half of that to the cfo and

1280
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,319
the cfo takes that and cuts it in half

1281
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:47,599
again to

1282
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:49,200
the other one

1283
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,200
when i first started doing board of

1284
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,760
director things i remember you had four

1285
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,000
slides you got through three and then

1286
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,920
you were allocated like a half an hour

1287
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,839
and they cut you to like 15 minutes and

1288
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,359
10 minutes

1289
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:03,200
they were there now you have a special

1290
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:07,119
event you're on for an hour and you have

1291
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:08,880
another whole day

1292
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,960
kind of scenarios in your life

1293
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,359
yeah thank you for coming wishes and

1294
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,599
dreams coming true here's the outcomes

1295
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,200
of that more work

1296
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,000
but

1297
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,720
hey you're able to get this and it is

1298
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,160
now moved up

1299
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,160
media has helped it's like everybody's

1300
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,680
concerned about it everybody wants to

1301
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,160
ask questions about it but everybody

1302
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,680
wants to ask questions and then it's one

1303
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,280
of the key areas that you have to be

1304
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,680
careful of

1305
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,800
so

1306
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,800
i don't want to say that ceos don't care

1307
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,040
about cyber security

1308
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,480
but it's not on their top kid it may be

1309
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,400
maybe in their top 10 like i'm concerned

1310
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,839
about it but they think someone else is

1311
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:48,240
handling it

1312
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,480
it's kind of like hey i'm concerned i

1313
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,319
won't be able to get employees hr is

1314
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,119
handling that problem

1315
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:56,720
i'm concerned that we're not going to be

1316
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,480
able to sell more products sales is

1317
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,319
taking care of that

1318
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,720
it is dissemination of that and you need

1319
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,839
to be ready for that because a lot of

1320
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:06,400
people

1321
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,200
five

1322
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,440
years ago ten years ago people were

1323
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,800
complaining that they didn't they

1324
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,920
weren't sitting at the table

1325
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,079
well when you sit at the table it comes

1326
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:18,319
with the responsibility of sitting at

1327
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:20,240
the table what are you bringing to the

1328
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,000
table

1329
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,079
that's the question they're going to ask

1330
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:25,280
and they're going to expect you to be

1331
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,200
able to answer

1332
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,680
and like hey we want to do this is this

1333
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,599
okay and you look at it well i think

1334
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,359
i'll let the business decide

1335
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:34,640
and they're going to look at you like

1336
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,000
you're here

1337
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,440
to decide

1338
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,920
you are the business as a part of this

1339
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,079
so you need to make a decision

1340
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:43,440
and you need to be ready for that

1341
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,119
because a lot of times that doesn't you

1342
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,599
are the point person you own it they

1343
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:49,119
expect you to own it they expect you to

1344
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,520
deliver for it and they expect you to to

1345
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,920
be accountable for it trying to

1346
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,800
shake it push it move it

1347
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,640
you're gonna get into

1348
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,359
bad situations across the board that's

1349
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:03,680
there

1350
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,599
you typically have to manage you have to

1351
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:07,440
manage expectations you have to manage

1352
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,960
deliverables you have to manage

1353
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,119
different things along the way and how

1354
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,160
you communicate that is also important

1355
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,440
that's there um

1356
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,160
you will own things that people hate

1357
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,280
shadow i.t is a perfect example of it i

1358
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,240
i take over shadow ip things

1359
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,520
why because they're unloved uncared for

1360
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,599
sitting on someone's desk and it's like

1361
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,480
this is really bad

1362
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,400
let me take over the responsibility for

1363
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,760
doing this

1364
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,319
and they're like thank you here

1365
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:42,960
but i'm thankful because now it gets

1366
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,640
patched it gets updates it gets fixed

1367
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,200
versus before it's staying there and

1368
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,280
it's not going to change

1369
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,800
it's been there for four years it's

1370
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,119
gonna stay there for another four years

1371
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,280
until the russians break in and hide on

1372
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,559
it in the lab environment to shift on

1373
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:01,280
that

1374
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,040
and that's there

1375
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,960
at some point you might even unpatch it

1376
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,440
i don't patch it for workstations

1377
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,040
simply due to the fact that that was

1378
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,160
like i'm tired of not patching stuff and

1379
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,760
they're like don't touch the servers and

1380
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,880
i was like fine we'll take over the

1381
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,480
workstations

1382
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,720
because they have a larger footprint

1383
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,480
we did this long before covid and

1384
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,920
everything else and it's really nice

1385
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,280
that we did

1386
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,520
because hey if we had to rely on you

1387
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,359
guys it would take forever

1388
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:30,000
to meet their sla which you may not need

1389
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,839
but now hey

1390
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:33,760
all the workstations all the attack

1391
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,319
surfaces are being greatly reduced

1392
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:38,240
in some of those cases you will own

1393
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,640
things that are that there be prepared

1394
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,040
for that because you're you will get

1395
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,440
asked on those sides and you will butt

1396
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,599
heads at those times

1397
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:50,240
and sometimes it's just like well fine

1398
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,680
you take it over

1399
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,960
you're like but i don't want to take it

1400
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,480
over that you complained about it and

1401
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,640
you complained last three meetings so

1402
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,800
it's now your responsibility

1403
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,160
but i don't

1404
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,000
you still do and right you have more

1405
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,160
people that are added to your team

1406
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,440
as part of that

1407
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,079
that's great but you will own what you

1408
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:08,880
don't

1409
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,800
complain about in a lot of times so just

1410
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,000
be prepared

1411
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,119
on that it is a mature process to go i

1412
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,400
own it great i'll make it better

1413
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,319
thank you

1414
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:22,800
don't oh i can't do this because

1415
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,119
immediately you down in the doubt

1416
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:26,720
oh you don't you want to complain about

1417
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,079
it but you don't want to take action on

1418
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,079
it we all know those people they all

1419
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,559
drive us crazy crazy in meetings on

1420
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,400
multiple times a day

1421
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,319
but yeah i'll complain and complain and

1422
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,240
complain but i'll never

1423
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,920
do anything about the planets one

1424
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,040
complaint

1425
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,400
that's great

1426
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,839
time waste

1427
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:46,400
on that so when they give you something

1428
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,800
take ownership make it better

1429
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,839
that's there

1430
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,399
um

1431
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,839
be prepared

1432
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:59,440
and i think this is just a maturity

1433
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,280
cycle it's there

1434
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,440
the second you turn over a rock you find

1435
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,520
bugs

1436
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,520
the second you

1437
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,440
look at a server a little closer or you

1438
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,760
five bucks second you do a vulnerability

1439
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,240
scan for ports and then you go onto the

1440
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,559
device and scan it you find a lot more

1441
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:17,440
stuff

1442
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,480
you're gonna find more things

1443
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,559
just be prepared it is like hey this is

1444
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,160
the tip of the iceberg and we're

1445
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,440
bringing

1446
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,960
everything down

1447
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,559
and it's gonna get bigger and bigger and

1448
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:30,880
bigger on that will work to get it done

1449
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,079
you have security debt you have

1450
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:33,920
technical debt you have i.t debt you

1451
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,920
have legacy debt you have all these debt

1452
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,599
things that no one wants to pay the bill

1453
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:38,400
for

1454
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,280
that you're going to have to do

1455
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,520
something with so figure out where it's

1456
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,480
there

1457
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,160
figure out your own ratings what's

1458
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,319
important what's not important what's

1459
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:48,270
your short list what's your long list

1460
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:49,440
[Music]

1461
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,640
it's there i always carry the list

1462
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,839
as a topic on that i carry a list if the

1463
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,640
business said hey you need to cut

1464
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,359
everything by 25 what would you do

1465
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:02,400
there you go

1466
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,720
everybody in supply chain organizations

1467
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,240
has those lists you should too

1468
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:12,240
also if they say here's another check

1469
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,480
how much do you need well here's my

1470
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,720
current list wish

1471
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,119
me less not this

1472
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:20,160
on there

1473
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,160
already done

1474
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,160
here give it to cfo did you write me a

1475
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,359
check today

1476
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:27,040
bitcoin actually

1477
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,200
um no i think that's one of the key

1478
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,079
things

1479
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:31,280
but

1480
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,040
you need to figure out how you're

1481
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,359
stacking stuff how priorities are

1482
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,400
generated

1483
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,880
because you can do it by dollars you can

1484
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,559
do it 110

1485
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,010
but standardize on something

1486
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,359
[Music]

1487
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:45,760
and keep it for more than a year

1488
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,440
because if you go hey this is working

1489
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,079
good we're we're the consumer reports

1490
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:51,440
little dials

1491
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,800
and everything else

1492
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,119
25 done half done 75 time complete

1493
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,839
uh it's fine just make sure you keep it

1494
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:02,559
and that's what's being shown

1495
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:05,680
if you change too much people now don't

1496
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,880
understand make it visual so they can

1497
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,920
simply understand that colors are great

1498
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,599
this is why you have blackjack charts

1499
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:16,400
hey red i know that's bad

1500
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,760
green's good red's bad yellow is okay

1501
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,559
so

1502
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:22,400
hey people will understand that that's

1503
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,400
why they're kind of sucked into that

1504
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,480
doesn't mean you use it

1505
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,079
because once somebody figures it out

1506
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:31,119
it's easy but you need to standardize on

1507
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:33,280
it and keep it because otherwise it's

1508
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,400
there you also need to do some things of

1509
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,280
hey here's my stack of stuff

1510
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,520
that we want to do

1511
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,359
what's the minimum what's the maximum

1512
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:45,920
what's the average is it all horrible

1513
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,960
and high risk is it somewhat there maybe

1514
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,760
a little bit less where does it sit and

1515
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,359
what's the plan

1516
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:54,799
that's there

1517
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:55,680
um

1518
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,079
note to self any global organizations do

1519
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:01,040
not use a through f

1520
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,760
that is a very very us-centric breaking

1521
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,280
system

1522
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,119
didn't figure that out until i used it

1523
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:09,040
and then i had half of my people

1524
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,440
overseas going what is it

1525
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,640
is that good

1526
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,920
and i was like i was like uh

1527
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,839
that's like what we get in school oh we

1528
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:21,359
get ones and i'm like oh okay sorry

1529
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,880
something that you thought was simple

1530
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,760
doesn't always get in the other thing

1531
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,160
share things openly before the final

1532
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,079
product goes out

1533
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:32,720
in a lot of cases it will save yourself

1534
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,880
from making assumptions on that that's

1535
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,640
there you need to figure out your own

1536
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,400
schedule where it will be dictated to

1537
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,160
you

1538
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:43,280
and if you're like hey we're completely

1539
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,720
fully

1540
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,839
utilized until

1541
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:48,640
november

1542
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,000
that's there

1543
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,440
but you need to show that you're fully

1544
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,079
utilized don't make it up and like i

1545
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:56,319
don't want to work on november

1546
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:58,799
that's there because you will be called

1547
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:01,040
to that and you will be told that no

1548
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,720
this needs to be done you need to

1549
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,520
re-prioritize so always be able to pick

1550
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,680
something up and move it

1551
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,440
that's there if you can't pick it up and

1552
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,480
move it

1553
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,559
do do other things you everybody needs

1554
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:13,680
to know that

1555
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,839
oh we have consultants on site we have

1556
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,680
this this is going to be two weeks we

1557
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,440
can't do it here

1558
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,200
don't commit to it

1559
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,680
and not do it because that just gets you

1560
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,960
in hot water

1561
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,160
somebody's watching you and will

1562
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,680
determine that and i think that's one of

1563
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,280
the key things you really have to be

1564
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,440
there

1565
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,359
if it's really broken

1566
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:39,280
is it worth fixing

1567
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,240
that's an assumption

1568
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:44,880
it's not stupid i mean it's done it's

1569
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,200
legacy it's not and you'll find those

1570
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,280
things oh this just takes this invoice

1571
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,720
and emails it

1572
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,720
to this company um

1573
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,559
don't we have a whole system that does

1574
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:56,720
this in finance yes

1575
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,720
well why can't we

1576
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,480
use this now well this is the way this

1577
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,799
was our first vendor that we set up and

1578
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:04,400
this is just the way it works so you're

1579
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,359
like

1580
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:06,799
get rid of it

1581
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:08,079
stop it

1582
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:10,480
it's there

1583
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,280
so

1584
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,280
be aware that things that are bad broken

1585
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,680
in legacy always ask the question should

1586
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,640
i fix it or should i

1587
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,400
kill it

1588
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,680
get rid of it

1589
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,000
because sometimes people try to fix

1590
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,799
things that should build

1591
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:29,440
unfortunately hey this just doesn't work

1592
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,079
it never worked really well just move

1593
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:33,920
on from that

1594
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,000
that's there

1595
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
um

1596
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,359
it's all fun

1597
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:43,440
until someone gets hurt and the reason i

1598
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,000
say that is most businesses that define

1599
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,160
what they call critical risk and their

1600
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,640
policies and controls standards that are

1601
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,520
there

1602
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,720
that are there and they're typically

1603
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,559
around like three areas

1604
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:55,920
unfortunately

1605
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,079
this is not my thing one

1606
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:00,480
that two people have to die not just one

1607
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,799
person two people have to die from some

1608
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:04,720
defect or something that's actually

1609
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:05,760
there

1610
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,160
uh that's part of that there's always

1611
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,240
dollars that are lost in sales there's

1612
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,559
always dollars that are lost in revenue

1613
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:15,680
and that's usually it

1614
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,760
there's no cyber security there's no

1615
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,240
ransomware there's no anything else

1616
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:24,160
that's human life and money

1617
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,319
because again that's usually private

1618
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:28,319
business

1619
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:30,720
there may be others and organizations

1620
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,319
different verticals different things

1621
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:34,960
that are there but it's always there

1622
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,799
the term material risk is also important

1623
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:41,280
use it incorrectly the lawyer in the

1624
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,400
room

1625
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,960
will laugh at you

1626
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,520
and maybe correct you or may not say

1627
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,799
anything

1628
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:50,960
on that material risk is typically some

1629
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,599
percentage of your total revenue targets

1630
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:55,440
that are actually there so the more

1631
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,920
money you make the larger

1632
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:58,720
your

1633
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,000
revenue

1634
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,680
is therefore the larger risk acceptance

1635
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,000
they are willing to take or what is

1636
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,480
material that would impact

1637
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,040
the revenue stream now becomes critical

1638
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,599
and that can be huge

1639
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:15,280
that's there

1640
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,359
and if that's huge

1641
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:19,920
you have an issue

1642
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,040
because if i define my risk as like hey

1643
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,520
this could cost a million dollars

1644
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,599
and that is not a material loss for an

1645
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:29,359
organization

1646
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:32,000
guess what

1647
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,079
if a million dollars is not enough for

1648
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:35,760
you

1649
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,839
what is 50 000

1650
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:40,079
what is 100 000

1651
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:41,920
so you really have to be careful on that

1652
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,839
side of it what is the material risk for

1653
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:46,640
your organization willing to accept

1654
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:49,119
is it three percent of your revenue five

1655
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,559
ten

1656
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:52,000
that's there you're a public traded

1657
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,160
company

1658
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,040
not

1659
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,720
all those are questions that there and

1660
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,480
then you get into third party and fourth

1661
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,319
party risk they're associated with your

1662
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:03,440
side of it you're also into

1663
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,400
am i doing assessment questionnaires is

1664
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,520
it human interaction or just electronic

1665
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,359
how are things being structured and

1666
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:13,680
moved along in a lot of cases that are

1667
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,680
there and then who are the players what

1668
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,920
are the audits where do they go

1669
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:21,599
um that's there is there a winner

1670
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:24,640
talking about rest there is not a winner

1671
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,880
it's kind of like the casino

1672
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,200
house wins 50 of the time or a little

1673
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,680
more than 50 of the time

1674
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:34,559
so you take your winnings and walk away

1675
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:37,920
before they steal them back

1676
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,839
if you're trying to understand risk you

1677
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:43,599
have to understand your audience who's

1678
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:46,319
talking to where they act that

1679
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:48,480
visualization is key

1680
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,319
you also need to get buy-in and the

1681
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:52,720
issues have those conversations where i

1682
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,280
reach out to someone communicate with

1683
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,760
them and get them to agree with me

1684
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,599
this is bad

1685
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:02,000
like i said it's hard talking to

1686
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,920
children in some cases

1687
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,839
yes you agree that this is bad and we

1688
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:07,359
don't want to do this we don't want to

1689
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:09,200
lose intellectual property to the

1690
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,480
nearest competitor no we don't okay now

1691
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,400
that you agree and get consensus on it

1692
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,960
you can move and step forward it's like

1693
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,640
a conversation

1694
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,240
going up the stairs

1695
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,799
and i think that's super incredible and

1696
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:24,799
you need to do that on that

1697
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:26,480
uh you can use your competitors with

1698
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,160
what they find

1699
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,319
for your community must must your

1700
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:33,839
competitors see someone talk to you

1701
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:35,680
and actually a lot of good friends on

1702
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:36,880
that side of it and they have

1703
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,720
conversations and you can talk to them

1704
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,920
that's there

1705
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,920
same thing goes for standards best

1706
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,079
practices who's best practices that are

1707
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:45,280
part of that

1708
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,040
and that what is important to you what's

1709
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,280
not it's not trade secrets

1710
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,559
it's sharing

1711
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:53,839
of that and we all get better when you

1712
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:56,240
share this kind of information

1713
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:59,359
uh that's part of that

1714
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,280
when you do risk

1715
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,119
there's things you can do with it you

1716
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:07,039
can try to defend it

1717
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:08,720
you can try to transfer it you can

1718
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,440
mitigate it or you can accept it or you

1719
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:12,880
can get rid of it

1720
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,400
erase it

1721
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,799
each of those has a good thing

1722
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:20,319
and a bad thing

1723
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:22,720
and it's one of those things it's it's

1724
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,880
there there's not a good and bad each

1725
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,160
situation is going to be different i

1726
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,160
wish i could tell you 10 of these are

1727
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,920
going to be defend

1728
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,000
40 are going to be transferred

1729
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,799
the rest are mitigation or

1730
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:37,520
one percent is going to be acceptance 50

1731
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,119
is probably closer to the real

1732
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:42,000
acceptance level just be aware

1733
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,520
different organizations have that risk

1734
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:47,559
appetite that's there

1735
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,160

security is about doing

1752
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:27,280
it's not about

1753
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,680
talking about it it's about

1754
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:33,039
doing it and we all have to do it that's

1755
