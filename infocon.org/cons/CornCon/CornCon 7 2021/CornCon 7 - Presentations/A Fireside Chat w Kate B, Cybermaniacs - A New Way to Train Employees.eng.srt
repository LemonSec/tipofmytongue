00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,239
professionals

28
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,359
that is a charity event to help an

29
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,320
organization called childline

30
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,959
which is a hotline that children can

help

33
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,840

34
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,880
together

35
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,280
and raises hundreds of thousands of

36
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,159
pounds for this awesome organization and

37
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,640
kate's company was one of the sponsors

38
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,799
and it was the first time i'd seen cyber

39
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,159
education

40
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,439
in presented in a format like this and i

41
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,439
fell in love with the company

42
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,280
i'm uh i'm not gonna steal any thunder

43
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,360
what the format is because it's pretty

44
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,799
rock star

45
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,479

80
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,960
like this

81
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,320

to any company the way i saw a reaction

92
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,320

introduced myself and said i'd really

94
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,440
like to be a part of your journey and

95

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,759
if you help me a little bit

97
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,639
and with that i'd like to introduce kate

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,400
thanks kate

99
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,080
the two kids

100
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,280
fireside chat

101
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,639
so why don't you tell a little bit about

102
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,560
yourself

103
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,160
so i'm a gemini and um

104
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,479
you like ron walks on walks on the page

105
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,360
uh no so so i spent most of my career um

106
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,360
before i came to cyber security about

107
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,280
three or four years ago i was enterprise

108
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,080
i.t

109
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,240
so the beginning of it was you know

110
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,800
doing sales um just stanford gartner

111
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,360
unfortunately just kidding

112
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,639
um and

113
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,319
a lot of what i was focused on is

114
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,400
helping companies actually implement the

115
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,880
change that the technology seemed to

116
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,280
provide and so i've spent you know 20

117
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,039
years at the coal face trying to get

118
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,560
pesky humans to actually adopt what we

119
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,319
were developing whether that was a

120
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,080
regulation we had to roll out whether

121
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,479
that was an application that we had

122
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,639
built in-house whether that was a new

123
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,560
vendor platform we were migrating to so

124
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,960
i spent you know 20 years working inside

125
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,120
of companies and in the vendor space

126
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,680
trying to actually help the companies

127
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,840
adopt to technology

128
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,840
and it was incredibly difficult and i

129
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,840
guess i just kept on asking the question

130
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,840
well why why why is it so hard for

131
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,080
humans to to do this or why is it so um

132
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,680
challenging to communicate or what can

133
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,680
we do to make it better and that kind of

134
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,280
took me down a path of just learning

135
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,400
about

136
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,080
you know organizational culture and

137
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,720
agile and all these other things and i

138
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,720
think what came together with cyber

139
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,639
maniacs is i actually have a theater

140
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,000
degree

141
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,800
and my parents are so proud right now

142
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,199
that i'm actually using it for the first

143
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,199
time in 25 years they're like

144
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,800
why are you getting a theater degree i

145
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,400
was like i don't know because i like the

146
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,319
human condition and shakespeare is

147
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,919
fascinating and this is interesting but

148
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,120
then i got pulled into this world of

149
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,680
technology because it was fascinating to

150
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,319
see what the potential was of all this

151
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,919
new technology that's out there and so i

152
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,599
guess that's just the beginning of the

153
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,440
story which is i do have a creative

154
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,120
background but i also have been actually

155
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,759
part of it change for 20 years and three

156
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,680
years ago we came up with this crazy

157
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,400
idea so let's talk about it let's talk

158
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
about this crazy idea so

159
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,560
as a former practitioner i will agree

160
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,440
that getting your staff to actually look

161
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,360
at cyber education

162
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,440
and get through the checks in the boxes

163
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,160
is is a painful experience

164
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,240
and sometimes the videos and the

165
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,960
compliance and the the security

166
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,319
education is is a bit dry

167
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,919
what is a cyber maniac how did this all

168
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,440
come about

169
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,160
well i think what we started with was

170
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,840
we actually started with questions

171
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,120
around

172
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,080
people

173
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,039
and attention and culture like that's

174
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,719
what the first cup of coffee we had when

175
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,799
we talked about what could we do how

176
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,799
could we do it that led us down this

177
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,080
path was

178
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,000
you know you go to cyber security

179
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,599
conferences a lot i think it's getting

180
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,958
better in the last couple of years and

181
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,560
certainly with rsa last year there's a

182
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,160
lot of talks around culture and how do

183
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,000
you use it how do you understand it but

184
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,800
this is you know five years ago and

185
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,320
there was a lot around don't forget

186
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,240
people you know you have to train your

187
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,519
people their most important thing and

188
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,120
culture is key and that would be the

189
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,800
last slide and then the presenter would

190
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,959
walk out the door with no information

191
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,279
about what it is or how you use it or

192
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,880
what does it mean or how do you measure

193
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,000
it and i think that's what we started

194
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,399
with which is we knew that was key to

195
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,800
any organizational change we had ever

196
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,399
done whether that was a regulatory

197
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,160
change or an i.t update or whatever it

198
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,560
was if you don't tap into the people

199
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,399
they will resist you what is it what's

200
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,480
the famous quote you know culture eats

201
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,480
strategy for breakfast yep cultivate

202
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,480
strategy for breakfast so we knew we had

203
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,240
to work with it and we were trying to

204
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,839
find better ways to do that but i think

205
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,839
the creative just came in because we

206
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:30,640
said

207
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,680
you know

208
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,360
employees are bored

209
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,959
and i've been in the corporate world

210
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,880
enough to know what bad

211
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,399
training looks like

212
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,200
and

213
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,279
i think that it's just a question of

214
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,120
when the technology was first i'll give

215
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,560
the quick version the quick version is

216
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,440
when lms's first came out and there was

217
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,320
an ability to deliver tons of learning

218
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,800
at scale to your whole workforce for

219
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,360
like less than 25 cents people were

220
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,640
really excited about that and they were

221
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,240
like great let's throw everything into

222
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,760
structured learning and lms we can just

223
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,680
deliver it to everybody digitally

224
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,000
and that's not necessarily getting the

225
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
right outcomes because the outcomes

226
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,519
we're actually looking for and this was

227
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,200
part of the first conversation is i

228
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,800
don't want people to be able to define

229
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,279
malware that's not my goal

230
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,279
that's like third grade right if you can

231
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,959
pick out malware from a multiple choice

232
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,399
thing and you can give me the definition

233
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,320
i haven't actually made you more

234
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,360
cybersecure as a human being and so we

235
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,800
kind of started to think about what

236
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,240
should we do how should we do at the

237
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,760
beginning

238
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,440
that is

239
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,760
more about the people and how do we help

240
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,000
them change instead of how do we just

241
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,399
get a tick box so i love the phrase and

242
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,560
i've heard you say it many many times

243
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,800
and we've talked about this is this

244
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,120
concept of beyond awareness

245
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,040
you were talking about it that you know

246
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,560
it's it's one thing to get to the third

247
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,959
grade level of this is malware

248
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,920
ransomware is a type of malware

249
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,839
ransomware is bad it will cost you money

250
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,959
you know to actually becoming a cultural

251
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,959
part of the business as far as

252
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,720
understanding and the awareness that's

253
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,880
necessary for making companies more

254
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,040
secure and right now in today's world

255
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,120
and i talked about yesterday in my talk

256
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,120
with the rise in cyber crime and the

257
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,040
types of cyber crime it's becoming

258
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,079
critical that companies make security

259
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,760
part of the culture

260
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,920
so talk to me about beyond awareness and

261
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,160
if you've got an example i'd love to

262
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,079
show an example of

263
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,480
you know one of your shorts

264
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,760
yeah so it's an interesting thing that

265
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,640
that

266
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,480
when i

267
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,000
when you're a vendor i guess you could

268
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,360
say and you're trying to sell into a

269
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,480
market and you're trying to sell

270
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,160
something that has a name you're like

271
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,519
well this is part of your budget and

272
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,800
that's the line item and this is what

273
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,320
i'm selling but i have a hard time

274
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,480
calling what we do awareness because i

275
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,480
don't think awareness is

276
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,399
what we're aiming at we may be in the

277
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,399
beginning it was and maybe i think it

278
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,600
came from

279
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,639
you know the info sex community to

280
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,959
this really amazing altruistic need to

281
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,120
tell other people what we know

282
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,560
right everybody in this room knows what

283
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,839
we're up against

284
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,440
and we want to share that information

285
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,959
with other people and i think that's the

286
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,240
beginning of it so it's like let me tell

287
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,160
you about malware let me teach you how

288
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,680
to protect your computer this stuff is

289
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,600
really important but the trick is is

290
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,920
that making someone aware through just

291
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,399
disseminating information doesn't

292
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,880
necessarily make them care

293
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,399
and that's the next level and like

294
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,240
that's where we're trying to get to

295
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,000
saying sort of my beyond thunderdome

296
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,279
moment where i'm saying i want to get

297
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,959
your employees to care

298
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,040
about their cyber security i want to get

299
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,519
them to care enough to either do the

300
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,240
right thing or ask the right people if

301
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,399
they have a question so how do we

302
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,399
develop trust how do we develop

303
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,959
dare i say good feelings about cyber

304
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,200
security and sometimes i'm sort of like

305
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,040
you know in a room of network analysts

306
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,360
i'm like can we talk about our feelings

307
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,040
and how your employees feel and what

308
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,480
they think and know

309
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,360
about cyber security about technology

310
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,519
change and about how policies and

311
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,279
procedures work at your organization and

312
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,600
that's that's beyond awareness is

313
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,440
getting them to care and then hopefully

314
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,120
being able to measure that i don't even

315
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,720
like talking about my feelings it must

316
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,120
be an interesting conversation

317
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,880
okay why don't we show a short and then

318
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,639
i want to talk about

319
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,200
how do you create change using

320
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,440
your platform

321
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,839
this is one of my favorites

322
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:39,109
[Music]

323
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,959
technical difficulties

324
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,839
oh we're being ashamed we're being held

325
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,000
out guys

326
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:52,080
[Music]

327
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,880
tim can you tell me does it go if it's

328
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,439
full screen yeah

329
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,480
so

330
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,720
this is where you'll be sitting one tech

331
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,120
with us who should lock it what's your

332
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,760
password and i don't know it's your

333
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,680
security question well that's what i

334
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,680
want to find out i just told you who

335
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,320
should log in what's your password and i

336
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,959
don't know it's your security question

337
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,320
are you the systems

338
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,120
yes are you also my id department yes

339
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,320
and you don't know

340
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,720
of course i do but then who's the

341
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,760
walking kid no i mean the fellow's name

342
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,639
who what the logic for this computer who

343
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,600
but the person that sits in this chair

344
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,000
the person that is in the queue who's

345
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,320
looking what are you asking me for

346
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,839
that's the bad

347
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,570
[Applause]

348
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,600
okay so

349
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,920
we're going beyond awareness we're

350
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,680
creating change

351
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,480
how does this impact an organization how

352
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,880
do you how do you take what we just saw

353
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,760
the awesome parody of who's on first

354
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,399
and make this applicable what what

355
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,160
what's that journey look like

356
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,320
so i think there's a couple things that

357
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,720
that we have found that are i consider

358
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,399
to be linchpins like they're sort of

359
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,560
just touch point moments and and i think

360
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,480
there's three ways we could summarize it

361
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,399
first is culture

362
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,399
and understanding what you have because

363
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,079
you don't have a cyber security culture

364
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,160
you have an organizational culture and

365
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,920
you can influence it towards cyber

366
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,560
security and you can use the good parts

367
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,639
and the values and by understanding

368
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,160
where the weaknesses are you can start

369
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,399
to shore them up through other ways of

370
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,480
adjusting but it's not something that

371
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,800
you're imposing on people so that's

372
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,120
cultural change i think infosec is an

373
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,560
industry is just starting on that

374
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,480
journey about bringing in you know

375
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,959
organizational anthropologists which is

376
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,399
by the way one of the founding members

377
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,320
of my company right so we did start from

378
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,759
a different place i think the second

379
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,440
thing is about agile

380
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,560
and i always laugh because everyone's

381
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,759
like you can't do hyper drivel and

382
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,839
security i was like well you can do

383
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,000
agile and cyber awareness

384
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,160
right because how important is it to

385
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,600
like rapid release because we've been

386
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,279
talking about that quite a bit which is

387
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,800
how do we get

388
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,399
all this information

389
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,639
distilled down into these little nuggets

390
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,360
of top tips tricks things how do i

391
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,040
deliver to the right people at the right

392
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,639
time whether that's a nudge or just an

393
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,240
information bite

394
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,160
because a lot of them are affected in

395
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,079
their personal lives by things that are

396
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,079
happening out in the world so part of

397
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,680
our part of our mission is to get that

398
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,000
content out or make that content in a

399
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,079
super fast way so that we can deliver it

400
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,000
to our customers and they can

401
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,519
right get it into the right hands of the

402
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,040
employees so that their their employees

403
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,800
actually know what's going on so talk to

404
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
me about that because you talked at the

405
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,360
beginning about lms and the learning

406
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,759
platforms and how we all got really

407
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,079
excited when you could quickly and

408
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,559
rapidly deploy learning but it's really

409
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,439
dry

410
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,919
it's really hard and it's kind of

411
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:08,799
so

412
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,319
walk me through

413
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,720
how a company would leverage and use

414
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,880
cyber maniacs what does that look like

415
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,359
what what are the outcomes and how do

416
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,679
they utilize your organization in a

417
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,359
different manner what makes you so

418
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,480
different

419
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,919
i think we've got

420
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,079
a couple of different

421
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,720
ways that we approach and look at not

422
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,200
just creating content but delivering

423
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,919
content so that employees will absorb it

424
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,400
engage with it and it actually sticks so

425
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
part of it is absolutely creative factor

426
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,160
and the puppets are only about 10 of

427
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,200
what we do

428
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,240
i like to show them because they're

429
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,480
funny i say we're 10 buzzy

430
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,039
but there's actually a lot more behind

431
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,760
the curtain of social media pop culture

432
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,919
mashups tons of different approaches

433
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,160
some human stuff animation

434
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,160
interactives basically any digital

435
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,240
medium that we can use to actually

436
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,400
engage with your audience we've got the

437
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,880
whole bag of universe tricks in the back

438
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,640
but i think what we're trying to do is

439
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,400
to say and this is a hard conversation

440
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,240
just to be fully transparent this is a

441
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,080
conversation because as you guys well

442
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,000
know when you're trying to implement

443
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,760
either new technology or a new way of

444
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,840
delivering something into what an

445
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,600
enterprise has is this established

446
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,760
technology stack there's always going to

447
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,760
be friction which is i'm sorry we need

448
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,919
you to put our stuff on an lms and my

449
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,600
answer is i'm really sorry but i can't

450
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,520
keep it all in the newt which is

451
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,919
critical to cyber security education if

452
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,760
you want to buy a phishing video and

453
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,880
play it for the next four years

454
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,400
which is the conversations we had in the

455
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,480
beginning which is like large financial

456
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,160
institutions or like we just like to buy

457
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,080
one training video and license it for

458
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,000
four years and i was like i really need

459
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,080
the money as a startup but

460
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,760
that's not really gonna

461
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,000
achieve the aims you think it's going to

462
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,919
right and so that was that was a hard

463
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,280
thing for me just being like i can't

464
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,880
believe i'm turning down business but

465
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,960
i'm

466
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,400
and so i think what we're looking at is

467
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,799
new ways of delivering micro content you

468
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,880
know there are ways to engage in

469
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,840
continuous learning um we're focused on

470
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,880
content and micro learning and

471
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,039
providing a way through the content for

472
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,320
different types of learners and

473
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,480
different types of personalities and we

474
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,039
actually do more autonomous learning

475
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,880
than we do structured and i think that's

476
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,480
the biggest change that we found so we

477
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,600
did like a long time itself um in a long

478
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,720
time

479
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,320
making sure that the notes we were

480
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,000
hitting like a band playing together

481
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,760
were the right ones so that when we came

482
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,360
out we actually addressed the need in

483
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,280
the market and it was

484
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,320
exhausting but really good um and we had

485
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,480
we were lucky to find some really people

486
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,000
who believed in us and some csos were

487
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,240
like this is crazy but

488
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,160
i see where you're going with it and

489
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,520
let's let's

490
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,280
let's test it out let's let's have some

491
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,320
um

492
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,640
let's have some trials and so that's

493
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,960
what allowed us to learn fast so let's

494
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,520
talk about that test out and how they're

495
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,960
learning because

496
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,559
you know i just did some research with

497
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,400
451 research and

498
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,240
one of the things that really alarmed me

499
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,520
was

500
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,960
it's just about being published that

501
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,880
this past year

502
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,919
accidental breach and insider theft so

503
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,600
not the bad guys coming in from the

504
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,039
outside but things that were either

505
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,240
accidental

506
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,520
or that were

507
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,760
done by an employee on the inside

508
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,039
are now

509
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,320
greater

510
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,039
than the external so it's coming out

511
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,280
that 55 of all

512
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,480
breaches

513
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,400
or you know cyber accidents however you

514
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,400
want to put it but any type of thing

515
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,360
like that

516
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,559
is now greater than the external so when

517
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,480
you look at that in that perspective

518
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,559
cyber education

519
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,480
understanding what you should be doing

520
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,240
as an employee making it part of the

521
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,440
culture

522
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,720
is becoming more and more critical but

523
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,640
it's hard to measure

524
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,120
and so you know putting on my hat as a

525
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,400
board number

526
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,320
you know one of the things that i'm

527
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,760
always looking at when we're looking at

528
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,440
risk registers with the company i'm

529
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,240
bored of is how do you actually measure

530
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,360
success

531
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,320
so

532
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,480
if i were looking at evaluating

533
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,880
cybermaniacs how would you

534
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,039
address my question of what does success

535
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,600
look like and how are we measuring it

536
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,200
so it's interesting i think that was one

537
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,600
of the things that

538
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,440
caught our attention and we really had

539
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,679
to doodle on in the beginning because

540
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,200
having been in

541
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,440
employee change programs having had to

542
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,320
roll out sharepoint and train people and

543
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,520
you know working with large

544
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,960
organizational stuff in the past i've

545
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,679
always seen where the where the

546
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,159
i guess static 10 question quiz that's

547
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,400
embedded into a compliant slide deck

548
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,480
doesn't actually teach you very much do

549
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,640
you know and i understand why auditors

550
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,000
need it and i understand the tech the

551
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,280
box and i think all that's great so

552
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,720
that's table stakes and that's built

553
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,919
into the program because we have to have

554
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,840
it right but i think what we looked at

555
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,760
was next which was well if i want to

556
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,039
change your humans you have to know who

557
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,200
your humans are and if you want to know

558
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,440
which humans are doing the dodgy things

559
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,120
there's many different things you can

560
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,880
look at to give you an answer to that so

561
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,400
i don't think the measures we do when we

562
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,159
have a lot and i'll talk about a sec is

563
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,760
the only measure you need to do around

564
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,679
your humans but if you're only looking

565
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,919
at keystrokes and packet level data that

566
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,880
doesn't answer why your humans are

567
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,320
having the problem and it could be

568
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,480
designed but it also could be

569
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,640
the way that they feel think or act

570
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,480
around technology so what are their

571
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,240
habits what are their beliefs about

572
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,480
technology what is the risk appetite you

573
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,159
might have different teams that have it

574
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,840
i mean we all know tech teams that like

575
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,919
to develop new things right the facebook

576
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,240
method of what is it go fast and break

577
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,080
 um

578
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,280
but then

579
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,159
stuff

580
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,280
and then but there's things

581
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,559
what's a couple of different angles we

582
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,320
can look at so we started with

583
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,159
we have to know what they know so we

584
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,240
have to start be able to measure at a

585
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,080
larger level what's their level of

586
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,240
general cyber digital know-how and then

587
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,520
what are they aware of what's their

588
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,120
level of currency so that's sort of the

589
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,200
beginning that we looked at but then we

590
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,200
started to bake in a lot of measurements

591
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,720
either through an assessment feature or

592
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,720
in the platform itself kind of like

593
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,559
canceling read a little breadcrumb trail

594
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,360
is

595
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,760
the i call them my feels and that's

596
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,240
sentiment and perception and we look at

597
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,480
that along a number of different vectors

598
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,679
and we built this with a marketing

599
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,400
scientist so we took the best of amazon

600
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,360
sales

601
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,000
and how they you know get you to buy

602
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,840
that extra widget at the end of the

603
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,320
shopping cart and we baked it into

604
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,000
why are your humans

605
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,720
afraid of technology how

606
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,320
likely do they think they will be a

607
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,840
victim of cyber crime because we all

608
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,360
know that some of those perceptions are

609
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,440
the ones that stop people taking

610
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,880
responsibility

611
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,960
for securing themselves and securing the

612
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,520
company right this is ig's job

613
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,799
right or

614
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,480
i have nothing hackers would want so how

615
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,000
do we start breaking those perceptions

616
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,840
if we don't know who has them and the

617
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,679
third thing we look at is we look at

618
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,600
organizational culture along like four

619
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,200
different dimensions including a

620
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,279
proprietary model we put together called

621
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,600
tribes because we think that we have

622
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,960
different groups within your

623
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,960
organization that have different digital

624
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,240
habits and it doesn't matter what

625
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,600
function they're in

626
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,840
right this is just about how they think

627
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,640
and feel and act with technology and how

628
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,400
you will communicate your policies and

629
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,559
then how you remediate them has to be

630
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,400
based on their values and so that's the

631
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,840
kind of granular level data we're

632
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,600
digging into and the thing that's been

633
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,520
exciting is the companies that have you

634
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,200
know helped us build this and put it

635
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,440
together the results have been super

636
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,600
surprising because

637
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,600
when you talk to people in a way that

638
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,960
they like

639
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,720
and you're reasonable with them and you

640
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,960
can strike the right emotional tone you

641
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,360
will get that personal change ten times

642
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,360
faster than a directive from the

643
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,760
governance board okay so

644
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,760
every time i have this conversation with

645
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,840
you the questions you have to ask you

646
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,279
get really excited

647
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,960
and then you go over my head on some of

648
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,679
the data points so before we do that i

649
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,840
want to talk about and i want to dig

650
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,799
more into not the creativity side but

651
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,960
the data that you're analyzing and i

652
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,039
know that you have been doing a lot of

653
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,520
research about what you should be

654
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,559
measuring

655
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,880
from a cyber education point of view and

656
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,559
also some of the research you've been

657
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,880
doing has some pretty surprising results

658
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,559
but i noticed that a lot of people have

659
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,039
walked in recently i'm wondering if we

660
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,799
have one more short we could play just

661
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,320
to give them a taste do you have another

662
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,000
one yes i can talk and search at the

663
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,080
same time okay why don't you just talk

664
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,600
and search at the same time so does

665
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,960
anyone want to see another one aren't

666
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,080
they fun they're so fun did you guys

667
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,760
understand why i got so excited when i

668
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,880
met her at this at in london yeah this

669
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,960
is a totally different type of company

670
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,320
we'll do another one unfortunately still

671
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,720
passwords but this one's fun

672
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,080
and this is not puppets this is just a

673
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,000
different style and it's a it's a super

674
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,840
serve but this is one of the um

675
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,678
social media style nudges that we do

676
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,490
[Laughter]

677
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:56,579
[Music]

678
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,320
so

679
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:14,199
[Applause]

680
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:24,289
[Applause]

681
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,919
so

682
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,320
hmm

683
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,120
so

684
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,160
[Laughter]

685
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,309
[Music]

686
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:26,349
[Applause]

687
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,770
awesome

688
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:36,480
[Applause]

689
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,799
so tell me about this research so the

690
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,120
research and

691
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,799
don't be super excited i am super

692
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,399
excited that's so funny i can't help it

693
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,919
i'm super excited so

694
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,440
some of the things that we've been

695
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,039
picking apart because as you know the

696
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,279
human the the human factors at an

697
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,960
organization and the people who make up

698
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,279
your workforce it's it's a it's a real

699
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,679
gordian knot and as we're kind of

700
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,120
pulling these threads apart we've been

701
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,960
trying to figure out the motivations the

702
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,480
behaviors and how all these things work

703
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,240
so one of the questions that we had

704
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,600
especially with this huge shift to

705
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,960
remote working that happened over the

706
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,480
last year was

707
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,120
are the people that we assume

708
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,039
follow the directives and

709
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,120
can absorb this new way of working the

710
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,799
same people we think like how how are we

711
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,880
keeping remote workers safe and you know

712
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,240
are they doing the things we think we're

713
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,919
doing because the more conversations we

714
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,000
have with csos and other people in the

715
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,720
industry the more we've been like this

716
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,960
is a whole level of we have no idea

717
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,799
what's going on in people's houses

718
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,559
like is the setup correct or how do we

719
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,159
guide them or how much kit do we give

720
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,840
them or how often do we give them

721
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,480
directives and do they have you know

722
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,480
alexas and series and listening devices

723
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,840
in the same room they're working and

724
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,600
what are the hr implications of

725
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,600
recording zoom calls and storing them on

726
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,399
your local drive as opposed to in the

727
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:49,679
same corporate cloud so there's just you

728
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:50,880
know there's like a plethora of

729
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,240
questions around this stuff and so we

730
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,840
said like well let's let's see what we

731
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,120
can start with and

732
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,880
some of our initial research which has

733
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,520
been super eye-opening is that we have

734
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,200
found that there's direct correlations

735
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,760
that the people that follow the rules in

736
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,960
your office

737
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,399
who you would say are your champions

738
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,480
your policy adherence the people you

739
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,840
don't have to worry about repeat

740
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,279
clicking all the time

741
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,559
you know it's sort of like you roll

742
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:13,840
something out and they're mostly on

743
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,120
board you're like thank you for that

744
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,919
right

745
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,679
they're actually not the people who are

746
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,320
more secure in a remote work environment

747
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,840
because what they want is the safety

748
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,480
security and structure of the office

749
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,799
and when they're in a remote location

750
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,240
and they're in their home

751
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,919
it's actually the people who usually

752
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,279
play a little fast and loose with the

753
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,600
rules who are statistically showing up

754
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,640
as being able to better adapt to the new

755
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,039
working environment and better run with

756
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,799
new regulations and so we're starting to

757
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,559
pull that out now not just on behaviors

758
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,279
but on individual types of cyber risk we

759
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,000
see

760
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,760
in remote working versus the office but

761
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,360
that was a big eye opener for us because

762
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,000
we assumed even we used to we're like uh

763
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,360
you know it's gonna show and then the

764
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,960
data came out we looked at correlations

765
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,320
but that's not the people we thought it

766
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,440
was

767
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,120
and that is that you know that's just

768
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,880
one example of some of the interesting

769
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,200
things we're finding so how you go about

770
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,200
communicating with the next and how we

771
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,039
do that dynamically and at speed is what

772
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,720
we're working on which is okay you've

773
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,919
got these kind of people what are the

774
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,600
right messages that i can send to them

775
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,159
and not make it a manual process but but

776
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,720
make it more automated and dynamic

777
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,720
so you're telling me in

778
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,880
addition to the work from home

779
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,880
technology shifts and transformation we

780
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,559
also need to transform

781
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,120
how we're educating our employees about

782
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,320
security

783
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,640
right well absolutely i mean look this

784
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,640
is if you go have a good chat with an

785
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,720
innovative hr executive they'll tell you

786
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,520
that

787
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,200
so much of the hr learning and

788
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,520
development space is shifting um you

789
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,840
know i used to make fun of hr until i

790
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,200
had to like jump to the trenches and

791
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,480
help them out and i think that they've

792
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,200
got

793
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,679
a yeoman service to do but sometimes in

794
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,600
many organizations it can be challenging

795
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,000
to to work together right and i think

796
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,880
that

797
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,960
this is one of the places where having a

798
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,760
great relationship with your hr team and

799
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,440
really digging in and understanding what

800
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,760
technologies are available and

801
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,000
you know getting beyond the lms as they

802
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,880
say it's super important because lms can

803
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,840
deliver

804
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,919
you know learning packages in five to 20

805
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,480
minutes but they are not dynamic that's

806
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,000
not what they were built for

807
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,159
so there are ways to

808
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,159
create streamed content there are ways

809
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,000
to create dynamic content there are ways

810
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
to personalize and segment for audiences

811
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,600
and i think that's the next frontier so

812
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,440
that is where we're going where it's

813
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,760
you know we are focusing more on how do

814
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,080
we create a personal journey of change

815
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,679
for each employee

816
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,080
and how do we find out their unique

817
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,279
desires

818
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,440
because i will tell you that the the

819
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,039
data that we're seeing from the platform

820
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,000
now is people are much more motivated

821
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,080
to learn about keeping their families

822
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,039
secure

823
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,360
then they are the company

824
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,919
but if i can teach them the same lessons

825
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,919
and they can absorb it into their person

826
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,840
then i'm creating happy cybersecure

827
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,080
people who will also keep your company

828
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,360
safe

829
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,720
okay so

830
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,600
let's pretend i'm a cisa

831
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,880
and i want to start making these changes

832
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,760
but this is a big shift in awareness

833
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,039
and

834
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:09,840
it's

835
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,760
we're used to the one-size-fits-all

836
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,600
training hat you know where we just go

837
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,519
into your point we deploy it with ml

838
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,480
alamos i can't say that now that nice

839
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,960
and it's kind of a one size fits all

840
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,640
how do they fight against it how do they

841
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,640
start working with you like what is your

842
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,200
normal typical engagement look like when

843
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,720
you start working with company and what

844
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,000
companies have you been working with

845
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,320
like what are the size and what what

846
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,440
have you looked at so we've got um

847
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,360
we have two ways that we've started to

848
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,039
work with organizations one is on a more

849
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,480
content basis

850
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,840
because they want to dip their toes in

851
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,200
the water and they realize that we've

852
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,519
got a creative secret sauce and

853
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,440
something that's different so usually we

854
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,880
start with that we say like look let's

855
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,480
deliver some videos let's deliver some

856
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,640
memes let's give you some nudges let's

857
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,640
engage with your workforce and once you

858
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,720
see the feedback on how much they love

859
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,799
this content then we dive in a bit more

860
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,320
but the other place that we usually

861
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,399
start is is with an assessment on the

862
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,320
people and so we come in and do a

863
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,640
comprehensive look at your population we

864
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,480
use our assessment framework to come in

865
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,360
and say here are your people really who

866
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,760
are your people why is that important

867
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,200
well how are you i mean this is the

868
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,640
thing is if you're going to design a

869
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,880
training program we're assuming that

870
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,720
everyone in the you know the law of

871
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,480
averages versus the law of the mean and

872
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,919
we kind of assume everyone knows this

873
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,840
much about passwords let's start here

874
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,000
but you might have 20 of your population

875
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,320
that doesn't lock their phone

876
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,559
right and we are able to help you find

877
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,200
how much of these populations exist what

878
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,799
they think feel and believe about cyber

879
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,320
security and how they fit into your

880
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,919
culture and we think that all those

881
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,080
things come together so that it's i call

882
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,720
it a map it's a culture map it's a sort

883
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,880
of a report on your humans what they

884
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,720
know and what they feel but then also

885
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,320
where your tribes are

886
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,399
and from that map you create a strategy

887
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,320
so if anyone has you know understands

888
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,880
military history strategy is what gets

889
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,880
you from a to b i can tell you what you

890
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,919
have at a

891
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,600
i can help you design what you want to

892
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,679
be and then i can show you the internal

893
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,840
and external factors you have that

894
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,239
might change the way that you choose to

895
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,520
communicate with train update or

896
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,320
you know move your army from from one

897
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,760
place to the next and that's the

898
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,239
challenge culture isn't a score it's not

899
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,399
an eight out of ten and if there's a

900
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,839
vendor out there and i'm not i'm not

901
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,359
just urging any other vendors in my

902
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:24,639
space because i think there's a lot of

903
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,079
people doing incredible work in the

904
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,079
space the industry's really come along

905
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,760
last couple years it's super exciting to

906
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,960
be here

907
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,480
but if someone's going to tell you that

908
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,639
you as an infosec team can fill out a

909
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,399
two-page form and they're gonna give you

910
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,079
an eight out of ten

911
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,599
that was probably a waste of 20 minutes

912
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:40,639
of your time

913
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,239
it's not going to tell you anything you

914
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,440
have to actually know who your people

915
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,040
are

916
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,719
so i want to change gears for a minute

917
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,320
um

918
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,159
we've worked together now for almost two

919
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,520
years

920
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,040
i know it's crazy

921
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,240
and you were in stealth for a long time

922
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,560
so let me explain so kate is an early

923
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,400
stage startup cyber maniacs is an early

924
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,800
stage startup um

925
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,800
you are looking to secure your seat

926
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,880
funding which is very exciting you have

927
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,640
some customers right now which is even

928
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,079
more exciting for a company coming out

929
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,200
of stealth

930
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,880
it's fun some decent name customers yeah

931
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,760
um why stealth so long

932
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,160
what took you i mean so this is

933
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,400
obviously a passion and

934
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,440
there's a lot to what you created here

935
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,720
why were you still so long so one of the

936
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,839
things we knew from the beginning

937
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,920
was that we weren't approaching this

938
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,280
from an inside but an outside

939
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,400
perspective

940
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,800
so none of the founding team has a

941
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,280
background in cyber security awareness

942
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,720
we have backgrounds in digital

943
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,040
transformation i have an organizational

944
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,720
anthropologist

945
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,200
a marketing scientist an hr professional

946
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,359
and some cyber researchers and then i

947
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,920
brought a crazy crew of creative talent

948
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,680
to the table and actually one of my

949
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,520
humble brags is that early on in the

950
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,599
process once we decided that puppets

951
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,200
were one of the mechanisms we were going

952
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,520
to use because of their ability to tell

953
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,440
a story because they're abstract because

954
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,119
it's a lead you know i can do things to

955
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,119
them that's illegal to do to humans

956
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,320
and people have such an emotional

957
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,920
connection to them so that's one of the

958
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,400
reasons and i can wax rap sonic for that

959
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,880
but why we chose them as a creative

960
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,119
mechanism to help get these messages

961
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,720
across because people don't see puppets

962
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,920
as scary

963
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,160
so it helps us you know create that take

964
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,920
away that fud that we were against so

965
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,280
when we looked at the space as a bunch

966
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,079
of outsiders um we really started to say

967
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,560
well if we could design anything that

968
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,640
didn't have to be l d that didn't have

969
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,440
to be scorm files right that didn't have

970
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,040
to be the kind of corporate training we

971
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,920
had all taken in our careers you know we

972
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,440
were lucky enough to have the time and

973
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,520
the energy to

974
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,480
investigate a number of approaches and

975
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,240
creative styles

976
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,800
and i'm very much about customer driven

977
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,359
design and i'm you know certified agile

978
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:04,720
po

979
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,960
and i really wanted the empirical proof

980
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,640
that what we were doing even though it

981
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,240
was creative

982
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,079
had the statistics and the data behind

983
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,440
it that what we were doing would

984
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,800
actually stick

985
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,240
because they didn't want it to seem like

986
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,680
oh they're the puppet people and they

987
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,280
just like you know throw crazy videos

988
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,599
out there i was like actually we have a

989
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,079
behavioral psychologist and marketing

990
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,079
people who pick the words and we have

991
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,760
signs and symbols that we use in all the

992
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,920
videos so there's like a layering that

993
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,000
happens beyond it so creating that

994
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,839
approach took a long time creating the

995
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,359
framework took a long time and then we

996
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,040
realized we could measure it when that

997
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,040
took some time and then we realized we

998
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,640
could put it on a platform and that's

999
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,400
what we're building now is that whole

1000
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,920
delivery mechanism and now we've

1001
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,240
realized that we can deliver the

1002
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,000
platform in a number of different ways

1003
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,400
and we can stream things we can api and

1004
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,839
we can you know so now it's sort of like

1005
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:52,720
ah

1006
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,160
and and that's where the universe has

1007
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,680
opened up because i think at the end of

1008
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,280
the day there's some big things we want

1009
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,880
to do and um

1010
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,640
you know i was very lucky to have the

1011
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,880
time to be able to figure it out before

1012
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,560
we went to market rather than the other

1013
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,240
way around

1014
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,079
it's interesting to me because you know

1015
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,079
sitting as your advisor i look at and i

1016
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,280
understand the companies that are

1017
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,480
working with you

1018
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,200
and you have a lot of resonate it's

1019
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,800
resonated very well from an iot

1020
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,920
perspective um looking at how you can

1021
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,920
use the platform to do better cyber

1022
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,520
awareness around iot

1023
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,599
it's resonated with health care it's

1024
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,000
resonated with financial services

1025
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,480
um military they don't want to admit it

1026
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,000
but they love it they love it yeah it's

1027
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,760
kind of like the it's it's the it's the

1028
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,520
unh it's the secret that they don't want

1029
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,480
to tell

1030
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,240
um

1031
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,640
what do you think your sweet spot is

1032
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,880
going to be as you come in and grow your

1033
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,720
base of customers right now

1034
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,240
is it surprised you that it's that

1035
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,079
resonated so well it's not it's not a

1036
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,880
surprise i guess in in in in a certain

1037
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,599
regard i think um because we did test so

1038
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:55,520
much and you know

1039
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,920
took some took some care with that well

1040
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,400
and i saw it white hat like i never i

1041
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,640
could not believe the reaction it was

1042
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,760
incredible

1043
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,000
but one of the things that um one of the

1044
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,599
things that we started to talk about

1045
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,280
early on was how do we find our target

1046
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,560
customer so now we're going to like

1047
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,240
sales and vendors speak but a lot of

1048
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,680
times you'll see a vendor be like well

1049
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,960
we sell to

1050
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,040
enterprises that have over those

1051
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,960
this many employees and

1052
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,000
they have to be in these three

1053
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,520
industries and so that was the question

1054
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,760
i got a lot of times when talking to

1055
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,280
to the business and the funding side of

1056
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,280
the equation and i said well we don't

1057
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,800
actually

1058
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,720
have that kind of model because i

1059
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,480
technically can deliver this to anybody

1060
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,040
who uses a computer for work

1061
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,320
so when they say well how big is your

1062
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,760
market i'm like well

1063
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,520
how many companies use computers and

1064
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,200
have people

1065
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,599
that's the market um

1066
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,200
and so what we started to look at both

1067
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,040
who would our early doctors be who we

1068
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,480
get the best traction was and what we

1069
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,720
actually um you know

1070
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,880
found was the the

1071
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,240
something around the brand and the

1072
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,280
culture so the companies that have

1073
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,960
less hierarchical culture who have a

1074
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,560
more people-focused culture who maybe

1075
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:05,760
have a fun oriented brand those who have

1076
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,160
more mature hr programs those are a

1077
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,839
little bit more innovative and agile in

1078
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,839
their cultures were easier to have those

1079
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,280
conversations with right off the bat

1080
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,720
because they wanted to try something new

1081
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,720
and they were interested in delivering

1082
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,720
things that actually delivered personal

1083
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,160
value to their people as well as

1084
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,240
corporate value so that was sort of a

1085
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,400
lock in in terms of vision and mission

1086
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,920
but the other thing we noticed was

1087
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,000
there's a huge maturity difference in

1088
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,319
awareness programs and how they're run

1089
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,560
that organizations big and small and so

1090
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,800
we were actually started to target

1091
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,359
companies that were higher on that scale

1092
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,040
where there was board level

1093
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,880
understanding of cyber security

1094
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,280
awareness and maturity that the csos

1095
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,720
were willing to have the conversations

1096
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,240
around culture and had already been

1097
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,240
asking the questions how do i do this

1098
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,520
for like years

1099
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,040
so when we came to them we said well

1100
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,400
these are the ways we think you can do

1101
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,560
it and here's the models that's where it

1102
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,000
really locked in so it's the people

1103
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,720
focus and enough cyber security maturity

1104
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,560
for our early adopters that those

1105
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,079
weren't hard conversations those were

1106
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,760
easy conversations to have because they

1107
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,000
knew that was their problem

1108
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,960
so

1109
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,160
you know

1110
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,040
you are an atypical seed at this point

1111
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,200
an early company you have a fairly

1112
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,280
established base of customers you have a

1113
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,960
very solid vision

1114
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,040
um you've got a refined product and i

1115
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,319
say that again a refined product

1116
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,920
that's been fun we're so refined

1117
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,440
where do you want to go what's your

1118
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,920
vision for the company like if the sky

1119
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,200
was the limit

1120
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,280
what do you want to accomplish

1121
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,680
so what i love is that kate asked me

1122
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,680
this question about two years ago right

1123
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,200
after she met me

1124
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,000
and and i think that we were in true

1125
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,720
founder format so focused on building i

1126
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,760
was like oh my god we're going to build

1127
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,520
it when we deliver we're deliver we're

1128
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,880
building we're gonna talk to everybody

1129
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,359
and kate's like slow down

1130
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:52,800
she's like where do you want to go and i

1131
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,000
was like oh

1132
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,760
well it'd be nice to build a big company

1133
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,119
and to help a lot of other companies

1134
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,800
keep their people secure and i want to

1135
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,480
make people happy and she's like that's

1136
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,880
not big enough she's like what do you

1137
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,560
really want to build and i was like oh

1138
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,880
god and i think i had to and i love that

1139
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,319
you challenged me on it because we had

1140
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,160
to kind of you know i sat down with my

1141
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,400
my strategy team and i had a

1142
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,040
couple of big cocktails and i said i

1143
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,960
hope it's not too much hubris but what

1144
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,680
we really want to do is create millions

1145
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,240
of happy cybersaved humans

1146
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,760
and i think there's a lot of different

1147
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,440
ways we can do that and i think we've

1148
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,440
built a brand from the beginning that

1149
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,880
was about

1150
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,359
helping people and about engaging with

1151
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:34,079
them emotionally and helping them

1152
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,839
personally change their habits so they

1153
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:38,160
can keep themselves and their families

1154
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,480
and the things that they care about safe

1155
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,520
and by extension your companies um and

1156
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,000
and i think that that's the best fastest

1157
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,839
way to get there because we

1158
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:48,880
do

1159
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,640
need to get there fast i mean every

1160
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,400
statistic out there about the human

1161
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,720
factor human firewall human errors

1162
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,880
humans are bad i i just look at and go

1163
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,359
yeah but we never really

1164
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,760
we never really got on their level and

1165
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,200
and that's what we're trying to do so

1166
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,800
we're trying to do it

1167
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,400
really at scale because i think there's

1168
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,319
a way to

1169
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,720
get people to not be afraid

1170
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,599
of taking charge of their digital future

1171
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:14,800
and i think it's never been more

1172
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,480
important to do that so once then i

1173
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,319
realized that that was our mission like

1174
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,000
the fire was lit because i was like oh

1175
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,200
no

1176
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,960
now i've thought it

1177
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,720
no we actually have to do it it's really

1178
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,760
hard

1179
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,599
so can i tell the story of our okay i'll

1180
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:28,480
tell you

1181
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,079
so

1182
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,480
met kate at white house um we became

1183
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,960
fast friends and she called me about

1184
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,480
three months later and she had a

1185
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,400
business opportunity that she wanted to

1186
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,480
look back and over with me

1187
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,200
and

1188
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,440
we kind of did we had enough we had i'm

1189
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,960
going to say it again we had an oh

1190
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,079
moment

1191
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,480
because her vision of what she thought

1192
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,240
potentially the company could be and

1193
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,480
then what was on the table

1194
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,720
opened i think the eyes of where we

1195
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,160
could take this from a potential

1196
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,920
standpoint and

1197
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,119
the thing i love as an advisor is very

1198
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,920
rarely an early stage like this

1199
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,079
do you get an opportunity to change and

1200
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:08,079
cultivate a major change in the

1201
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:09,440
marketplace

1202
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,680
so when we did the analysis i love

1203
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,359
misfits and she's one of my favorite

1204
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,359
misfits because she didn't fit in any of

1205
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,720
the boxes you know there was not another

1206
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,440
cyber education company approaching

1207
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,760
this wicked business problem

1208
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,680
and cultural problem really it's not a

1209
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,760
business problem it's a cultural problem

1210
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,520
in the same way so

1211
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,359
how do you look at a cap table where

1212
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,280
should we think about funding who's done

1213
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,720
something like this before there was

1214
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,000
nothing to measure her against

1215
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,200
and

1216
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,520
the be no don't be sorry it's the best

1217
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,599
problem ever for an advisor because

1218
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,440
here's why my parents can admit this has

1219
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,280
been sort of a track record it's all

1220
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,720
good

1221
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,680
it was interesting because

1222
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,200
every company we put her in front of

1223
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,079
all have the same reaction we need this

1224
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:00,160
it's a question of how do we

1225
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,240
align a different way

1226
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,640
and so it's fun to see kind of a

1227
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,200
revolutionary change happening from a

1228
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,640
grassroots up

1229
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,880
which is pretty awesome that way okay so

1230
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,400
we have a couple of minutes left who'd

1231
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,240
like to see one more video and we'll ask

1232
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,720
some questions all right go for it play

1233
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,720
puppets i like the puppets

1234
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,680
whatever we play along with more puppets

1235
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,520
isn't it fun

1236
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,160
please yes

1237
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,560
we actually have a composer on staff

1238
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,119
so we in terms of our creative talent we

1239
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,040
have all in-house we write our own songs

1240
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,640
we write our own

1241
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,079
um

1242
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,160
music we do our animation our lead

1243
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,280
puppeteer um and main creative advisor

1244
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,720
is actually

1245
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,920
also

1246
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,359
why won't it go big hold on a second uh

1247
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:58,078
go big or go

1248
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,560
want to do the home that's what i'm

1249
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,839
looking for um that's why it's full

1250
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:06,240
screen thank you

1251
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,720
that's what i wanted um so actually

1252
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,079
puppeteer and so one of the people that

1253
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:11,599
we started working with really early to

1254
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:13,440
make sure that it

1255
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,680
clicked creatively and emotionally we

1256
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,800
kind of went down the rabbit hole

1257
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,920
because i was like i'm building cyber

1258
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,520
education company but i'm spending half

1259
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,560
of my time with puppets

1260
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,119
i want her job mostly this is so much

1261
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:28,640
fun come work with us and we um we

1262
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,640
tapped into the the puppeteering

1263
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,920
community which is really interesting

1264
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,599
because there's so many parallels to the

1265
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,040
cyber security community it's so

1266
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,280
tight-knit there's so many amazing

1267
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,200
crafts people that work in the space and

1268
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,040
so what was a little

1269
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,720
yeah a little crazy but we thought at

1270
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,839
the beginning we're like you know what

1271
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:45,359
we'll just throw some socks on people's

1272
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,119
hands and it'll be fine like we can

1273
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:48,880
totally train this way but when we

1274
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,960
started to pilot and tested out the

1275
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,800
reactions we got to different types of

1276
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,880
videos and i will someday play the

1277
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,480
original videos we created because they

1278
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,000
suck

1279
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,440
so bad

1280
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,760
um but what we found was that the level

1281
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,839
of craft is actually critically

1282
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,839
important and so we

1283
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:07,440
wound our way through this community and

1284
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,040
we ended up finding

1285
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,560
um brian herring and you know sean and

1286
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,839
some of these other people that work

1287
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:16,079
with us on a regular basis and brian is

1288
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,119
actually

1289
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,640
one of the top tier puppeteers in the

1290
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,680
world he is the lead puppeteer for bp-8

1291
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,319
in all the star wars films

1292
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:26,160
so that's an animatronic puppet and he

1293
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,520
runs through the desert of the remote

1294
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,760
control device and i have pictures it's

1295
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,280
been an amazing education about

1296
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,520
puppeteering let me tell you yeah if

1297
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,119
you're anyone's interested in a career

1298
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:36,800
as a puppet wrangler i can explain what

1299
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,240
that is but here let's let's play

1300
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,160
something because i think also our

1301
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:44,399
composer is amazing he does great stuff

1302

worked out with five employees

1328
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,319
scalability drives me crazy because i'm

1329
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:07,440
you know i'm not i'm probably bored

1330
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,440
and everyone talks about

1331
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,359
companies that have 42500

1332
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:15,760
but if you look at the marketplace of

1333
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,800
people

1334
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,760
that's not most are you so you know

1335
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,520
this has been the huge frustration gap

1336
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,720
that i don't think so though

1337
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,680
so that's a question near and dear to my

1338
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,839
heart i come from a long line of small

1339
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:33,200
business owners in my family right and i

1340
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,000
think

1341
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,520
when i get in a conversation with my

1342
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,200
brother and my dad both own their own

1343
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,040
companies they've got about 45 employees

1344
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,359
about 35 million in turnover

1345
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:42,640
you know these are the questions that i

1346
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,559
kept on peppering them with which is you

1347
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:46,720
don't even have an i.t guy

1348
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,160
like everything is outsourced so what

1349
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,520
are you going to do and i think that's a

1350
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,400
challenge we had so we created two

1351
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,920
different versions of the product so

1352
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,839
there's two versions of the platform one

1353
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:57,359
is for the enterprise customers who are

1354
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:59,440
going to want to tweak and you know

1355
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,760
nudge and adjust curriculum paths and

1356
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,200
whatnot but then there's one that we

1357
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,760
kind of did as a diy set and forget it

1358
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,559
so

1359
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:08,559
basically the training runs on a cadence

1360
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:10,640
over the course of a year plus

1361
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,440
and

1362
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,280
it just automatically delivers training

1363
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,119
to your employees and we kind of deliver

1364
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:16,880
the reports back to you and so that's

1365
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,240
the way that we're trying to address the

1366
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,720
sme market is to make it easy for them

1367
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,000
to deliver world-class awareness that is

1368
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
personal that is fun that is interested

1369
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,160
without them having to hire an lms

1370
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,359
administrator to put courses into

1371
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:33,440
their people's files because they that's

1372
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,880
the big thing we heard from that mark is

1373
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,839
do it for me give me best in class

1374
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:40,160
make it affordable but i don't i don't

1375
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,400
have time on my staff

1376
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,359
to

1377
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:45,040
move courses around and assign things

1378
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,240
and to check if everyone's doing their

1379
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,118
training so we do that automatically

1380
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:57,770
[Music]

1381
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,960
well i think it's like you know the the

1382
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,319
there hasn't been a lot of recent

1383
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:03,760
research on this so i'm actually kind of

1384
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,119
curious to see where the numbers have

1385
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:06,960
changed in the last two years because of

1386
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,480
remote working etc but as of 2019 it was

1387
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,480
like 50 to 60 percent of large

1388
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,559
enterprises had a

1389
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,400
clearly defined cyber awareness program

1390
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,400
but it was less than 25 percent of the

1391
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,400
sme market that actually delivers this

1392
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,119
the majority of the us economy is sma

1393
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,280
right so you have exactly it's it's a

1394
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,640
real disservice and the thing we found

1395
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,359
is that the owners of those business

1396
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:30,960
want this kind of training because it

1397
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,480
helps their employees and that's what

1398
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,760
they care about so most small employers

1399
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,280
really want to build a business but they

1400
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,440
want to take care of their people that

1401
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,359
is a passion for them and so by

1402
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,119
delivering personal learning because the

1403
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:44,319
first i'm not going to go too far

1404
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:46,240
because i stopped talking but the first

1405
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,920
sort of um

1406
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,920
when we put together our competency

1407
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:50,960
model

1408
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,040
i said why are we starting with fishing

1409
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,960
fishing's the worst thing to start with

1410
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,359
it's complicated there's lots of rhyming

1411
00:52:57,359 --> 00:52:59,119
things that people think fishing

1412
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:00,640
smooshing you know like you're gonna

1413
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,559
address you're gonna talk to my mom that

1414
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,480
way like you know what

1415
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,400
it's finishing smashing sounds like dr

1416
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,079
seuss and um how much fish could a swish

1417
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,400
dish on focus but but i think what we

1418
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,520
did is what we did is we said

1419
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,040
how do we pull people in with their

1420
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,319
hearts and their minds and we have to

1421
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:19,760
give them the why so we talked to them

1422
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,520
first about cyber crime in general we

1423
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,040
talked about personal cyber crime and

1424
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,559
identity them more than we do about

1425
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:25,599
corporate

1426
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:26,880
then we talked to them about passwords

1427
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,400
and then we have five micro courses

1428
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,160
they're just on personal learning

1429
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,440
there's nothing to do we don't even say

1430
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,440
company we just say hey let's talk about

1431
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,040
your inbox hey let's talk about your

1432
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,359
social media let's talk about your phone

1433
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:38,800
and it's just sort of the new rules of

1434
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,559
the roads the new defensive driving

1435
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:43,119
course but we go to fishing social

1436
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,559
engineering and all the technical stuff

1437
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:46,319
later but that's actually what the small

1438
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,000
business owners like the most because

1439
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,559
they felt like it was a benefit

1440
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:52,240
and what we're coming out with now is

1441
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,079
protect your family protect your home

1442
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:56,400
and all that stuff is baked in

1443
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,599
okay i think we've run out of time

1444
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:01,359
hey one more question

1445
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:03,839
so how do we address

1446
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:06,240
contact

1447
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,840

1448
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,409
[Applause]
