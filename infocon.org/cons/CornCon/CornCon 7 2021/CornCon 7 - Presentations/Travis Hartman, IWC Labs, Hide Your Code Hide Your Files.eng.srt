1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,160
hello everyone how's everybody doing

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,399
welcome to track two

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,800
sean you guys don't know me by now dj

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,160
for the track

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,440
hope everyone's having a good time

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,799
enjoying the conference we really

7
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,559
appreciate everyone coming out it's good

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,800
to be back in person i'm here to

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,240
introduce our next speaker for you his

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,400
name is travis hartman an all-time corn

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,359
connor

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,680
it's actually a corncon three shirts for

13
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,199
anyone cares

14
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,880
and he's gonna make a great presentation

15
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,640
and hide your codes hide your files

16
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,840
because ai's are coming

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,239
well that was a great round of applause

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,000
so unless there's any questions

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,600
so at least i've got a goal now i have

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,600
to meet that same level of applause at

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,200
the end which could be because you

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,039
either appreciate what i said or you

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,000
know you're happy it's done

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,840
so you know a couple disclaimers i'm

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,280
sure you've seen a few today and you'll

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,039
hear some more tomorrow all the opinions

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,800
are expressing my own

28
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,080
the analysis is probably done poorly

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,519
and

30
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,360
uh what one thing is because i am trying

31
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,159
to keep it at a pretty high level

32
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,240
so that we don't get into just this

33
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,560
statistics uh a bunch of equations or

34
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,920
whatever else and if you're like oh no

35
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,200
well why are we going to k-nearest

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,040
neighbor on this or whatever it's

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,080
because we're trying to keep it high

38
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,000
enough level that we can all

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,920
okay i can understand the shape and the

40
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,799
feel

41
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,320
and this is kind of what it's doing now

42
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,840
if i peel back some layers i would get

43
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,040
to that stuff

44
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,360
but i recognize it i'm not right after

45
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,040
lunch but i'm the second speaker after

46
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,200
lunch and if i start throwing up math

47
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,000
and python

48
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,439
if somebody's going to hit their head on

49
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,520
the table and injuries and john's just

50
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,000
all upset so we won't do that

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,280
all right

52
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,439
so a little bit in my background

53
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,200
been in the army started active duty

54
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,040
went to the reserves for a while

55
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,399
i'm a cyber warfare officer i've got

56
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,479
so for my side hustle i've got 1600

57
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,640
people spread out across four countries

58
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,640
so you know as a reservist easy side

59
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,640
hustle representative a mid-sized

60
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,240
company in the u.s so

61
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,399
you know whilst doing that now you know

62
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,160
hey um since i don't have any free time

63
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,599
maybe i should go ahead and start doing

64
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,280
a phd

65
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,440
and i don't know a whole lot about ai's

66
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,040
i bet if i go get a phd in it i'm going

67
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,560
to have to learn

68
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,080
and if you ask my wife she'll tell you

69
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,319
that i have poor judgment and this helps

70
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,040
for her claim

71
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,360
okay so we're going to

72
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,519
do a little bit of that stretch

73
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,920
so if you really want to get into it yes

74
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,480
machine learning ais neural networks

75
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,239
there are differences

76
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,160
for the next hour just press the i

77
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,080
believe button we'll just we'll call it

78
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,959
all ais and we'll we'll go with it

79
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,959
and we won't get what the nuances are

80
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,120
because you probably don't actually care

81
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,879
but if

82
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,000
you saw once again we're going to get

83
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,360
that shape that feel this is the

84
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,599
direction we're going and this really

85
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,239
shows what they are so okay

86
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,920
deep learning you know that's happening

87
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,760
we've got our own networks there

88
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,000
machine learning a little more robust

89
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
more stuff going on hey guys hey it's

90
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,640
how i actually like you

91
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,920
and

92
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,480
why do i want to talk about ai's

93
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,560
part of my background i did

94
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,000
information operations a whole lot of

95
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,680
influencing people

96
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,760
and you know how do i get the population

97
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,519
of this country not to blow me up how do

98
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,440
i do this thing how do i do whatever

99
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,799
else how do i maybe help shape an

100
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,959
election somewhere else

101
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,959
um

102
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,519
my first thoughts were like okay if i

103
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,040
can manipulate people

104
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,680
to me an a.i has a decision

105
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,120
it's doing something to make a decision

106
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,640
try this on turns off let's go here

107
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,560
let's drive here let's let's stop at

108
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,239
this stop sign because there will be

109
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,120
decisions

110
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,000
maybe

111
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,440
i can figure out a way that i'm going to

112
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,360
influence that ai

113
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,879
probably needs to maintain help me get

114
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,560
there but that's what stirred me down

115
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,840
the path of

116
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,360
doing something i wasn't supposed to do

117
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,959
which is applying how do i manipulate

118
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,760
humans so we need to manipulate machines

119
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,319
and that led into an interesting realm

120
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,120
of research okay uh i'm not going to ask

121
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,959
anybody who raised hands but who's

122
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,319
around during the 80s you can introduce

123
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,840
a few

124
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,560
you've heard of the 80s right

125
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,759
okay

126
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,839
okay awesome

127
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,880
okay

128
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,280
so you know i've learned from the 80s

129
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,520
they had stuff we know what

130
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,960
what was what's the first thing you

131
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
learned about ais back in the 80s what

132
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,120
is it

133
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,080
how about killer robots terminator

134
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,280
absolutely

135
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,639
he's going to walk around he's going to

136
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,160
kill everything and

137
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,040
and then

138
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,400
schwarzenegger's going to leave a couple

139
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,479
of lines and then there'll be a sequel

140
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:43,680
and

141
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,960
there'll be another sequel and then

142
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,199
he'll be like 70 and there's 19 sequels

143
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,919
and repeats

144
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,759
yeah i mean and i like how the the date

145
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,600
first guide has changed a few times over

146
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,800
the years

147
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,479
and normally

148
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,800
at my company i've got my old corporate

149
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,840
badge i've also got a cyber iron systems

150
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,720
that's only one on the outside and the

151
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,240
security people like i don't recognize

152
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,440
that company but it sounds really

153
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,470
familiar

154
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,320
[Music]

155
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,600
okay so

156
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,280
what else did we learn about autonomous

157
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,759
systems or ais

158
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,160
you know another one i remember which

159
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,520
was yeah there's gonna be autonomous

160
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,960
cars of course i'll tell you i'm gonna

161
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,400
have autonomous they're gonna be flying

162
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,520
cars and stuff it wasn't flying cars

163
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,160
it was maximum overdrive it was every

164
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,520
everything that plugged in that had

165
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,280
electricity going through it suddenly

166
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,039
has some degree of processing it was

167
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,560
driven by aliens and was attacking

168
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,759
people

169
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,639
and

170
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,479
yeah

171
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,479
so i think they made up after the movie

172
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,800
and they became friends and and it was

173
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,680
like a buddy top story

174
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,800
all right

175
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,400
okay so you know look a little bit more

176
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,000
modern so this has actually been in the

177
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,520
2000s

178
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,759
yay all right

179
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,960
who seen slaughterbots

180
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,919
nobody's watched the slaughterbots video

181
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,240
okay so your homework later is to go

182
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,960
watch the slaughterbots video

183
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,520
it's about six minutes long so we're not

184
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,960
going to do it now but hey if i get

185
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,160
wrapped up early we'll watch the

186
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,800
slaughterbox video

187
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,639
and what they were talking about i think

188
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,120
this was 2019 it came out

189
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,840
this was a far future tech

190
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,800
it was small ai controlled drones fit in

191
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,880
the palm of your hand and they had a

192
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,880
small explosive charger you think

193
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,120
essentially a 22 round

194
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,039
ai would control the swarm of these they

195
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,080
would come in and do some facial

196
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,479
recognition and go ah i can tell between

197
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,319
this line of three bald white guys which

198
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,160
one i'm actually after there's a beard

199
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,720
glasses or one of the above

200
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,960
and you know three or four drones come

201
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,120
flying after the person and boom falls

202
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,560
down and in the video they're showing

203
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,720
mass deployments of these and swarming

204
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,400
through the vents of the building like

205
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,759
taking out everybody in the political

206
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,759
party and so it's not too dis most of

207
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,440
the tech is actually there right now

208
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,160
that's actually the exact i knew we had

209
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,599
kids at the conference so i had to go

210
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,080
find the pg version of the shooting in

211
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,160
the forehead versus

212
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,400
some of the ones in the video

213
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,039
all right so in reality

214
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,560
we've seen some autonomous systems out

215
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,120
there and you think about it there's

216
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,960
actually autonomous racing full-size

217
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,199
cars i think that's pretty cool

218
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,639
and when you start doing

219
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,199
this level of autonomy i'm not having to

220
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,440
build the frame of whatever is going on

221
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,319
to support the squishy meat bag of a

222
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,360
human

223
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,199
i'm not limited by the size and shape of

224
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,360
a human i'm not limited by you know for

225
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,520
g-forces or anything else i'm now

226
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,800
dealing with the materials and the

227
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,199
components i don't need pressurized

228
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,400
oxygen at 35 000 feet

229
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,479
i don't need a hollow space to stick a

230
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,319
person i can use it for something else

231
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,440
and we're starting to see some shapes

232
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,199
like this one yeah it's still got some

233
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,960
a little thin on the back which i think

234
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,960
is actually the antenna reminiscent of

235
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,680
like a 1950s indycar headrest or

236
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,560
something

237
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,080
yeah we can change the designs now

238
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,840
because that's available

239
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,720
and just recently one of the best

240
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,599
technology pieces ai power came out that

241
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,360
i knew everybody was actually hoping for

242
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,400
who's got a robot

243
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,639
any sort of vacuum automated at your

244
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,120
house okay who's heard the stories uh my

245
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,479
dog was sick or something well so

246
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,479
their newest version

247
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,399
the cutting edge technology we have

248
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,559
today for 850

249
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,240
you can get your vacuum to put running

250
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,679
through the dog poo and spreading it all

251
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,560
over your house while you're at work

252
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,279
this is the cutting edge

253
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,760
i installed i can get 20-year robots 40

254
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,760
years ago and instead i'm having to pay

255
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,640
800 so if my dog gets sick

256
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,000
it's not in three different rooms

257
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,040
do you ever feel like they lie to you in

258
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,000
the movies okay

259
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,360
so let's actually look at what's

260
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,279
happening with ai's attacking things

261
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,040
and there's a few different scenarios

262
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,360
out there the navy's looked at it

263
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,880
and

264
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,640
you know the big thing is if i'm relying

265
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,040
on a human in the loop i'm slow

266
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,880
i'm way slow

267
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,680
if it's ai's they're attacking me

268
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,680
there's no way that i can re react in

269
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,120
time

270
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,399
because they're going to be able to go

271
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,839
after one thing the next thing the next

272
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,040
thing next there are systems on

273
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,399
naval vessels

274
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,240
they are largely autonomous essentially

275
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,839
the humans can do the decision we're

276
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,279
going to turn it on and it's going to go

277
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,959
so hey there's

278
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,279
an incoming missile

279
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,000
the

280
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,399
sea wizard is yup see what this fire's

281
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,839
off you know all this stuff lots of

282
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,200
stuff in the air missile blows up

283
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,120
doesn't hit the ship yay if i had to

284
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,279
have a human in it that would never work

285
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,720
okay what systems i actually have on the

286
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,399
ship you start thinking about this it's

287
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,000
a floating city so i've got hvac i've

288
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,279
got all my fuel

289
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,760
delivery and i've got water desalination

290
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,880
and

291
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,880
a huge amount of stuff so what if you

292
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,279
know my ai was actually going after some

293
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,800
of those support systems

294
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,240
because i do have the meat bags on the

295
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,519
ship

296
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,600
so wow that's actually what i'm having

297
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,680
to consider

298
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,200
what if i'm

299
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,519
authorizing the ai to control more than

300
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,279
lethal systems not just those defensive

301
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,120
ones

302
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,680
and so i could actually launch a team a

303
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,600
tomahawk whistle at somebody and it's

304
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,480
all being powered by the uh

305
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,120
defensive systems that's a pretty

306
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,040
straightforward control and i think we

307
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,040
actually have had some autonomous

308
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,720
defensive systems

309
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,880
not used in the us but south korea had

310
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,880
them back in the 90s

311
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,560
they were using the dmz

312
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,600
because some of that was pretty

313
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,839
straightforward hey we're here in south

314
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,680
korea and everything that direction is

315
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,920
north korea and there's a five kilometer

316
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,519
dmz where nobody's supposed to be in it

317
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,680
between here and there so if a human is

318
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,600
walking around anywhere on this side of

319
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,279
the line

320
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,880
it's probably legally okay for me to

321
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,640
shoot them and that was one of the

322
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,720
earlier cases where they really applied

323
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,000
so

324
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,920
why are we talking well of course

325
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,880
robots are really cool but um

326
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,560
a lot of the discussion ends up focusing

327
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,480
around lethal systems

328
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,560
and you'll hear laws it's lethal

329
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,480
autonomous weapon systems

330
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,560
yeah they're they're a little bit scary

331
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,920
but

332
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,079
just like in moving maximum overdrive

333
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,360
you got to get fuel you have to do

334
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,760
things to keep it going so

335
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,200
there are limitations it's not going to

336
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,040
be completely autonomous for more than a

337
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,160
few hours it may be a few days

338
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,880
the thing i think we do wrong as people

339
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,279
or as professionals is we get focused in

340
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,480
on those laws

341
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,399
about the legal the autonomous weapons

342
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,760
systems

343
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,839
and we miss all the other areas where

344
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,000
ais can do stuff for us or we could do

345
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,399
stuff to ais or we can use those ais you

346
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,320
think about one of the things

347
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,000
okay i'm wanting to automate the defense

348
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,040
on my networks okay we're on that ship

349
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,800
so they start detecting intruder they

350
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,240
start locking down more firewalls

351
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,600
restricted ports restricting

352
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,959
applications

353
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,360
rolling some passwords whatever else

354
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,720
i don't necessarily need a human in the

355
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,200
loop for that it's completely defensive

356
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,720
maybe it's going to slow down some stuff

357
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,880
and the the milkshake machine breaks but

358
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,320
then we just pretend we're mcdonald's

359
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,480
instead of an aircraft carrier and and

360
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,959
why it's all fun

361
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,680
who's heard of the company uh called

362
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,959
verizon three

363
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,040
anybody

364
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,399
okay so a gentleman named

365
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,360
uh former cto of splunk uh then he was

366
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,360
off working at joint special operations

367
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,639
command for a while

368
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,160
and saw hey you know that's really smart

369
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,000
people doing some really creative things

370
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,800
there and how can we actually do more

371
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,720
stuff and as he started looking and

372
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,560
stuff there's a group of them to launch

373
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,720
this company called verizon 3d

374
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,279
and these slides will be available later

375
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,959
but this is actually showing the time

376
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,279
sequence it was completely ai driven it

377
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,279
was doing penetration testing

378
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,519
if you think about at some level there's

379
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,399
what's happening with a lot of

380
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,240
penetration tests what's what's the

381
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,720
first step

382
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,240
you know doing some scanning or

383
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,240
something seeing what's available

384
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,360
trying to find some services

385
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,240
yeah so three minutes from start to

386
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,920
admit on the system

387
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,320
and no human interaction

388
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,560
and

389
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,160
the

390
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,240
what's the uh the statement of any time

391
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,000
you make it

392
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,079
anytime you make a claim about

393
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,880
processing power uh the two disclaimers

394
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,399
are assuming you know

395
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,760
or how long it takes to do something

396
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,680
computing it seems no major changes

397
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,600
number theory or processing so once

398
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,720
again we're talking i'm going to talk

399
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,240
about equations

400
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,600
three minutes could they do faster if

401
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,480
they need to have a little more

402
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,079
processing power behind it

403
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,440
if i could actually get a video card

404
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,720
that somebody wasn't using for mining

405
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,720
cryptocurrency

406
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,079
but somebody appreciates it because i

407
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,880
still get them um

408
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,440
yeah so their their company and if you

409
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,720
check out their website and i believe

410
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,399
it's no zeros what they're calling their

411
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,360
system

412
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,440
it goes out it will do automated testing

413
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,880
and

414
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,839
yeah they're selling this is

415
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,680
subscription service it makes sense it

416
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,199
came from splunk so

417
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,040
you know splunk is a very excellent

418
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,000
company

419
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,600
they work quite well at taking large

420
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,000
amounts of money and transferring from

421
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,079
your network or your your bank account

422
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,320
into their own and at some point they're

423
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,839
also moving a large amount of data into

424
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,399
their system

425
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,079
that was not a paid advertisement

426
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,519
so

427
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,800
i talked to talk about speed we're

428
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,240
dealing with systems so what you want we

429
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,320
got to do with the speed on these things

430
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,399
i i have what i call the the linear

431
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,440
skier skinner uh maxim for security

432
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,279
i don't have to be the fastest thing out

433
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,880
there i don't have to be the best thing

434
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,199
i just need i need a little head start

435
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,120
if i know you're going to attack

436
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,519
who's been to a surprise party

437
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,519
somebody okay you seen it on tv whatever

438
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,440
else okay

439
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,880
if you know there's a surprise party it

440
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,880
doesn't really work because you know

441
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,560
what's gonna happen hey if somebody's

442
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,920
gonna put a roadside bomb and i know

443
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,880
it's there

444
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,160
i'm not going to drive past it it

445
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,760
doesn't matter because i do you know

446
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,279
i've got that little bit of advanced

447
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,600
notice i can do some things

448
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,240
if i can't get ahead of that ai that's

449
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,760
going to be maybe attacking my network i

450
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,279
need to look at mechanisms that i can

451
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,480
use

452
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,480
they can either give me a more advanced

453
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,480
warning or i'm going to adjust the way

454
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,880
that i have triggers so

455
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,800
maybe if i knew i was only dealing with

456
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,560
humans i'd be saying you know what you

457
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,480
know i got a poor scan from this iep but

458
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,000
i'm not going to block them out yet i

459
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,480
want to see what else they do

460
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,600
versus okay i now know there's ais that

461
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,839
are seeking to attack my network some

462
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,000
may be contracted some may be home home

463
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,600
brewed

464
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,759
something just scanned like three ips

465
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,120
and now i'm blocking them for the next

466
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,120
week because

467
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,759
i i don't have time to try and react

468
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,000
later i have to speed up my response

469
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,800
cycle see what i can take out of that

470
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,480
have you ever talked about rna or is

471
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,040
that tomorrow

472
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,880
awesome so after me you need to hear his

473
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,720
presentation when he's talking about rmf

474
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,480
and the accreditation system but once

475
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,839
again looking at how do we accelerate

476
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,120
that cycle how do we move things a

477
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,440
little bit ahead

478
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,000
all right

479
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
so you start to look at

480
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,920
how do i get ais that are maybe going to

481
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,440
actually because i said you know we're

482
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,199
going to be attacking stuff but we know

483
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,440
you guys can attack my network and then

484
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,560
i can go

485
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,399
in the next 20 minutes sign up and put

486
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,000
in some ids and get a trial account with

487
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,160
that company and hey i'll be off and

488
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,759
running

489
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,279
but how do i actually use ai's now you

490
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,360
know what are you being used for to

491
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,360
manipulate people and see what's out

492
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,480
there who's familiar with geek fix

493
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,680
yeah i got about half the room awesome

494
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,600
all right

495
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,759
so this is how a lot of those are made

496
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,600
this is actually two ais that are

497
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,839
playing against each other

498
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,919
it's called a generative adversarial

499
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,079
network or a gam

500
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,199
so

501
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,880
the generator is one ai it's got

502
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,119
some fuzzy stuff some randomness that's

503
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,679
going on and it's going to be

504
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,679
generating in this case let's just call

505
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,679
images and to go with stuff in the

506
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,280
future it's generating pictures that

507
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,679
either look like cats or dogs

508
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:28,960
and

509
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,039
the discriminator will the discriminator

510
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,679
had real training data initially

511
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,520
so that's what's up there in that top

512
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,520
left the real world images so we've had

513
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,200
that discriminator here's a bunch of

514
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,799
cats so here's a bunch of dogs here's

515
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,559
what these animals look like

516
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,200
okay great

517
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,880
so the generator is going to

518
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,480
spit out an image

519
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,679
and it goes in and goes hey

520
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,840
um

521
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,160
is this a cat or a dog it's a bunch of

522
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,720
pixels so the discriminator says no it's

523
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,160
not either whatever you're editing

524
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,160
and then there's a feedback loop that's

525
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,320
not shown on there it's going back and

526
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,760
saying ah okay you know the last thing

527
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,840
you threw at me it didn't pass

528
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,640
so it will continually do adjustments

529
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,320
and if i'm wanting to i want to create

530
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,320
images that look like real humans

531
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,799
great you can do that i want to do it so

532
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,720
it sounds like real voice patterns yeah

533
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,160
i want to do that

534
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,520
and

535
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,919
yes it will iterate and there's a number

536
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,960
of mechanisms which once again math and

537
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,240
different algorithms that are happening

538
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,520
on the back end

539
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,960
to really go ahead and

540
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,840
contribute to how efficient it is some

541
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,679
of it uh if you're going to start to go

542
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,440
to the video direction

543
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,640
it's depending on some of the training

544
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,919
data how quick they can generate this

545
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,400
has anybody seen this video clicking

546
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,039
i see a few head nuts there all right

547
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,080
somebody that's not in your head you

548
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,840
want to shout out what this video was

549
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,360
and so i'll repeat so that the people

550
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,360
watching later from the recording

551
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,799
so it was a deep fake

552
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,320
and essentially they're doing motion

553
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,280
capture

554
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,840
or gentlemen there on the left

555
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,200
but then it's

556
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,960
you're seeing everything on the right

557
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,960
president obama it's his face his voice

558
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,280
his muscle movements a little twitch in

559
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,240
the cheek those all look like him and it

560
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,280
was essentially done in real time

561
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,640
so

562
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,160
pretty soon you know we are actually

563
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,760
getting towards the movie level now and

564
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,720
what we can do with with the ais oh well

565
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,799
they did a video call and they said this

566
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,280
wow i mean i didn't look like it but i

567
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,720
think i know what my mom looks like i've

568
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,720
seen her a couple times in my life

569
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,000
but

570
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,840
you know she just called me and said

571
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,679
that the farmer down bro is getting rid

572
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,280
of this tractor and getting a sports car

573
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,200
i don't know but

574
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,520
that was a terrible thing but it was the

575
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,600
only iowa thing i came up with

576
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,679
off the cuff so just a little ignore

577
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,520
that one

578
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,400
yeah so this is actually the first 2019

579
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,679
was the first time i started to see the

580
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:06,960
deep fakes

581
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,159
and

582
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,600
they were a little slow they were a

583
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,280
little choppy you know some of this

584
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,559
stuff

585
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,960
it's just like snapchat filters

586
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,039
oh nope the filter fell off they're

587
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,640
actually overnight or whatever

588
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,640
the last three years the algorithms have

589
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,080
continued to improve the training data

590
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,760
has continued to improve

591
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,679
the visibility of whether this is a fake

592
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,640
or not is much much harder

593
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,559
and because we have young people here i

594
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,480
will not play it but i will mention it

595
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,480
and i'll have a link to it later

596
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,880
if you go on youtube and you can search

597
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,480
deep fake or six presidents nwa

598
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,080
they've got truman kennedy obama

599
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,120
trump

600
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,240
a couple other folks it's their voices

601
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,440
doing

602
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,559
a song by nwa

603
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,720
okay well this is just the audio so

604
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,400
if we get wrapped up early maybe we'll

605
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,320
stop the recording and you can hear six

606
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,919
different presidents do

607
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,600
after the police which

608
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,799
uh

609
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,039
the combination of the kennedy obama and

610
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,280
trump is pretty

611
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,918
that's critical

612
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,280
all right all right so if i'm gonna have

613
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,799
ai's they're attacking stuff they're

614
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,960
able to do stuff they're they're helping

615
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,799
influence me

616
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,799
and i've got ais that are doing the

617
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,480
generated stuff i've got one ai trying

618
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,559
to influence another ai and get stuff

619
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,120
past it well

620
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,960
can i actually explain

621
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,840
this

622
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,440
research if i can explain what's going

623
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,360
on with this ai then i know what's going

624
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,720
just like i know what the attack on my

625
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,080
network and it goes through here and

626
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,360
they do the port scanning and then they

627
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,280
do this and then they come here and then

628
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,799
they jump post

629
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,480
and so i can stop them right there if i

630
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,480
can just explain and understand so the

631
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,159
short answer is called xai or

632
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,760
explainable ai

633
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,880
and the answer is no

634
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,159
because math

635
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,400
and a whole bunch of reasons

636
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,200
uh

637
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,360
but

638
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,799
there's not a guarantee i would say that

639
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,240
if i ask this thing two times i'm always

640
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,919
gonna get exactly the same answer or i'm

641
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,679
always gonna get the same output you

642
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,120
probably have a cone of probability and

643
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,960
you know it's going to be in that area

644
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,799
but there's no guarantee i can tell them

645
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,200
exactly what's going on it's not just a

646
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,440
straight algorithm

647
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,280
or you know hey i'm propagating through

648
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,799
the network i'm going to go from this

649
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,720
node to this node

650
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,200
decorating right to ttl each time and

651
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,400
blah blah blah blah blah eventually

652
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,440
package

653
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,039
doesn't work like that

654
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,720
um

655
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,120
and so we've got some ambiguity that

656
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,240
we're going to have to deal with if

657
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,919
we're going to actually try and poke

658
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,400
back at the ais so

659
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,679
you know what what are we going to do

660
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,000
with this

661
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,720
oh awesome so

662
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,320
i don't know exactly what's going on but

663
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,840
i can start to get some ideas of what's

664
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,960
going on

665
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,679
i get values i get spaces

666
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:58,799
it sounds like we're getting too close

667
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,720
to math doesn't it

668
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,039
okay

669
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,320
ultimately one way i like to

670
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,080
picture it and somebody will tell me i'm

671
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,679
wrong but that's okay

672
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,080
so i've got neural networks

673
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,640
i may have multi-dimensions of data that

674
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,480
i'm dealing with in what's called future

675
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,240
space where the data that's been learned

676
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,080
websites it's built

677
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,120
anybody ever programmed in cobalt

678
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,480
ah excellent

679
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,850
i will point out the person

680
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,600
[Music]

681
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,919
yes i've done an eight-dimensional array

682
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,760
which is fine up until like five

683
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,440
dimensions and i tried to picture it and

684
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,880
then i was on the floor

685
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,480
but

686
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,240
if you just say hey i'll press the i

687
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,080
believe button there's

688
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,159
two three five seven there's multiple

689
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,919
dimensions that are happening

690
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,000
in this feature space all the area where

691
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,440
that one ai was learning from the images

692
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,480
and

693
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,520
okay

694
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,440
you'll find something with a human you

695
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,360
know in my head i'm like oh okay well is

696
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,279
this tall this hair color or this lack

697
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,799
of hair or whatever

698
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,600
this way this isn't okay i can picture

699
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,840
this maybe this is what those dimensions

700
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,720
actually mean and if i take the right

701
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,559
path through all these dimensions i come

702
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,440
up

703
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,520
with somebody's little candy bars

704
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,039
so not not too bad

705
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,000
so we're gonna start looking at you know

706
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,120
what i'm sorry about we've got a feature

707
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,678
space here

708
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,520
yeah that's a bunch of words and vectors

709
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,080
and eigenvectors and all of that stuff

710
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,840
so once again

711
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,440
i'm describing something if we did all

712
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,720
those layers

713
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,080
height weight

714
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,440
hair color

715
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,720
just pretend each one does this

716
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,400
dimension there's a line connecting all

717
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,279
those things and we'll say that that's

718
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,960
that's our nifty vector floating through

719
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,120
space that actually refers to that piece

720
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,760
of information

721
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,600
so i can't completely explain it but hey

722
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,279
i know i can attack it

723
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,240
um

724
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,240
the great thing about ai all the stuff i

725
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,320
can do to attack a computer

726
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,559
i can actually do attacking the eye

727
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,880
i can unplug it

728
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,200
i can cut the networking has anybody

729
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,880
encountered this strategic backhoe

730
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,720
yeah

731
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,320
that will shut your whole facility down

732
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,400
really quick

733
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,720
all right

734
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,640
i've encountered that a few times

735
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,240
and it's

736
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,400
day for having multiple runs of fiber

737
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,240
going to different isps of different

738
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,960
ends of the building

739
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,480
but so if i want to attack the ai

740
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,400
there are some limitations that we're

741
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,760
looking at

742
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,440
what an ai can do

743
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,440
it's driven by or what it

744
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,200
i can't do maybe to protect the air

745
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,880
because of the algorithms

746
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,320
and just like

747
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,320
i'll say a few decades ago or last week

748
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,840
in cyber security

749
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,960
systems weren't always built with

750
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,760
security in mind and so because i'm

751
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,520
built to operate what are you built to

752
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,480
keep things out no i'm built to operate

753
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,720
what was the the favorite phrase people

754
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,240
love to hear whether looking at a new

755
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,799
system or a new area where technology is

756
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:13,919
involved

757
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,240
and the person that designed it says

758
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,600
why would anybody try that to attack us

759
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,320
wow we got the gui center right there

760
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,799
there is no crunchy outer shell

761
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,200
and some ais we know that we can do some

762
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,559
of this stuff and this actually got me

763
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,400
really excited because my thought

764
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,200
earlier i want to manipulate the ai i

765
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,720
want to just oh

766
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,840
wow

767
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,480
so uh

768
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,480
kind of like a giveaway i'm gonna do it

769
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,559
okay i would have to say i watch fox

770
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,880
news and this one watching msnbc and

771
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,559
i'll see how much they they start

772
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,159
changing their voting patterns or

773
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,960
something but you know it can put

774
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,640
manipulation of what's going on

775
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,640
i think that yorkie is like a demon

776
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,919
i talked earlier about how we've got

777
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,279
the two images that we're dealing with

778
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,360
in classification or two categories so

779
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,320
i've got cats and i've got dogs

780
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,919
if i was using my ai i can run through

781
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,279
that classification it would start to

782
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,000
say

783
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,919
hey these are cats these are dogs

784
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,200
this is

785
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,559
probably a cat

786
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,399
and i end up with this cluster of

787
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,720
information

788
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,320
okay that's pretty cool

789
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,520
so

790
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,720
we start c is

791
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,520
okay

792
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,039
the information starts getting closer

793
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,000
and this

794
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,520
so it's just a two-dimensional scatter

795
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,440
plot and what it kind of did was took

796
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,440
those

797
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,640
five dimensions and smooshed it down

798
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,559
uh smoosh being the highly technical

799
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,799
term

800
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,880
but at least this way i can visualize it

801
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,039
and it's been accepted in

802
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,000
in multiple different research papers so

803
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,679
as a way of visualizing the feature

804
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,000
space now i can do that and i can kind

805
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,320
of see that here's my dogs and here's my

806
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,919
cats

807
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,520
we'll go with the dogs are green and the

808
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,880
cats

809
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,679
are red because they have claws and

810
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,880
blood and stuff but

811
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,120
it starts moving but if you also look at

812
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,440
that line that goes through the middle

813
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,320
and

814
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,279
a couple things to point out one there's

815
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,880
cats and dogs on the wrong side of the

816
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,200
line

817
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,640
because i know which one's a cat and

818
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,919
which one's a dog because i googled but

819
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:32,000
the and the line is not completely

820
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,120
straight

821
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,399
because why is it not straight is

822
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,559
because it's actually

823
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,000
pictured as it goes through five

824
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
different dimensions so

825
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,399
yeah because because there isn't math

826
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,919
and so the line's not straight and i get

827
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,320
stuff that's not there on one side or

828
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,440
another

829
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,799
well

830
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,600
but this this is showing the the

831
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,120
machine learning this is showing what

832
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,399
has happened as it went through he did

833
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,320
that categorization

834
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,520
well

835
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,039
okay

836
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,559
so if if i

837
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,880
was trying to influence a person

838
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,159
i probably want to do something where i

839
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,159
can move that line

840
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,679
and what's happening with some of the

841
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,799
research that's out there right now

842
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,440
they said okay you'll get some values

843
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,799
there there we're going to start

844
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,880
generating values

845
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,159
once again going back to that

846
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,919
adversarial network that gan type

847
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,840
scenario i'm going to generate new

848
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,279
values and it's going to go into the

849
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,880
learning it's going to end up in feature

850
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,399
space and there's going to be new dots

851
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,440
showing up

852
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,799
they're not from real things they're

853
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,960
things that another ai created

854
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,919
but what that's doing

855
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,080
this picture every dot is having its own

856
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,600
little gravity well

857
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,120
we'll work a space science fiction thing

858
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:41,840
here

859
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,600
so you know i've got each one of those

860
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,480
things it's kind of like this little

861
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,320
gravity well depending on how far the

862
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,320
way it is from the line or how close

863
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,120
it's helping pull and shape that line

864
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,240
so wow

865
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,159
most of the research so far has been

866
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,120
around

867
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,360
can i generate stuff and

868
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,159
uh throw it in this general area or

869
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,840
throw it in that general area can i

870
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,760
throw it near the line can i throw it

871
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,120
back over here

872
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,880
and for the most part you know research

873
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,399
has been successful they've been able to

874
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,840
do that and it's done some manipulation

875
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,039
and movement of the boundary lines

876
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,200
from from having done stuff working to

877
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,170
influence people

878
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:20,960
[Music]

879
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,039
it's a little bit like the heisenberg an

880
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,200
uncertainty principle

881
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,279
uh if if somebody knows they're being

882
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,120
manipulated it's harder to manipulate

883
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,360
them so i don't want to be detecting i

884
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,799
mean if

885
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,880
um you know if i i had this i'm like wow

886
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,039
this is pretty cool so okay

887
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,080
all right

888
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,200
i'm getting away with one dot there

889
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,320
pretty soon you start saying okay

890
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,520
there's something weird that's going on

891
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,640
here because all this stuff's happening

892
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,240
i want to be precise i don't want

893
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,880
artillery i want a sniper rifle

894
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,159
and

895
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,080
that's actually the direction that i'm

896
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,760
going is generating stuff in the

897
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,840
multi-dimensional space and then but

898
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,960
giving it precise placement because if i

899
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,960
get precise placement

900
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,360
then i can shape that line through the

901
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,760
multi-dimensional space

902
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,679
just how i need so when i ask on this

903
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,840
one thing right here is it a cat or a

904
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,360
dog

905
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,360
it comes back and it tells me it's a dog

906
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,120
it was a cat yesterday but i put a

907
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,120
couple things and shifted the line just

908
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,240
enough

909
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,840
and then i went to bed with my wife on

910
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,639
where we go to dinner

911
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,640
it's it's probably the easiest way i can

912
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,159
win a bed with my wife

913
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,240
but you know so that that's direction

914
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,159
there is a way to actually go in and

915
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,960
manipulate the ais

916
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,279
but in this case it's an attack actually

917
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,960
on this learning data

918
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,000
there's

919
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,679
other attacks that you would actually

920
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,600
that are available out there

921
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,240
that go into

922
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,799
the street

923
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,480
attacking the the training data set

924
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,159
itself we're injecting into the training

925
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:53,360
data set

926
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,120
yes this is

927
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,799
seeking to inject into the training data

928
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:57,840
set

929
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,799
there's

930
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,919
and while i'm trying to this one is

931
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,159
seeking to adjust or manipulate where

932
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,000
the boundary line is where the decision

933
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,760
boundary is there's other ones where i

934
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,159
could just create something new

935
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,320
has anybody heard of the uh the stop

936
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,840
sign or the post-it note attacks

937
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,440
but he's i got something back

938
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,960
there i got a couple of doorways here

939
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,000
like you're waiting in the hands if you

940
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,559
guys all right so i've got an autonomous

941
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,320
car and it's driving around it's really

942
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,840
cool and well

943
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,519
let's go it's a tesla because it's you

944
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,720
know causing anonymous we've all our

945
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,760
teslas and and it sees a stop sign and

946
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,279
so it stops

947
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,840
yeah octagon red

948
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,760
white letters

949
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,320
and then okay well if i'm training on

950
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,320
images i don't give a one picture of a

951
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,919
stop sign

952
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,320
i get pictures from a bunch of different

953
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,519
angles you know higher up lower down

954
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,519
some of it smudge whatever else but it's

955
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,440
always you know the same

956
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,039
general characteristics somehow it is

957
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,679
octagon the white the red may be

958
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,279
reflected

959
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,960
and every time somebody logs into a

960
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,720
website they have to do a captcha

961
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,559
congratulations you're helping verify

962
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,519
and train in ai

963
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,559
so i always add like one pedestrian to

964
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,159
my list of motorcycles they want me to

965
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,240
select

966
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,559
i'll find out if it pans out eventually

967
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,799
um

968
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,159
but okay so great so

969
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,760
what would i do if i'm having to do it

970
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,440
if i've got the stop sign

971
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,279
well if i tried to say this isn't a stop

972
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,039
sign that would be

973
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,120
very hard to convince it it's not a stop

974
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,720
sign because it

975
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,799
i've got 11 000 images of stop signs

976
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,960
from different angles

977
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,000
but wait a minute i know there's a

978
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,760
decision boundary between stop signs and

979
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,080
things that are not stop sounds

980
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,799
so i'm going to take a blue post-it note

981
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,200
i am going to go put it on a stop sign

982
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
i'm going to take pictures from

983
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,919
different angles

984
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,840
[Music]

985
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,919
so i'll start generating images of this

986
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,679
from all sorts of different angles

987
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,519
and moving that around one of the

988
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,000
attacks they actually did this with uh i

989
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,720
think it was irpa that did research on

990
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,440
it

991
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,679
and they were training it to say no this

992
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,918
is a speed limit sign

993
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,520
otherwise you can say like no this isn't

994
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,760
a stop sign this is bob

995
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,560
and

996
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,679
then

997
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,760
okay only

998
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,760
tesla sees a stop sign it comes up it

999
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,879
stops

1000
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,520
nobody knows that it's been manipulated

1001
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,239
until one time you're rolling along

1002
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,760
there's a post-it note on the stop sign

1003
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,079
and tesla's like hey bob it rolls into

1004
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,679
the intersection

1005
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,520
so once again somebody through that

1006
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,280
training through that manipulation of

1007
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,359
the data that it's learning from

1008
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,599
changes what the decision boundary is

1009
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,119
and then at the time and place of their

1010
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,639
choosing they're able to get the results

1011
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,879
they want

1012
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,440
i don't know why they want somebody to

1013
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,839
roll into the intersection but

1014
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,280
we'll roll with it because it's a story

1015
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,240
and we're not using math

1016
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:57,599
okay

1017
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:58,720
so

1018
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,720
the

1019
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,280
going back to

1020
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,480
my my battleship uh scenario

1021
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,359
uh the one the ai or the one the navy

1022
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:10,880
tends to use a lot

1023
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,720
was how many systems they could actually

1024
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,800
automate how much stuff they could

1025
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,440
start to hand over to aots and what they

1026
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,280
were looking at was it's no longer the

1027
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,920
question of the lethal systems

1028
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,920
uh or when i can't overstuff the lethal

1029
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,920
systems or is my only discussion around

1030
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,839
the system so now you know the more

1031
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,800
stuff i hand to the ai to do

1032
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,040
the more stuff that i can offload to

1033
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,480
humans

1034
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,040
if because you know ai's real virtually

1035
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,520
cheap it's processing power

1036
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,400
and

1037
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,599
humans are creative we're devious little

1038
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,480
people

1039
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,320
uh he would come up with all sorts of

1040
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,000
weird ideas we're trying to do stuff

1041
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,760
that's not supposed to happen

1042
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,760
so i can free up my humans

1043
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,680
that are back on the base or not doing

1044
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,800
stuff on the ship because i got other

1045
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,560
stuff being raised

1046
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,160
is it going to stop that one attack

1047
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,079
maybe not but i've got all my human

1048
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,240
creativity i just freed up 10 000 people

1049
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,839
to come up with some really weird wild

1050
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,480
ideas and do some neat stuff

1051
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,000
i didn't like the equation before i

1052
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,680
didn't like the comparison so i'm just

1053
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,680
going to substitute my own reality i'm

1054
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,599
going to take my humans out of that part

1055
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:14,720
of the thing i'm going to put them

1056
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,320
somewhere else

1057
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,480
anytime i can have a car that's being

1058
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,040
taken driven around by an ai great

1059
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,280
i've got another human i can go use for

1060
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,720
something else creative something else

1061
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,800
is human unique

1062
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,839
and they'll come up with some wild ideas

1063
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:30,880
and

1064
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,800
we're a bunch of tick tock videos

1065
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,839
and

1066
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:34,960
in kitty you know there's going to be

1067
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,160
new stuff out there but maybe that tick

1068
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,000
tock video inspires somebody else to say

1069
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
you know what

1070
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,160
i didn't start putting these linkages

1071
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,480
together but now since i saw that and i

1072
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,520
do this

1073
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,359
so i can actually influence this other

1074
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,640
piece here

1075
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,599
the

1076
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,160
uh i think the the current state of some

1077
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,400
of the things in the military there's

1078
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
conditional approval

1079
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,160
and once again i'm not a spokesperson

1080
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,000
for the military i'm not aware of any uh

1081
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,280
systems that are presently in this

1082
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,680
configuration but it's some discussions

1083
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,960
are more focused around like a

1084
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,280
conditional approval

1085
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,880
if my ship's at port in san diego

1086
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,680
no

1087
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,440
you know none of the autonomous

1088
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,359
offensive weapon systems you're not

1089
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,960
allowed to do anything

1090
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,400
if i'm

1091
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,920
in the

1092
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,920
middle of nowhere near the arctic circle

1093
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,920
yeah you know there's no other ships

1094
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,359
anywhere near me

1095
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,839
all my autonomous defensive systems

1096
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,440
you're good to go because if something

1097
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,960
jumps out around the corner and goes

1098
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,000
surprise happy birthday

1099
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,599
i'm going to hit it with my muscles

1100
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,640
because it scared me

1101
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,680
all right

1102
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,000
so we talked about

1103
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,599
that

1104
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,079
and i blew through my slides much faster

1105
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,119
than expected so with that i'll

1106
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,200
open up for you a few questions uh

1107
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,720
around how we might be able to

1108
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,078
manipulate some ai yeah

1109
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,280
yeah so we're going to go with the red

1110
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,880
dots are kind

1111
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,839
of

1112
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,760
it could be any two categories that are

1113
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,800
there

1114
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,599
they're

1115
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,560
i'm sure everybody's seen a

1116
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,640
face morphing video where it goes from

1117
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,480
this person to this person or this

1118
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,240
person

1119
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,520
it's improved a lot since the old

1120
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,359
michael jackson video

1121
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:26,240
uh

1122
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,480
but you know it's all very continuous

1123
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,640
but and

1124
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,040
if you search for ai generated faces

1125
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,880
you'll just see pages and pages and

1126
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,839
pages

1127
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:36,640
so

1128
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,920
you know previously you know somebody

1129
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,320
was getting catfish they had somebody on

1130
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,160
social media that was trying to hit them

1131
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,400
up and say hey you're cute and i need to

1132
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,880
send me some money or whatever else

1133
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,640
go to google do a reverse image search

1134
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,400
and pop up oh this is actually this

1135
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,079
person

1136
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,000
and it's absolutely not who the person

1137
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,599
that says they are

1138
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,480
now

1139
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,480
i can generate an image of a human

1140
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,720
that's never existed

1141
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,640
but it looks like a real human and now

1142
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,560
that's the profile i'm doing

1143
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,440
oh

1144
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,800
by the way i'm now going to take this

1145
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,400
human that never existed i can start

1146
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,560
creating some bio things around it so

1147
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,920
this is what they did they went to high

1148
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,800
school

1149
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,680
and probably over a period of

1150
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,359
well it depends on how long you can use

1151
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:18,880
it you can build this up over a couple

1152
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,839
years

1153
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,280
maybe even longer

1154
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,760
and yeah well what am i going to do with

1155
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,560
that

1156
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,240
well i've got 10 000 bots now

1157
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,480
post history profile pictures and

1158
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,880
whatever else i'm now going to sell a

1159
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,680
subscription to influencers on instagram

1160
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,920
or whatever if you want 10 000

1161
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,599
additional followers that look really

1162
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,680
really human and won't get

1163
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,839
booted in the next purge great here's my

1164
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,280
monthly rate

1165
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,040
in the meantime i've got

1166
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,880
every month i'm generating another 10

1167
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,800
000 followers so i can continue tearing

1168
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,720
up my pricing

1169
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,520
and

1170
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,960
created i'm treating artificial people

1171
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,520
and they look just like everybody else

1172
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,200
out there they're sharing memes

1173
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,680
look at the last few election seconds

1174
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,040
whether it's in the u.s or abroad the

1175
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,880
number of artificial people that start

1176
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,720
showing up

1177
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,319
and you'll hear like somebody's like oh

1178
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:11,200
you know

1179
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,119
this person was reposting everything

1180
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,680
from this one lady or whatever else

1181
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,000
that wasn't a lady

1182
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,319
it was a dinosaur

1183
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,800
or silicone or something you know but it

1184
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,200
wasn't a real person and they're you're

1185
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,599
able to start pulling in pieces of stuff

1186
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,040
that's realish

1187
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,400
nightmares we go back to when we're

1188
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,599
looking at the game where we had the

1189
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,119
training data

1190
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,880
that was in there it was based off of

1191
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,160
real training data and we started doing

1192
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,319
those comparisons

1193
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,160
and pretty soon

1194
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,240
you know so i had something to look real

1195
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,720
i'm doing the comparisons to it

1196
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,520
and

1197
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,520
it very recently starts to look real

1198
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,560
you and you know the questions for my uh

1199
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,079
the other the other members of the

1200
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,200
triplets here

1201
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:57,920
uh

1202
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,760
i tell people i'm old white guy number

1203
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,680
three from central cast

1204
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,079
because we all look alike

1205
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,319
well you guys are watching

1206
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:07,359
um

1207
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,280
yeah and and if

1208
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,800
you're like well oh

1209
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,480
there's always these subtle differences

1210
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,880
i was at the table in korea with three

1211
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,880
other bald white guys

1212
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,640
and like the waitress just saw us and

1213
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,839
she's like i give up you know

1214
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,760
i we couldn't tell the difference among

1215
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,920
ourselves really easy

1216
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,040
so well but what are those

1217
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,960
distinguishing characteristics that the

1218
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,480
human asks could be their hair their

1219
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,720
colors and their glasses

1220
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,319
great i can have that little part of

1221
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:35,839
what's being generated

1222
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:36,640
and

1223
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,359
unlike a few years ago i can actually

1224
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,440
have it so that person turns their head

1225
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,760
it moves they talk

1226
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,680
their speech pattern their little muscle

1227
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,079
movements on their face those are all

1228
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,359
realistic

1229
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,680
so i can actually generate a video i can

1230
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,359
do a political ad

1231
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,920
testimonials of everybody saying this is

1232
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,520
the person i support you know i did this

1233
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,280
yeah i went to college with this guy

1234
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,720
great guy

1235
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,560
the candidate's not real none of the

1236
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,400
video none of the people in the videos

1237
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,920
were maybe some of the scenes behind

1238
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,200
them are wrong

1239
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,560
but but it's all being generated and

1240
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,160
so what comfortable channels okay i want

1241
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,000
to manipulate the ai so we've got people

1242
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,930
they are going to build people

1243
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:18,880
[Music]

1244
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,960
manipulate people

1245
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,319
probably not yet

1246
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,800
or and how do i help figure out if it's

1247
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,200
a real person

1248
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,119
and it's tough because

1249
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,599
like the video with

1250
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,720
president obama on there

1251
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,000
if you look at it it's like yeah you

1252
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,560
know something the pores aren't right on

1253
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,880
the skin looks a little too smooth

1254
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,359
that was three years ago now

1255
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,280
all of that looks

1256
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,040
absolutely

1257
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,400
real

1258
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,800
and the more training that it has the

1259
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,119
better it is at generating the fake

1260
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:56,960
people or the fake overlay

1261
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,839
for what's going on

1262
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:01,119
which

1263
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,920
and it's our spooky i've got a couple of

1264
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,119
friends they

1265
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,920
built the disinformation

1266
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,480
sock framework

1267
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,640
emmett

1268
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,520
so sj terp and pablo burr

1269
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,319
they put that available they've helped

1270
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,079
build some disinformation socks for

1271
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,760
international organizations that are

1272
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,760
working to try and detect

1273
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,599
when's stuff being manipulated when is

1274
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:27,440
it fake things that are happening what's

1275
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,359
going on is it the ai that's probably

1276
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,280
going to go for my bank account that's

1277
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,599
you know some really cool attack and

1278
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,480
what else most likely not

1279
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,480
is it going to go for a retiring

1280
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,560
relative and be their old buddy from

1281
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,640
high school they haven't talked to for

1282
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,720
50 years 60 years

1283
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,480
yeah quite possibly

1284
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,160
and it can have a whole series of

1285
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,400
pictures for the last 50 or 60 years of

1286
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,560
how he grew up had its family and kids

1287
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,160
and whatever else and none of them are

1288
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,440
real

1289
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,480
and

1290
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,400
i

1291
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,560
you know 10 years ago trying to get

1292
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,640
grandma to quit sending money to nigeria

1293
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,599
and

1294
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:06,960
it was hard

1295
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,480
but what i'm going to do when grandma

1296
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,119
gets her grandpa gets his pictures

1297
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,200
of all the way back to when they were in

1298
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,960
grade school because ai was built from

1299
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,920
that one image in in second grade

1300
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,680
then extrapolated and built his life

1301
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,839
from there

1302
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,440
i don't even have to have somebody in

1303
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,680
nigeria emailing people

1304
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,880
it's even

1305
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,440
even easier to scale with them

1306
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,960
all right

1307
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,200
so i'll go ahead and i will stop for a

1308
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,920
few questions and we will stop the

1309
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,240
recording and i'll do the uh

1310
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,200
um

1311
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,119
the the deep fake of the president's

1312
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,760
doing something

1313
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:56,160
okay any other questions thoughts

1314
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:58,079
okay

1315
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:00,079
make sure you buy a candy bar

1316
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,160
help sponsor her trip

1317
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,680
because

1318
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,680
she sat in the front row and she has

1319
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,560
been

1320
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,400
making sure that every speaker

1321
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,920
acknowledges that she is funding her

1322
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,119
trip

1323
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:11,920
so

1324
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,359
please do so

1325
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,520
and with that can we go ahead and stop

1326
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,240
the recording there

1327
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,480
oh i'm completely focused over here i'm

1328
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,640
not doing anything over here you should

1329
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,880
focus on countering my autonomous

1330
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,960
i have walking robots have you seen the

1331
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,240
uh the boston dynamics how they're

1332
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,440
have you seen the robots doing parkour

1333
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,680
yeah you know it's like it does flip off

1334
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,119
whatever else there's also a

1335
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,359
a parkour bloopers video for boston

1336
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:48,560
dynamics

1337
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,760
and if you're

1338
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,520
a little bit older a little bit less

1339
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,359
agile than you were previously you would

1340
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,280
appreciate the blooper video

1341
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,880
um

1342
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,000
i don't know i was quite happy about

1343
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,920
that but hey every time we you know

1344
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,200
we're showing these systems great you

1345
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,879
know that another piece is

1346
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,800
possibly doing something i think about

1347
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,119
back about you know with the cold war

1348
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:10,880
and there was a lot of information that

1349
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,319
got put out like oh you know we're

1350
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:14,079
really behind the russians and somewhere

1351
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,000
where you know we got these oh we're way

1352
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,599
ahead of stuff we're going to implore

1353
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,319
you

1354
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:19,760
we're going to do star wars we're doing

1355
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,599
lasers in space and it will stop

1356
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:23,599
anything that comes at us do we have the

1357
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:24,960
capability to do that at all

1358
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,040
successfully no that's a third rising

1359
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,800
thing and we're like oh crud they

1360
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,079
panicked they thought we had a third

1361
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,920
resident so we talked about it while i

1362
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,800
did all the other stuff

1363
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,160
yes and um

1364
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,480
i don't recall the numbers but every day

1365
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,319
just it's like terabytes of data going

1366
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,599
back to tesla

1367
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:04,720
and there's something that's been said

1368
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,160
with ai

1369
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,160
that you can have

1370
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,599
a group of yeah

1371
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:14,319
level programmers and a tremendous data

1372
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:17,599
set and you'll have better results

1373
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,480
than a few excellent programmers

1374
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,960
into small data

1375
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,680
once again i messed up somebody's quote

1376
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,440
but i'm not being recorded so that's

1377
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,480
okay

1378
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,040
but yeah so that's that's a big piece uh

1379
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,160
how do i

1380
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,440
you know change that how do i um

1381
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,880
well and then you may see some go with

1382
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,359
ring dormants

1383
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:44,079
and how much information gets

1384
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:45,359
pushed out you know we all see the

1385
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:48,160
little clips or somebody uh fedex or ups

1386
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,240
through the package up there or whatever

1387
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,440
else

1388
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,200
and your bearer walks on passing away

1389
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:53,920
back

1390
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,079
okay but all this data all the time

1391
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,640
keeps getting pushed in there and so

1392
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,319
whether it's amazon or google or

1393
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,079
wherever else they're getting more and

1394
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:05,119
more data about how you how you behave

1395
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,040
how stuff behaves around you

1396
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,800
and and they know if there's a bear in

1397
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,880
your neighborhood

1398
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,480
so it's alexa going to tell me at some

1399
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,280
point

1400
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,720
you know you should use the front door

1401
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,000
there is a bear spotted near your

1402
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,280
backyard

1403
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:18,319
i don't know

1404
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:20,720
in two commands you can give them alexa

1405
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,160
and pretty much every alexa will listen

1406
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,119
to you

1407
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:25,440
say alexa volume one

1408
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,559
alexa play music by the muppets

1409
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,000
and just leave

1410
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,359
you can do that at your friend's house

1411
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,440
you can do it wherever else and you know

1412
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,880
there's that they'll occasionally hear

1413
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,880
this little something phenomenal in the

1414
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,000
background but they don't know where

1415
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,559
it's coming from and they don't know why

1416
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,800
that's my completely evil contribution

1417
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,599
to the days like the volume one alexa

1418
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,760
play music

1419
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,400
um

1420
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,599
so there is more of a combination that's

1421
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,440
happening now where they're taking cyber

1422
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,839
signal the communications the mi for

1423
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,480
electronic warfare and intel and putting

1424
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,559
all these pieces together now you'll

1425
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:33,599
hear it referred to maybe it's

1426
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:35,839
multi-domain operations sometimes it

1427
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,160
changes by which service we're taking a

1428
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,599
bunch of things from the different

1429
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,200
places and we're trying to get them all

1430
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,680
to work together before it was

1431
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,599
the signal people they're doing this

1432
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:47,119
stuff and then the cyber people that are

1433
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:48,240
maybe working on the network they're

1434
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,800
doing this stuff and then the mi folks

1435
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,480
they're over here behind a green door

1436
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,079
not talking to anybody

1437
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:55,599
um

1438
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,280
and so we're forcing those folks to come

1439
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,359
together it's so it's interesting i've

1440
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,200
got one of the

1441
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,880
i've got the probably the largest most

1442
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,960
complex brigade in the army reserve i

1443
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,960
have an airborne company that is part of

1444
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,800
my unit i've got 1600 communicators

1445
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,240
i'm the first commander of that

1446
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,760
organization that's a cyber officer

1447
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,599
instead of a singing officer

1448
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,839
and my counterpart there's two of those

1449
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:19,680
ttsbs the other one's smaller and less

1450
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,240
cool in the reserves

1451
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,839
but they just got another commander and

1452
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:25,599
he's a cyber officer

1453
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,839
so what's really interesting to see is

1454
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:29,920
the these really key senior leadership

1455
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,599
positions

1456
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,040
we may have started a signal and may

1457
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,960
start as mi or whatever else but cyber

1458
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,119
officers are getting put in

1459
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:39,200
to bring a little bit more of that

1460
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,640
broader knowledge and asking those

1461
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,640
broader questions so if you're saying

1462
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,440
that you're actually the person

1463
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,399
all right

1464
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,480
so yeah uh the

1465
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,119
so

1466
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:53,359
in the words of some of my uh friends i

1467
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:56,640
will be talking such things

1468
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,680
so i am

1469
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,359
getting close to being on your time

1470
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,200
there's a little bit unplugged happy to

1471
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,400
have additional conversations later

1472
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,920
afterwards whatever else make sure you

1473
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,040
like anymore

1474
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:11,839
and

1475
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:15,480
thank you all very much
