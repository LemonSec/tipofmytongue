1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,399
well thank you so much for having me

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,400
here today with all of you it is

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,879
absolutely a pleasure i have to say that

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,280
this is my first time ever

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,000
in iowa so um

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,679
very i know it's very cool i've been

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,519
wanting to come to horncon for a couple

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,920
of years and with nile

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,039
with

10
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,199
coded that sort of made it a little bit

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,960
challenging last year we did a digital

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,000
event

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,920
with all of you

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,599
we're going to be talking today about

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,960
emotional intelligence i think the last

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,480
17 months for everybody has taken a toll

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,360
on

18
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,920
all of our emotional psyches we have

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,680
been going

20
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,440
in different directions

21
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,520
we have been disrupted

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,440
our work style

23
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,559
work mantra and how we're connecting

24
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,000
with our colleagues and teammates and

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,399
even our just our companies in general

26
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,559
have completely changed

27
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,640
what has always been amazing to me is

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,520
how the cyber security professionals by

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,479
nature are really just determined

30
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,439
and incredibly intelligent people

31
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,600
they're really you guys are quick

32
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,360
thinkers as well

33
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,600
but because you guys are pattern

34
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,540
oriented and um

35
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,799
[Music]

36
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,080
and very analytical and sometimes

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,840
uh introvert

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,960
overall

39
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,439
the other side of the coin of your brain

40
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,439
emotional intelligence doesn't

41
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,360
necessarily

42
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,000
come naturally for cyber security

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,439
professionals

44
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,720
and that's what i'm going to be talking

45
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,880
to you a little bit about today

46
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,920
so one of the things that i've seen as a

47
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,159
being in this profession for

48
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,159
this industry i should say for

49
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,880
over two decades i'm not going to date

50
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,720
myself i have a whole little group of

51
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,799
friends in the front row that pre-date

52
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,520
me even more just kidding

53
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,799
see if they're listening they didn't

54
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,280
even notice

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,040
um but understanding really how

56
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,119
the different generational aspects of

57
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,000
our

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,159
our cyber security professionals are we

59
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,479
have a whole young group of

60
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,479
future cyber security professionals

61
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,959
there here from the local schools and

62
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,400
then certainly

63
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,440
um

64
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,879
the ones that are

65
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,360
up and coming and of course the ones

66
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,760
that are more established in leadership

67
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,680
the hardest thing that i have always

68
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,800
found is

69
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,280
harnessing emotional intelligence

70
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,040
and being able to practice it on a

71
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,599
regular basis again it's just not

72
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,519
something intrinsic to

73
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,680
cyber security and technology type of

74
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,760
professionals but

75
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,800
i think

76
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,120
as we kind of look at it it's a lot more

77
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,160
easier than we all thought and kind of

78
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,200
give it some practice

79
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,560
so let's just sort of talk through some

80
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,280
terminology so we all get on the same

81
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,560
page

82
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,159
and what defines emotional intelligence

83
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,400
first you have

84
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,080
self-awareness

85
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,840
and that's really just about knowing

86
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,840
your strengths your weaknesses

87
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,680
your drivers

88
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,519
your values

89
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,720
and how

90
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,080
you impact

91
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,440
others

92
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,080
you have to stay aware of your emotions

93
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,560
on an individual level

94
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,040
then you have self-regulation

95
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,720
and this is really about

96
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,120
your ability to control

97
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,599
and redirect disruptive impulses and

98
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,959
moods as well as

99
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,239
manage behaviors and tendencies

100
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,680
social skills

101
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,920
something that's not always natural for

102
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,879
cyber security professionals but

103
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,120
there's always a connection your ability

104
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,799
to build a rapport

105
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,440
with others that have desired

106
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,200
common interests

107
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,519
and you really understand how

108
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,959
what or

109
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,519
what motivates you uh in the quality of

110
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,760
those relationships

111
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,439
then of course you have

112
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,280
empathy

113
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,720
and applying that

114
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,159
and i think that's probably the most

115
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,439
important thing about emotional

116
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,840
intelligence is really the empathy

117
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,959
factor

118
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,480
is the ability to understand

119
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,000
the other person's emotional makeup so

120
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,478
we're turning that table around and

121
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:17,358
saying

122
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:20,720
what would i do if i were in their shoes

123
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,600
and then reacting in such a manner

124
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,759
so it's really reflective of moods and

125
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,240
feelings because it really helps with

126
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,440
building your trust and connections

127
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,240
and then of course you have motivation

128
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,639
which is really your personal drive to

129
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,759
improve

130
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,639
your common goals your achievements

131
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,440
and really is taking initiatives on

132
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,479
um it's being optimistic as well

133
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,160
and more importantly

134
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,040
in today's post-private world it's about

135
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,800
being resilient

136
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,720
but being motivated and staying

137
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,520
motivated is really

138
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,120
the biggest challenge

139
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,560
and certainly motivating others

140
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,280
so

141
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,000
let's start to talk about the new normal

142
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,479
and the great resignation

143
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,880
the new normal i know all of us kind of

144
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,960
hate that word because what was normal

145
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,919
before and versus normal now and

146
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,600
all that so i know it's a bit of a

147
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,199
cliche

148
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,600
but cyber security professionals

149
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,320
have really as i mentioned been viewed

150
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,039
as an introverted individual

151
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,360
who used their

152
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,840
their other intelligence

153
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,400
to build their knowledge and fight

154
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,919
cybercrime

155
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,360
the typical movie image or stereotype of

156
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,320
a cyber security professional is that

157
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,639
person in the black hoodie

158
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,600
kind of dark against the bright screen

159
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
and just sort of looking there by

160
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,199
themselves

161
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,600
but with a pandemic

162
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,120
that image

163
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,479
quite frankly

164
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,560
was all of us at different points in

165
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,520
time

166
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,160
sitting in front of the computer screen

167
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,240
talking to our colleagues trying to stay

168
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,560
connected with our families but at the

169
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,520
end of the day lacking human contact and

170
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,319
being somewhat isolated

171
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,120
a lot of folks developed anxiety

172
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,600
and depression definitely rose because

173
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,440
of the isolation and the lack of human

174
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,600
contact

175
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,720
as leaders we've had to look at things

176
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,960
in different ways

177
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,520
as a ceo of a company that was already

178
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,000
actually a virtual company to begin with

179
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,560
but delivered in person events

180
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,479
i had a look at different ways of

181
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,280
staying connected with my

182
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,639
my staff

183
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,120
my customers and the executives that

184
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,360
participated in our programs

185
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,919
we actually had to build out a whole new

186
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,960
platform of digital programs that was

187
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,960
not our core competency that took us

188
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,160
through

189
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,319
a lot of change and

190
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,880
transformation as a company but it was

191
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,199
key to our survival

192
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,680
people at large really reflect

193
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,400
you know at this time uh

194
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,840
like myself

195
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,960
and how

196
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,960
they had to

197
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,720
view the world

198
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,360
just this morning um

199
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,360
much like the great resignations that

200
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,160
are out there i lost my first employee

201
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,280
in the pandemic to the great resignation

202
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,919
she decided that her calling was not

203
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,520
being in cyber security but helping to

204
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,400
oversee a communications department in a

205
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,240
cancer organization a healthcare company

206
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,919
and i'm sad

207
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,919
at the end of the day that she's not

208
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,000
going to be at our team anymore but i

209
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,120
also

210
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,599
was struck by the fact that

211
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,599
she took the opportunity because she

212
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:48,879
lost both

213
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,599
her grandparents to cancer and this was

214
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,639
her way

215
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,879
of helping to perhaps

216
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,440
communicate and prevent cancer

217
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,840
or cure cancer down the road

218
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,160
so what i've seen just across the board

219
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,199
on the great resignation front

220
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,240
is

221
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,639
a lot of people had a lot of time to

222
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,199
reflect

223
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,160
and really decide

224
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,319
what their calling might be and it could

225
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,800
be something completely different

226
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,800
at the end of the day

227
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,400
so this is going to be the challenge

228
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,000
moving forward and kind of the

229
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
conditions that we're working with

230
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,440
because

231
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,520
as we're seeing one-third of the workers

232
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,840
under 40 have considered changing

233
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,479
careers during the pandemic

234
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,519
17 of the adults have already located

235
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,839
their homes and i really actually think

236
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,440
that number's probably even higher

237
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,279
because i actually are probably one of

238
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,360
the last standing original neighbors in

239
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,200
my neighborhood and i've lived there

240
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,760
since 1999

241
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,800
um

242
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,959
and i lived in georgia and

243
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,920
also 55 of the workers

244
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,320
wanted to return to the workplace

245
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,440
um

246
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,120
but many of them don't

247
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,560
many have found

248
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,320
for variety reasons that working

249
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,800
remotely suits their lifestyle they're

250
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,399
not having to drive

251
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,080
two plus hours commuting

252
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,080
and now we have a

253
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,160
mandate for businesses over a hundred

254
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,680
more people

255
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,160
that has been posed as of yesterday

256
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,959
to

257
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,000
be vaccinated or be tested once a week

258
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,160
so for a lot of people

259
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,399
a lot of decision making

260
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,640
is occurring and a lot of change is

261
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,040
happening at the end of the day as it

262
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,640
comes back to

263
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,320
whether or not we work in person

264
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,839
together as a team

265
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,959
is it possible to work virtually i not

266
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,120
need all that expensive office space or

267
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,279
all that travel or

268
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,360
is it really suitable for the company

269
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,399
and their culture to work in person

270
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,760
and i think we're going to have some

271
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,760
real challenges ahead

272
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,320
because i did spoke at a conference uh

273
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,399
infosec nashville just a couple of weeks

274
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,519
ago

275
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,279
and a couple of the employers there

276
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,440
talked about bringing back the folks to

277
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,800
the office

278
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,120
and they basically have another great

279
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,279
set of resignations because

280
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,720
they didn't want to go back to the

281
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,760
office

282
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,519
and then i've heard

283
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,480
from other people they miss the contact

284
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,839
with people

285
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,240
so again as leaders

286
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,920
and employers

287
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,760
teammates we've got to be really

288
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,640
thoughtful and work with each of us to

289
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,640
apply empathy to understand what's

290
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,880
really right and what the new workforce

291
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,040
is going to look for look like in cyber

292
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,599
security

293
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,600
so talking through

294
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,240
leadership i think leadership

295
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,640
is a journey we're not born

296
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,000
natural leaders we're not born as a team

297
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,720
lead we're not born as a ceo

298
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,720
we grow to become those leaders

299
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,519
i see some common characteristics though

300
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,040
that what makes us successful leaders

301
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,120
first and foremost it's really

302
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,880
understanding your the business that

303
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,279
you're working for the most successful

304
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,440
chief information security officers that

305
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,320
i've ever worked aside with or along

306
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,320
with i should say are the ones that have

307
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,000
an understanding

308
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,880
a full understanding it could be the ceo

309
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
of the companies in which

310
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,000
they're running the security

311
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,760
organizations for

312
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,560
in that they understand that security

313
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,959
can be a business driver a business

314
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,839
enabler a business differentiator as

315
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,160
well as a competitive advantage

316
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,320
so getting your team ready for those

317
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,240
types of things

318
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,399
so having an understanding of how

319
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,040
you as a security professional can add

320
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,440
value to your company's

321
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,040
supply chain

322
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,399
or

323
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,279
e-commerce operations

324
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,200
all those types of things

325
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,399
for your manufacturing process

326
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,880
the management of the team doesn't mean

327
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,680
just being a task master and a micro

328
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,959
manager

329
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,639
and just saying hey did you get your

330
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,839
work done

331
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,880
my least favorite type of manager

332
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,839
is

333
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,079
ones that call you at five o'clock on a

334
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,639
friday afternoon and say

335
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,920
what are you doing right now

336
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,279
it's true right you hated those people

337
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,360
don't be one of those people

338
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,240
i always have when i had the opportunity

339
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,920
to run my own company

340
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,600
and lead my own team

341
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,360
i would never call an employee on a

342
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,040
friday afternoon and say what are you

343
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,480
doing right now

344
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,240
if i were to call them because i needed

345
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,760
to talk to them

346
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,279
i certainly would be hoping that they

347
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,040
would be wrapping up their things to

348
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,040
have a good weekend

349
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,560
unless there was a special set of

350
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,360
circumstances that had otherwise but not

351
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,959
for the sake of working

352
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,320
we have to build reports with our team

353
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,560
and that's really hard right now when

354
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,959
you are looking at a zoom screen for

355
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,519
eight hours a day or longer in different

356
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,399
time zones and everything like that

357
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,240
we met i do miss

358
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,320
a lot of the in-person interactions and

359
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,480
actually that's why i'm so glad when the

360
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,720
opportunity came to be here with all of

361
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,720
you today was i've missed the in person

362
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,200
as well but what i've also had to learn

363
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,760
in this journey is

364
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,800
how to

365
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,399
stay connected

366
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,279
in a digital world

367
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,200
so one of the things that i've always

368
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,959
returned to and i think this is a

369
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,800
security professionals really is

370
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,839
important

371
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,480
is we go back to the basics when in

372
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,480
doubt you always return to the

373
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,639
fundamentals when you're building your

374
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,399
security stack

375
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,320
and you're looking at it you have to

376
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,000
always know from the bottom up and go

377
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,519
back to the core

378
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,519
and the fundamentals

379
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,040
it's no different

380
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,120
as a team and apply emotional

381
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,199
intelligence

382
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,079
applying this aspect of self-awareness

383
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,880
so here's some tips for you first and

384
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,399
foremost

385
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,399
ask for feedback

386
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,000
ask hey how am i doing for you

387
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,440
not in a looking for affirmation or

388
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,920
self-affirmation or anything like that

389
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,720
but ask how could i be helping you as a

390
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,360
team leader or a team member to do

391
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,920
better for you

392
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,399
and then kind of take those positives

393
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,000
and ask for the positives and the

394
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,760
negatives

395
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,480
be conscious of their weaknesses

396
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,279
and take the constructive criticism

397
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,760
when you need to have it with open arms

398
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,600
and i know

399
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,279
that's one of the hardest things i've

400
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,399
had to do

401
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,600
as a

402
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,760
team a ceo

403
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,680
as well as being on the other side of

404
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,600
the coin

405
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,600
taking it personally can be really

406
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,880
really hard

407
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,920
um

408
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,839
so you have to someone feel a little bit

409
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,199
of thick skin

410
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,360
and the way you deliver constructive

411
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,680
criticism is not to be

412
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,320
hurtful or mean

413
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,680
but rather

414
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,120
helpful

415
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,000
and positive

416
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,720
look about the the hardest thing i think

417
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,920
was one of the hardest things with the

418
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,600
pandemic is the separation between

419
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,360
work and life

420
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,680
and life and work

421
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,160
a lot of us worked

422
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,639
always in an office in a smaller and

423
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,560
then had a smaller dwelling like people

424
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,399
that lived in let's say new york city or

425
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:31,920
san francisco

426
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,079
they may not have had a need for a

427
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,720
separate workspace but suddenly with the

428
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,880
pandemic you're working at your kitchen

429
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,320
table you're sitting in your bedroom

430
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,440
and

431
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,480
you really don't have a delineation

432
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,320
and that's really hard that was one of

433
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,959
the things that even though i had been

434
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,480
working from home

435
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,959
but as john talked about i was a total

436
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,079
road warrior so i had a delineation

437
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,120
between

438
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,560
going to something and then coming back

439
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,639
i think for me one of the hardest things

440
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,480
even though i set up a summer i had a

441
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,880
separate workspace and how to completely

442
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,240
redesign it

443
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,720
so that it became a zoom studio

444
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,800
i had to make sure that the lighting for

445
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,920
example

446
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,880
um did not was not behind me i had my

447
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,720
big picture window behind me and i loved

448
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,920
that but it didn't work for a zoo call

449
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,880
because it blacked out my face

450
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,600
and having good lighting and good

451
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,160
posture and sitting in a chair because

452
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,800
it's hard sitting in a chair for

453
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,399
several hours a day

454
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,399
so you have to have something good to

455
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,720
sit on not just at your kitchen table

456
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,600
i at the beginning of time i will tell

457
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,959
you

458
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,720
i would be on a zoom several zoom calls

459
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,600
and then be physically exhausted

460
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,440
afterwards and just go to the couch and

461
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,680
just pass out and this is the same

462
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,560
person that would get on an airplane

463
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,560
for 7 am flight

464
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,559
fly across the country

465
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,039
delivered an isd private dinner on the

466
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,119
west coast so that would have been

467
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,400
getting to the restaurant um at 8 30 at

468
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,520
night

469
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,919
uh because they start at 5 30 at night

470
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,160
whatever times they were doing and then

471
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,240
coming back at 11 30

472
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,359
um my body clock time and going back and

473
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,199
then getting up again the next morning

474
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,839
and flying on a plane at six o'clock

475
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,080
seven o'clock in the morning so that i

476
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,080
could get back to the east coast by two

477
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,679
o'clock in the afternoon and not lose an

478
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,600
entire day

479
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,400
the same person could not handle being

480
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,520
on a zoo call for several hours because

481
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,679
i thought it was more exhausting

482
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,360
so i had to really look at the

483
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,640
fundamentals

484
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,559
and how to structure and delineate

485
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:49,679
between

486
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,320
day and night work

487
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,160
work and life

488
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,640
and that was really hard

489
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,240
some other things that i really learned

490
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,520
about

491
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,360
going back to the fundamentals but

492
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,120
having to communicate on a digital

493
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,400
platform

494
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,320
was being really cognizant of your

495
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,160
expressions

496
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,799
you can't just

497
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,679
that was you can't really roll your eyes

498
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:14,960
or

499
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,360
you can't just the whole aspect of the

500
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,679
body language and the chemistry doesn't

501
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,280
always come back to look at you because

502
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,240
you're just seeing maybe your head

503
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,160
with a you know a zoom background or

504
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,919
something like that

505
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,080
so it's harder to kind of gauge those

506
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,160
reactions

507
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,559
you also i also found it to be really

508
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,919
difficult

509
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,160
to be on camera all the time because you

510
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,640
had to be on and it was very hard to

511
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,679
look down and do your work or take notes

512
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,480
because your laptop was also the device

513
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,640
that you were taking notes on

514
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,400
so you really had to change how you were

515
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,520
working

516
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,000
and communicating and participating in a

517
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,400
meeting without looking like you weren't

518
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
paying attention or care

519
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,600
and that

520
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,799
for a lot of folks is really hard to do

521
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,400
you have to really think about

522
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,480
practicing self-control

523
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,200
because again there's a barrier in terms

524
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,760
of how you're working um you're not at

525
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,600
the same meeting table so you can't just

526
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,679
get up and walk to the other side and

527
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,840
show somebody on the computer you have

528
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,039
to do something like a screen share

529
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,750
but one of the things i will say

530
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,080
[Music]

531
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,960
and my friends over there that table

532
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,440
always will say about me i always like

533
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,760
to look at a glass half full

534
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,240
versus half empty you have to look at

535
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,120
life

536
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,520
at the positives versus the negatives

537
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,880
because that's one of the things about

538
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,840
self-regulation and how you're going to

539
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,760
continue to stay motivated and motivate

540
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,640
the others the other folks around you

541
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,200
and that's really something i really

542
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,440
work in heart work hard to strive for

543
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,000
every single day

544
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,600
um

545
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,320
does it think is it say uh when in doubt

546
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,640
return

547
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,039
okay sorry i can't see what's up on the

548
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,520
screen and my i don't have my glasses on

549
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,559
so the slide on my thing is very small

550
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,280
okay

551
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,280
awesome thank you very much

552
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,799
one of the things i've also learned

553
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,280
about staying motivated

554
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,679
is really setting measurable goals that

555
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,679
are reasonable to obtain

556
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,000
it's really easy to become very

557
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,480
overwhelmed about things when you just

558
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,880
have this huge horizon

559
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,280
looking out and you feel like you can't

560
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,799
get anything done

561
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,480
one of the things that i've noticed in

562
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,120
the cyber security world just in general

563
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,039
around especially security

564
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,280
uh stock analysts for example

565
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,559
are those that are

566
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,720
dealing with all the alerts

567
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,799
is the challenge and feeling of anything

568
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,200
getting accomplished and the importance

569
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,600
of actually automation

570
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,799
in in the stock to help prevent this

571
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,679
fatigue that comes with it

572
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,919
people just inherently

573
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,360
have to feel like you've accomplished

574
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,480
something

575
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,120
to get something the next part done

576
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,640
even if it's something simple just

577
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,480
checking off your checklist

578
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,520
but with a very fast-paced environment

579
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,000
that has a lot of or lack thereof of

580
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,280
automation

581
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,679
that fatigue can really step in into

582
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:26,640
play

583
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,320
and you're end up chasing a lot of

584
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,880
squirrels instead of putting out a lot

585
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,440
of fires

586
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,960
another thing

587
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,880
and i know many of you guys know this

588
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,480
from being a part of our isd awards over

589
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
the years and we're going to be bringing

590
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,520
them back in 2022 and we kicked off our

591
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,919
nominations so for those of you

592
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,520
that have uh

593
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,760
some projects that you've been kind of

594
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,559
storing up and obviously leadership

595
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,280
uh celebrating your results is the best

596
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,480
way

597
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,120
to really honor and respect your team

598
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,960
and all the hard work that you guys have

599
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,840
done

600
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,559
especially during this time period

601
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,480
but it's important to take a step back

602
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,559
and reflect

603
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,440
on your on what has been accomplished

604
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,799
i look at

605
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,200
um

606
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,720
you know back

607
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,600
so

608
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,039
march

609
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,000
5th

610
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,880
2020 our last isd private dinner um

611
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,440
was in nashville tennessee

612
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,480
and there's a lot of health care there

613
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,640
we had a lot of cancellations

614
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,880
of cyber security executives that were

615
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,480
in healthcare space

616
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,760
because they were trying to figure out

617
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,720
what the heck was going on

618
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,000
but there are a lot of them that still

619
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,280
did come

620
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,600
and they're all just sitting there

621
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,280
dumbfounded

622
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,760
and i have to get

623
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,640
our company up and running remotely

624
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,360
in 48 hours or less

625
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,600
oh my god and we are not a remote

626
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,520
company by nature

627
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,240
and the stress level for that

628
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,080
was unbelievable

629
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,360
and people

630
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,720
figured it out

631
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,200
they worked tirelessly

632
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,000
and

633
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,679
take a moment now

634
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,600
you know to reflect

635
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,880
and perfect

636
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,400
but celebrate those results

637
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,280
at the end of the day having tangible

638
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,880
rewards out there

639
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,559
is really

640
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,640
is important because

641
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,120
you really have to

642
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,480
you have to look at it from a

643
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,720
perspective that we are somewhat

644
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,799
operating in an intangible world right

645
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,320
now

646
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,080
it's really about

647
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,840
being motivated

648
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,360
and really being

649
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,200
figuring out what those personal rewards

650
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,279
might be

651
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,679
tell a friend or co-worker really

652
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,760
how you're going to get something done

653
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,840
and then follow up

654
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,320
that you got it done or in reverse they

655
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,480
tell you something like that

656
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,640
and take the time to send a quick text

657
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,480
and say hey how did it go today

658
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,279
the hardest thing i also found during

659
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,720
this time period

660
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,360
is keeping your team motivated

661
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,840
in the darkest of dark times

662
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,600
during the early days of the pandemic

663
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,600
i have to tell you i was

664
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,000
scared

665
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,880
um i did not know a lot about digital

666
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,159
events

667
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,880
they were kind of daunting to me

668
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,159
i've never really been on camera before

669
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,080
and i had never even had a zoom account

670
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,000
opening that first time of that free

671
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,640
zoom account

672
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,559
i don't know it was

673
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,960
both frightening and exhilarating so

674
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,679
i reached out to some girlfriends

675
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,400
and said hey let's have a zoom cocktail

676
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,400
hour so i sat out of my big deck in the

677
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,960
backyard with some wine and cheese

678
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,440
on a friday afternoon i'm like i have to

679
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,279
learn this product

680
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,520
if i'm going to survive as a company as

681
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,120
a ceo

682
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,000
and and pretend to move forward so we

683
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
just talk to each other and zoom i have

684
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,880
never

685
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,760
done a video from poland that ever

686
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,919
all of our conference calls have been at

687
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,240
that to that point were really just what

688
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,279
they were

689
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,679
conference calls

690
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,200
my team

691
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,960
probably was equally as frightened and

692
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,200
they were looking to me

693
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,559
for leadership

694
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,440
encouragement

695
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,600
and that was something hard to do

696
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,199
because i didn't know where i was going

697
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,360
if it wasn't for my husband

698
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,279
who just kind of looked me in the eye

699
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,039
and said you're going to pick yourself

700
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,320
up and do it

701
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,840
we wouldn't have done it

702
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,400
we had google calling

703
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,600
us a little 14-person company that is

704
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,880
comprised of women asking us for

705
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,960
digital round tables

706
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,960
and some type of

707
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,320
whatnot

708
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,440
um

709
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,159
we figured it out we sold them

710
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,240
10 of them

711
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,120
and we were doing digital

712
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,120
well we called them i see cocktails and

713
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,880
conversations

714
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,799
and we even got google to do it on the

715
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,559
zoo

716
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:19,279
so

717
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,520
encouraging your team

718
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,440
and being a leader in the darkest of

719
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,960
times

720
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,720
without really

721
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,320
seeing a horizon

722
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,799
is a true test of leadership

723
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,120
but i also throughout the time

724
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,320
encouraged my team for self-care

725
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,400
so there was an opportunity

726
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,559
after they might there might have been

727
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,919
was shut down

728
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,640
what was like in georgia we ran over to

729
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,799
america first so we were able to get

730
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,559
some of the first haircuts

731
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:51,360
in his mail appointments in the country

732
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,080
it was a big deal let me tell you so

733
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,159
i know but you have a bunch of women

734
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,679
that work for you these are kind of

735
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:58,880
important things

736
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,600
um but in all seriousness i said if you

737
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,279
can get an appointment to go get your

738
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,400
hair cut

739
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,400
you go get a haircut at two o'clock in

740
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,080
the afternoon and you're not taking any

741
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,480
pto just make sure

742
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,039
that your meeting your clients are still

743
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,720
taking or your teammates know what's

744
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,480
happening so that they can make sure

745
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,240
that you enjoy that haircut when you

746
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,240
enjoy that nail salon appointment and

747
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,159
you go do it

748
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,320
and actually i think at the end of the

749
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,279
day they appreciated that because they

750
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,880
didn't have to

751
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,039
take a saturday a coveted saturday

752
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,480
appointment they could just go on a

753
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,559
wednesday afternoon at two o'clock i

754
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,760
didn't really care

755
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,080
and in all fairness i was so happy i

756
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,080
called rob my hair guy

757
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,799
hairdresser roger and he was like sure

758
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,159
i'm happy to give you an appointment

759
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,480
that's not needed at that time because

760
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,240
he had other customers that really did

761
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,440
need a saturday appointment

762
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,240
so talking through some of the social

763
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,240
skills

764
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,120
again inherently

765
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,120
cyber security technology people are not

766
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,320
social my first time going to an issa

767
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,279
meeting

768
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,360
in atlanta

769
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,240
and i'm an outgoing kind of marketing

770
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,840
communications person i'm very

771
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,559
comfortable speaking to all of you today

772
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,240
i was and i loved networking and built

773
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,520
i mean i called my company a

774
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,440
relationship marketing company

775
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,520
so i come into the room

776
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,000
and there i am everyone's sitting down

777
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,840
during especially the networking hour

778
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,080
eating a sound they're little sandwiches

779
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,080
waiting for the presentation to start

780
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,399
and they were doing that for a full hour

781
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:35,679
and i'm so

782
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:36,960
i was stunned

783
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,720
that they would not talk to each other

784
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,559
and go from tape they just sat at their

785
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,399
little tables their classroom style

786
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,960
tables i should say it just didn't talk

787
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,720
to anybody didn't talk with the person

788
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,159
next to him

789
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,480
so i just kind of went around because i

790
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,559
really didn't want a sandwich i started

791
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,399
around and started shaking everybody's

792
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,080
hands and saying hello and introducing

793
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,600
myself

794
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,559
so

795
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,840
you kind of have to go outside of your

796
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,760
comfort zone too to do some of those

797
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,840
things and i don't mean it in a mean way

798
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,960
but actually

799
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,720
some of them started to get up started

800
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,880
to talk to each other after

801
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,799
we kind of i went through and sort of

802
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,200
said hello and then the next time i

803
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,360
attended one of their meetings

804
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,440
i actually saw them sort of not sitting

805
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,279
down and started to talk to each other

806
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,120
unfortunately zoom

807
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,640
right now doesn't allow for a lot of

808
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,120
that stuff but what i would encourage

809
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,080
you to do is to chat with each other in

810
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,720
the chat window and have a sort of side

811
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,080
conversation

812
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,919
not to be a distraction if there's

813
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,159
something going on but just use it as an

814
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,960
alternate way to ask a question or say

815
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,520
something that might not be needed to be

816
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,600
set could be should be said

817
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,480
in the team meeting

818
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,720
one of the hardest things to do

819
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,679
in

820
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,120
on zoom

821
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,600
is really having good eye contact and

822
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,679
active listening skills

823
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,120
so it can be done in video meetings but

824
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,080
really

825
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,960
focus it you have to think about how you

826
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,760
were

827
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,919
again taking those notes how you are

828
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,120
engaging

829
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,760
um how you look on camera

830
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,880
but also there might be times when

831
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,640
you don't need to be on camera and you

832
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,480
can actually have a normal conversation

833
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,320
and not be something out of the jetsons

834
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,960
ask folks questions

835
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,919
not yes or no but open-ended

836
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,080
so that you get a better understanding

837
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,840
and a perspective of what they're

838
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,880
thinking and how they're approaching it

839
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,039
my favorite part again

840
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,279
of emotional intelligence is applying

841
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,200
empathy

842
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,760
as everyone knows that knows me i love

843
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,720
shoes

844
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,960
so i have lots of shoes

845
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,720
and that's something of a bit of a

846
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,520
fetish or mine but what i'll do when i'm

847
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,399
thinking about it is put myself

848
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,799
in somebody else's shoes

849
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,440
so how would they like to be talked to

850
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,080
how would they like to be considered

851
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,440
so in the situation right now with my

852
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,200
communications director leaving us

853
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,799
we are going to have a team meeting on

854
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,120
monday morning to figure out the next

855
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,039
steps before to chart the course

856
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,159
together

857
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,279
because

858
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,039
me just saying i'm going to bring in a

859
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,120
new hire i don't know if that's right

860
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,279
for us i need to hear what they have to

861
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,120
say and how they want to move forward

862
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,720
we're going to certainly

863
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,960
miss the persons their leader their

864
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,399
their team leader

865
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,240
but at the same time

866
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,240
they've been part of my company

867
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,120
for

868
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,880
many many years

869
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,600
so i feel like their voice matters and i

870
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,200
have to apply the empathy and hear what

871
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,559
they have to say help us chart forward

872
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:47,840
try to do

873
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,600
weekly check-ins with your colleagues

874
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,279
don't call them as i said at five

875
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,120
o'clock on friday go what are you doing

876
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,240
right now

877
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,200
but

878
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,960
have a moment just trying to set some

879
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,000
time aside to say hello or send a quick

880
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,200
text

881
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,679
it just helps for them to stay connected

882
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:06,720
also

883
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,600
be

884
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,320
don't be colds in stone

885
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,399
share a little bit of your feelings tell

886
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:16,159
them not overshare but certainly

887
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:17,760
if they're something that they're coming

888
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,960
to you

889
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,880
and they want to talk to you about

890
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,440
apply that everything to them

891
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,440
so i always feel like you always have to

892
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,279
when in doubt return to the fundamentals

893
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,080
so

894
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,000
what about now

895
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,159
you have people fluctuating

896
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,919
they want to stay home they want to work

897
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,760
in the office

898
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,320
their children are

899
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,880
kind of in zoom no land or

900
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,640
purgatory as well

901
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,919
they might have

902
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,640
sports but they're on lockdown from

903
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,760
school

904
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,200
and then you're trying to juggle a

905
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,039
million things and figure out your work

906
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,000
day and all that

907
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,039
people also are missing human contact

908
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,480
they're missing just seeing a

909
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,399
face-to-face smile

910
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,559
and the biggest thing i know i missed

911
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,799
during all this is hugs and i got a lot

912
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,880
of hugs last night and i got a lot of

913
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,159
hugs today

914
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,519
so get my code up in

915
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,360
but the lack of human contact with

916
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,240
people has taken a toll on people

917
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,559
and we can't forget that at the end of

918
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,679
the day

919
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,320
so this is where emotional intelligence

920
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,880
becomes even more important than it did

921
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,279
let's say pre-pandemic

922
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:35,039
you really have to be extra cognizant of

923
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,519
voiced intonations

924
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,360
and how you are

925
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,279
coming across

926
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,679
what you're doing on camera or not doing

927
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,519
on camera

928
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,640
and then just trying to stay connected

929
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,760
so

930
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,240
overall

931
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,600
you're going to have to go a little bit

932
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,240
harder and a little bit extra to stay

933
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,840
connected with your teammates and

934
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,840
colleagues

935
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,919
and do so in a non-obtrusive manner

936
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,039
so check up and check in and

937
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,760
a lot has changed since 20 the beginning

938
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,199
of 2020.

939
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,800
um

940
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,960
give yourself an honest emotional

941
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,399
intelligence checkup as well

942
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,480
despite some of the hardships and

943
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,280
changes that we've had in 2020

944
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,280
take a moment to say hey

945
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,800
what did i do well in 2020

946
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,399
or some new skills that i might have

947
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,399
developed

948
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,040
what about my team

949
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,159
in 2020 as i talked about earlier i

950
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,000
really wasn't necessarily comfortable

951
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,839
being on camera

952
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,560
well that is pretty much what i do a lot

953
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,440
of the day for our digital events

954
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,199
i'm so comfortable with it i've been

955
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,040
doing news interviews and different

956
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,960
things like that

957
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,560
that's a new skill that i probably

958
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,399
wouldn't have had if cobia did not

959
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:57,920
happen

960
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,320
so look at the positives remember look

961
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,960
at that glass half full

962
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,359
emotional intelligence

963
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,839
is not something you just sort of

964
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,560
pop in and pop out of it

965
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,400
what i have to say is you have to think

966
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,920
about it daily so that or apply it daily

967
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,320
so that it becomes natural in an

968
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,720
inherent part of you

969
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,680
i

970
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,240
did not realize all that at first when i

971
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,760
started thinking about emotional

972
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,480
intelligence actually back in 2018 when

973
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,240
i was first asked by eric perimeter who

974
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,280
uh

975
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,599
of icmcp

976
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,880
and

977
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,640
he said marcy i think you should do a

978
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,720
presentation for our conference on

979
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,240
emotional intelligence and i said

980
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,720
emotional what and i didn't really know

981
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,640
anything about it

982
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,400
so i

983
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,640
went to amazon like everyone does didn't

984
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,880
go to the library anymore and bought a

985
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,480
bunch of books

986
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,160
and i was like well some of this is just

987
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,160
so common sense and i already do a lot

988
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,560
of it and then actually some of it was

989
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,240
just kind of thinking about it from a

990
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,839
perspective of

991
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,000
it makes a lot of sense

992
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,760
so here we are

993
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,520
several years later

994
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,440
and i have to tell you

995
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,839
that i tell people that i live and die

996
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,560
by emotional intelligence i think about

997
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,920
how i interact with people

998
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,400
in a manner and how i'm going to present

999
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,440
myself

1000
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,839
or work with my

1001
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:28,800
through using emotional intelligence

1002
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,640
emotional intelligence

1003
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:35,440
still stands strong in 2021 and

1004
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,000
it's really about

1005
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,880
its mental health and applying it in

1006
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,079
such a way

1007
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,079
as we carry forward it can make a world

1008
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,040
of difference for you

1009
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,240
before you

1010
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,640
go out to a difficult conversation or a

1011
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,599
meeting or a positive one

1012
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,960
take a moment to reflect and say

1013
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,720
what does this mean for the other person

1014
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,119
that i'm about to share this news with

1015
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,920
and how do i want to deliver it

1016
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,839
obviously a natural thing of being

1017
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,040
excited

1018
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,720
is awesome but you can't run down the

1019
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,119
office necessarily for some folks right

1020
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,280
now and some folks may never go back to

1021
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,760
the office so think about a way of how

1022
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,200
to deliver

1023
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,640
both positive

1024
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,079
neutral

1025
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,440
and negative news so also think about

1026
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,880
the impact that you have in other

1027
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,640
people's lives

1028
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,400
and i'll say from the poet maya angelou

1029
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,000
i've learned that people will forget

1030
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,920
what you said

1031
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,000
and people will forget what you did but

1032
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,680
people will never forget

1033
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,680
how you made them feel and those are

1034
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,119
some very strong

1035
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,240
words overall

1036
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,400
i have to believe that

1037
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,880
you stand out as empathetic to

1038
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,520
when you're an employer and a leader

1039
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,599
i've learned more about being

1040
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:54,720
a leader

1041
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,079
in the last

1042
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,400
17 months than i probably could have

1043
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,880
ever learned in all the time i was at

1044
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,200
madison college

1045
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,040
i've learned how to leave what really

1046
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,280
leading from the front is

1047
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,760
and i've also had to learn

1048
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,119
that you have to

1049
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,400
be strong

1050
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,160
in times of crisis

1051
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,440
but you also have to be a real person

1052
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,240
you really have to

1053
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,359
apply those traits because

1054
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:25,440
you want your team to stay with you and

1055
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,480
you retaining talent is incredibly hard

1056
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,599
right now

1057
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,599
there's a lot of opportunities we talked

1058
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,920
about the great resignation where

1059
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,240
there's an awakening going on with our

1060
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,960
younger folks who have a different find

1061
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,560
out that they have a different calling

1062
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,400
than the one they might be working with

1063
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,960
you for

1064
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:46,960
workers

1065
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,040
and employees and team members really

1066
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,520
still want to stay with organizations

1067
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,119
that connect with them beyond the

1068
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,440
technical skills and i really do believe

1069
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,560
that

1070
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,960
there's a lot there about leveraging

1071
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,160
your personal strengths and weaknesses i

1072
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,599
always say

1073
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,920
that a team

1074
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,680
well you look at a baseball team not

1075
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,680
everyone's the first baseman not

1076
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,680
everyone's the pitcher not everyone's

1077
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,839
the catcher if you had a team full of

1078
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,040
catchers

1079
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,880
well there'd be no pictures

1080
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,160
if you didn't have somebody in the

1081
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,800
outfield catching those fly balls

1082
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,040
you'd have a lot of home runs

1083
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,560
and your first baseman would be pretty

1084
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,839
much kind of sacked

1085
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,920
so you have to look at how you build out

1086
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,079
your teams and make the investment in

1087
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,200
the teams

1088
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,599
and look at how to complement their

1089
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,599
strengths and weaknesses

1090
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,520
we've already had a lot of complexity to

1091
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,760
things out there right now

1092
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,079
but let's sort of talk about some fun

1093
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,480
ways or great ways of staying connected

1094
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,079
with your team

1095
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:50,160
overall

1096
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,720
not necessarily having a friday meetings

1097
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,800
on a friday afternoon or something maybe

1098
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,560
random during the week on wednesday

1099
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,440
afternoon so that they can actually get

1100
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,610
some other things done

1101
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,640
[Music]

1102
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,880
be respectful of the fact that you're

1103
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,960
you might be working from home but your

1104
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,480
child might be coming home from school

1105
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,640
needed to meet him at the bus stop

1106
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,160
so maybe that happens at three o'clock

1107
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,839
just don't have a meeting start at three

1108
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,920
o'clock to simply ask

1109
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,599
would it work for you to be a common

1110
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,720
even for us to meet at 3 30 instead

1111
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,400
to having an understanding of a little

1112
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,720
bit of the work-life challenges that

1113
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,599
might exist right now

1114
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,119
there was one friend of mine a good

1115
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,400
friend of mine

1116
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,920
that's a chief information security

1117
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,400
officer the beginning of all this was

1118
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,839
very adamant that they had to wear

1119
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,520
they come from the banking world they

1120
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,240
had to be all dressed up

1121
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,839
to be on zoom

1122
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,400
and if they weren't on dressed up zoom

1123
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,440
on camera they weren't working

1124
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,440
and that kind of takes a mindset from

1125
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,520
being at a big financial institution

1126
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,480
into your own home but the reality is

1127
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,200
your life kind of went upside down

1128
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,520
it's quite possible you could fit in a

1129
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,359
run or go to yoga class or how to your

1130
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,920
child is needing a snack or help with

1131
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,000
their homework

1132
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,319
and they can't be on camera

1133
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,480
it takes a long time to get ready to

1134
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,400
look like this

1135
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,319
it does

1136
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,319
but at the end of the day be thoughtful

1137
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:27,280
maybe you pre-pre

1138
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,200
determine

1139
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,920
whether that meeting really has to be on

1140
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,640
camera can it be accomplished by an

1141
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,960
old-fashioned conference call

1142
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,640
and maybe you might actually get more

1143
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,440
done

1144
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,599
because you can get

1145
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,200
a workout in

1146
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,560
and sort of

1147
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,160
feed your child

1148
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,280
and still

1149
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,400
be mr mom or mrs mom

1150
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,760
and sort of

1151
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,440
be the wonder and

1152
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,480
the

1153
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,599
getting everything done

1154
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,440
we're in an industry that puts people in

1155
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,800
the spotlight when something goes wrong

1156
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,200
it's up to us as leaders really to flip

1157
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,599
that perspective on its head

1158
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,680
studies show that 70 percent of people

1159
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,760
are more motivated by recognition than

1160
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,160
money so let's make sure we've talked to

1161
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,800
them about that praise the work and

1162
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,119
really listen to them take the time

1163
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,000
about and listen to their ideas and that

1164
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,839
does pay dividends and engagement and

1165
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,119
loyalty

1166
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,359
let's think about being positive and

1167
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,079
constructive versus destructive

1168
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,720
as the saying goes people lead managers

1169
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,240
not companies

1170
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,520
that usually goes around with the

1171
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,160
emotional not financial aspects

1172
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,079
changing our mindsets is about being

1173
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,560
more empathetic and flexibility will

1174
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,119
help us improve our retention the

1175
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,520
fasting the face of a great reservation

1176
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,920
situation in the hybrid workforce

1177
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,720
also look at changing how your team and

1178
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,319
transforming them

1179
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,640
it's really easy for our security team

1180
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,800
to become encumbered with a lot of

1181
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,720
negativity or even being dreading um the

1182
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,800
work that they're over doing because

1183
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,880
they're overwhelmed with lots of

1184
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,480
different things going on

1185
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,319
and they're not able to touch it the

1186
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:13,520
same way that they might have been

1187
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,599
before

1188
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,760
we all have to keep in mind

1189
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,280
cyber security

1190
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,240
is a business enabler we've come a long

1191
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,000
way over two almost three decades now so

1192
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,839
treat it like one to me it's a

1193
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,000
competitive advantage when something

1194
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,119
goes well

1195
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,040
reward that success

1196
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,960
and go one step further

1197
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,560
until you're bored if that works for you

1198
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,560
about those achievements

1199
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,400
when something goes wrong

1200
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,319
well if you kind of live in a world

1201
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:46,000
that's always kind of saying chicken

1202
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,599
little's going to fall the ceiling's

1203
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:48,640
falling

1204
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,400
but create a constructive learning

1205
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,400
experience for all involved

1206
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,800
practice those tabletop exercises so

1207
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,119
when the horrible day might happen

1208
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:58,880
you're ready for it and you're ready to

1209
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,720
take charge

1210
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,560
and use that time when the pressure is

1211
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,920
not necessarily on to say hey

1212
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,200
what should i've done better and

1213
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,480
differently

1214
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,839
and use that

1215
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:11,200
to use

1216
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,839
cyber security as a business enabler use

1217
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:16,000
that as an opportunity to maximize your

1218
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,480
strengths and correct the issues

1219
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,880
digital transformation is not slowing

1220
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,119
down in fact our current cloud trends

1221
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,319
and workforce is demanding it right now

1222
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:28,640
but barriers to digital transformation

1223
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,440
can be simply technological the greatest

1224
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,440
challenges for us to overcome will be

1225
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,599
the human aspects of change

1226
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:37,520
and emotional intelligent leaders that

1227
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,520
practice emotional intelligence will

1228
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,079
absolutely overcome it

1229
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,119
so

1230
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,599
here's some things about the cynics out

1231
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,680
there

1232
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,599
there's always those people that don't

1233
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,119
want to get on board don't want to

1234
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:52,560
change their ways

1235
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,920
but they'll try to influence their

1236
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,200
colleagues

1237
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,160
by calling out the huge flaws again

1238
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,560
look at that glass half full

1239
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,839
and work towards a shared goal for us at

1240
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:04,720
10

1241
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,560
that shared goal

1242
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,760
was turning our in-person events

1243
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,560
to additional set of events a platform

1244
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,520
of them

1245
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,880
to to as best as possible to emulate the

1246
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,359
experience of the in-person experience

1247
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:21,520
so that we can stay connected we can

1248
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,880
collaborate and celebrate

1249
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,839
all these types of things can only

1250
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:28,960
foster

1251
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,720
a positive change

1252
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,440
remember your greatest risk isn't the

1253
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,520
external threats that we see as the

1254
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,599
cyber security professionals

1255
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,000
it's not the insider threats

1256
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,920
it's really the dispassionate teams that

1257
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,560
don't operate at maximum potential so we

1258
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,359
need to put those soft skills to use

1259
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:51,599
create those connections

1260
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,240
identify those strengths and weaknesses

1261
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,640
and build the teams into a path a

1262
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,000
positive

1263
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,680
working unit

1264
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,960
making it that

1265
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,800
world series champion baseball team

1266
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,640
uniting such spirit

1267
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,480
dispersed teams

1268
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,560
behind a common vision

1269
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,680
requires leadership

1270
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,480
leaders that have interpersonal skills

1271
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,720
to engage with people despite the

1272
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,079
barriers

1273
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,480
but by rational

1274
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,720
and emotion

1275
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,000
this is especially true for the creative

1276
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,880
types the technology types and those

1277
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,560
that want to harness the emotional

1278
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,880
energies of their team essential to the

1279
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,400
creative process

1280
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,319
thank you very much does anyone have any

1281
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,000
questions

1282
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,639
[Applause]

1283
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,560
i mean you don't sit down and interview

1284
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,240
them because that would be very

1285
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,480
unnerving i think for somebody

1286
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,319
but i think the natural process of

1287
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,340
getting to know them and becoming

1288
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:01,760
[Music]

1289
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,040
becoming a strong acquaintance for them

1290
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,359
yeah plot of your commonality

1291
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:10,079
so one of the things i always realize is

1292
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:10,960
my

1293
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,359
my employees are not my friends right

1294
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,200
you have to keep that distance

1295
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,960
but i care about them like i would my

1296
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,839
family because they are everything

1297
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,160
but you also have to realize when you

1298
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,440
are

1299
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,680
overstepping a boundary

1300
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,359
and if they want to share something with

1301
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:28,400
you

1302
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,200
listen take the time to listen stop what

1303
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,359
you're doing and listen they want to

1304
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,040
share something extremely personal with

1305
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,640
you

1306
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,240
make sure you're doing nothing else but

1307
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,079
listening to them

1308
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,319
and then when they ask for your thoughts

1309
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:44,880
about the situation

1310
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,640
then you offer that

1311
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,520
but not like there'd be no way

1312
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,119
that i would ever call

1313
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,280
any of my employees and say

1314
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,559
and i know they might be having let's

1315
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:56,960
say a marital problem or a personal

1316
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,280
health problem i would never call be

1317
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,480
obtrusive

1318
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,960
to those situations if they wanted to

1319
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,480
talk to me about it or something you

1320
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,040
know because it was inhibiting them from

1321
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,760
work or they needed some time off

1322
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,480
that's i'll let them talk to that

1323
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:13,839
but

1324
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:16,160
that's not being proactive as being

1325
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,680
listening and being

1326
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,400
that that sounding board for them

1327
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,319
but not picking up the phone and telling

1328
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,880
them you need to go do this

1329
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,119
that's why personally i feel

1330
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,000
like the mandates with the vaccinations

1331
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,440
are extremely

1332
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,839
unconscious full and very intrusive

1333
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,920
because i don't want to know the medical

1334
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,760
history of each and every one of my

1335
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,040
employees but i provide 100 healthcare

1336
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,119
so that they can have access to good

1337
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:44,559
health care

1338
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:46,960
and that's between them and their doctor

1339
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,800
so

1340
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,319
that's how i apply emotional

1341
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:51,760
intelligence hopefully that answered

1342
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,319
your question

1343
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,720
okay

1344
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,079
exactly so

1345
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:15,920
that i i think i understand what you're

1346
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,040
saying so

1347
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,000
you have to be careful that you're not

1348
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,680
if it's a

1349
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,359
interpersonal relationship where you're

1350
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:24,720
crossing the boundary where you're

1351
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,880
feeling like it might be

1352
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,559
sexual or

1353
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:31,119
uh too friendly or something like that

1354
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:34,800
is that what you're sort of asking for

1355
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,078
okay

1356
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,119
i tend to

1357
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,280
take a step back when that happens and i

1358
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,760
sort of just listen and

1359
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,319
process and sort of say okay you know i

1360
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:49,839
just i don't know how

1361
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:52,559
i try to react as best as possible

1362
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:56,000
because it's happened certainly for sure

1363
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,160
but you know you try to position it in a

1364
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,079
way is are they just trying to be your

1365
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:01,760
friend to tell you something very

1366
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,480
confidential or are they actually asking

1367
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,839
you something

1368
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:08,000
that they might need some assistance

1369
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,359
with

1370
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:11,040
and that's where you sort of have to

1371
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,359
sort of work with them to gauge that in

1372
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:16,079
the conversation

1373
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:17,839
and then

1374
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:20,480
apply it appropriately

1375
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,359
does that yeah

1376
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,119
yes

1377
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,200
i don't have a question marcy but if i

1378
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,040
had not have just heard you say

1379
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,200
cocktails and conversations was the

1380
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,800
first time you've done it i would not

1381
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,480
have believed it you guys did a great

1382
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,400
job with that and that actually helped

1383
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,559
me throughout the pandemic because that

1384
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,720
gave me the ability to meet with my

1385
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,800
peers so thank you well thank you very

1386
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,119
much for saying that i was frightened to

1387
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,440
death when i turned on that

1388
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,559
camera

1389
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:51,440
that was sitting in front of my desk

1390
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,599
i've never been there before

1391
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,359
and um i have to tell you my husband um

1392
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:58,079
we

1393
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:00,480
moved everything around in my office put

1394
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,720
on this huge flat screen

1395
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,599
like smart tv that takes up the entire

1396
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,559
wall

1397
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:07,760
gonna be

1398
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,440
zoom camera which is so hard to get at

1399
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,280
first and a ring light

1400
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,119
and basically you walk in the office and

1401
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:14,559
it looks like a

1402
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,720
studio for like a new show or something

1403
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:17,920
because there's a vest there and

1404
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,839
everything like that and arrange the

1405
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:21,440
bookcase and

1406
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,520
um it's a little moyeristic if you

1407
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,280
really think about your you know if you

1408
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,800
don't have a background up but there's

1409
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,480
now the glory background which is kind

1410
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,920
of nice if your bookcase is a little

1411
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,200
messy

1412
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,520
my desk has gotten very messy so i

1413
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,760
sometimes put the blurry background on

1414
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,800
does anyone else have a question

1415
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,800
sure

1416
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,480
um i think hr people are

1417
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,079
you know the soft skills of the

1418
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:01,680
emotional intelligence so they're the

1419
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,000
ones they're readily supposedly supposed

1420
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,839
to be practicing this

1421
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:09,359
um not all of them are able to do it i

1422
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,200
think overall there's a tremendous

1423
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,559
disconnect which is a whole nother

1424
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,480
conversation between hr and most

1425
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,680
departments

1426
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,960
i think

1427
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,200
especially with technology especially

1428
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,760
especially so with cyber security

1429
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,119
one of the things i've seen over the

1430
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:24,880
years is they really don't understand

1431
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,240
how to hire a cyber security

1432
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:28,160
professional they want to go off a

1433
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,760
checklist and totally don't know what

1434
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,440
they're reading and understanding what

1435
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,000
to prioritize and they get really hung

1436
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,480
up on the education component uh overall

1437
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,559
and that really frustrates me being

1438
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,160
involved

1439
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,920
supposed to get on stage

1440
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,760
frustrates me because i've been involved

1441
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,160
with a lot of technology

1442
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,119
work uh career type of programs that

1443
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,280
jumpstart like a boot camp

1444
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,240
that takes a high school grad that may

1445
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,160
have worked for a few years but did not

1446
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,079
was not able to go to college

1447
00:52:58,079 --> 00:52:59,359
and teach them

1448
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:00,640
some great

1449
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,280
like marketable skills like servicenow

1450
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,000
and

1451
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,720
salesforce.com and front-end development

1452
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,960
things like that and then in

1453
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,550
12 weeks they're being hired by

1454
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:12,880
[Music]

1455
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,520
top companies because there's a short a

1456
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,319
shortage of work you know the workforce

1457
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:20,800
that are high demand skills

1458
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:21,599
and

1459
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:23,680
i think a lot of hr folks

1460
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,280
don't understand how that really works

1461
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,040
with technology

1462
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,720
so that's a whole another topic for

1463
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,720
