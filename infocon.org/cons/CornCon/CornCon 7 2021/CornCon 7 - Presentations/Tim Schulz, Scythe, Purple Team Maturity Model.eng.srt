excited to have everyone here and happy

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,280
to be back out in the real world again

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,800
instead of doing a virtual call line

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,080
last year

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,160
uh thank you again so much for attending

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,759
we really really appreciate the team

10
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,199
here

11
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,039
they'll be your track to dj for most of

12
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,560
that and uh first up we have tim schultz

13
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,039
uh from site he's going to give a great

14
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,240
talk on

15
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,000
purple team attorney model

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,199
again

17
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,840
thank you very much

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,719
thank you so much for that introduction

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,120
so this is the first talk i've given in

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,879
person in two years

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,680
so uh that's what funny enough the last

22
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,760
time i gave a talk in person was at the

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,600
sands purple team summit where i met my

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,680
now boss was not at the time george

25
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,879
ortiz

26
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,920
so it was kind of fun to uh mark that

27
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,399
two-year with another purple team talk

28
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,800
this one a little bit more progress

29
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,640
so this is my first time in the quad

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,880
cities i've had a lot of fun it's uh

31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,439
it's been a great time we talked i got

32
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,960
to meet a bunch of the other speakers

33
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,720
and attendees last night

34
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,320
through a series of

35
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,240
moving between restaurants and different

36
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,000
rooms depending on what clothes at a

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,640
time so that was uh reminds me of

38
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,880
growing up in mississippi

39
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,600
so who am i first of all my name is tim

40
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,920
schultz i am the adversary emulation

41
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,600
lead here at uh site so prior to site

42
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,079
i've been here since about february now

43
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,200
and

44
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,759
i was at uh before i was at mitre who

45
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,200
most of you have probably heard of

46
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,960
especially with attack who worked on the

47
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,079
attack evals team with the attack team

48
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,040
and then

49
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,280
also one that you may not have heard of

50
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,159
is sandia national ladders and so

51
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,000
between the two of those spent about six

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,240
years doing habitat emulation although

53
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,600
it wasn't quite called that purple

54
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,520
teaming and so it's sort of uh

55
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,520
culminated into everything that i'm

56
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,759
going to go over today

57
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,600
so a quick road map of what we're going

58
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,759
to do here we're going to talk about why

59
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,680
does purple need a maturity model and so

60
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,038
if you're not familiar with purple tv

61
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,479
don't worry i'm going to go over what

62
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,800
purple teaming is what it looks like and

63
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,560
run you through sort of a quick purple

64
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,200
team exercise so you'll get an idea of

65
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,120
what i'm talking about and then from

66
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,360
there we're going to go into what is the

67
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,000
purple team maturity model and then how

68
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,520
to actually apply it and that's

69
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,440
something that's always fun with models

70
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,000
as well this is good in the lab but how

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,640
do we apply this in the real world

72
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,239
so the first step we're going to dive

73
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,000
into is why does purple need a maturity

74
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,160
model and what does purple team do so

75
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,080
the infosec teams of today that walk

76
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,080
through a little bit of history is that

77
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,280
everyone's

78
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,040
started with either a blue team or red

79
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,200
team most companies have blue teams

80
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,680
these days or whether it's outsourced or

81
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,280
they have a

82
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,080
service provider or they have their own

83
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,440
internal team

84
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,440
red teams are something that have

85
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,760
existed for a long time sort of military

86
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,120
background as far as the term but we see

87
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,959
more and more companies today are trying

88
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,720
to integrate red team and really what it

89
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,959
comes down to is security testing

90
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:09,920
into

91
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,800
their uh into their day-to-day workflow

92
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,680
and now a newer player to the game is

93
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,519
cyber threat intelligence so this is

94
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,440
something that the question always comes

95
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,760
why purple teaming why now and part of

96
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,920
that is the explosion of cyber threat

97
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,640
intelligence we remember back when the

98
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,519
apt-1 report came out it was it was a

99
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,840
huge set shockwave throughout the entire

100
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,599
community internationally as well

101
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,920
because it gave attribution it talked

102
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,599
about all these activities that people

103
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,120
knew about behind the scenes but no one

104
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,280
was willing to talk about and so from

105
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,360
there we had more and more private

106
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,680
companies private and industry

107
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,840
have released reports we had the release

108
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,799
of attack that sort of put those all in

109
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,560
a library that everyone could go look

110
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,959
through and analyze i'll talk more about

111
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,879
attack later but that's sort of where

112
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,799
the explosion of adding contents to the

113
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,040
previous red and blue team attacks uh

114
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,640
and so that's where blue teams before

115
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,319
were just having to fend off whatever

116
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,840
was at their firewall they didn't

117
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,480
necessarily have strategic plan because

118
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,879
they didn't have the data necessary and

119
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,680
same with red teams it was and still is

120
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,839
at times up to the creativity of the red

121
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,000
team which sometimes can supersede what

122
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,519
adversaries are doing that becomes

123
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,199
problematic when you are trying to

124
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,360
actually give metrics to your leadership

125
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,880
teams and drive change in organizations

126
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,360
so as far as what purple tv is it's the

127
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,759
culmination of all those together and so

128
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,360
your first purple team experience would

129
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,520
be essentially bringing those three

130
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,919
teams together now i say teams if you're

131
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,240
a small company this might be just you

132
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,639
this might be you with three hats on or

133
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,320
people that only have

134
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,440
one or two infosec professionals they're

135
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,800
going to be able to do this by

136
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,600
themselves as well and so

137
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,600
what we do at scythe is we have the

138
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,919
purple team uh exercise framework that's

139
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,400
sort of our our introduction to purple

140
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,560
teaming for people that don't that have

141
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,120
never done this before and so this is

142
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,720
where you're going to walk through a six

143
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,479
step process and i've got a nicer on the

144
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,240
next slide here that's got a couple of

145
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,400
different predefined holes that's part

146
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,479
of this purple team exercise framework

147
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,080
that is that first time you're walking

148
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,280
through something

149
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,520
and so your exercise coordinator is

150
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,479
going to introduce what the test is so

151
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,280
the entire test is transparent that's

152
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,639
something that's very different from red

153
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,800
teams as well is that you have a

154
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,880
transparent task if i'm the exercise

155
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,000
coordinator i'm going to tell you

156
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,639
exactly what commands i'm going to run

157
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,240
and we're going to walk through a couple

158
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,600
different steps the first one is a

159
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,360
tabletop exercise

160
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,840
that tabletop exercise is going to be

161
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,800
the first data point it's

162
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,520
what is the expectation when this uh

163
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,000
when this command is run

164
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,039
what is going to

165
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,319
oh yes

166
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,600
yes uh so we do have table top exercises

167
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,520
and by we mean uh

168
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,880
corncon and scythe and bryson my ceo was

169
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,880
actually running i think the ics one

170
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,600
this afternoon so go sign up tabletops

171
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,400
are great because you don't have to be a

172
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,759
super league hacker in order to

173
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,080
participate and to understand

174
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,000
what's going to happen so that's

175
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,919
something that this is why tabletops are

176
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,639
important and a part of this

177
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,840
this chain of steps so that expectation

178
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,319
asking what do you expect is it the edr

179
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,240
is it going to fire do you have another

180
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,400
defensive tool or vendor that you're

181
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,039
assuming is going to pop up an alert

182
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,560
whether it's an email or something like

183
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,639
that it's your first data point

184
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,960
second uh the next step is going to be

185
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,800
actually running the tests and so then

186
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,280
you have the ability to compare what was

187
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,759
the expectation what was the actual test

188
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,160
result and you have those that you can

189
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,400
work with leadership to address whether

190
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,960
or not uh if specific tools are working

191
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,880
or not and this is something that you

192
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,680
repeat over and over and over again so i

193
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,360
do have a couple other steps in there as

194
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,520
far as the blue team process and i want

195
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,240
to highlight that separately so part of

196
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,400
purple teaming is addressing not just

197
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,240
the technologies but also the people in

198
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,400
the process when we're going through a

199
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,240
purple team exercise

200
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,560
we are at well in the past year and a

201
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,759
half we've mostly been doing it

202
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,720
virtually and so what this means is that

203
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,759
you are screen sharing and often times

204
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,759
the challenge with zoom in some of those

205
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,520
is interactivity which is really

206
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,160
important part of purple team and so

207
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,120
what i'll do is i will execute the test

208
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,199
after we've recorded the tabletop and

209
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,240
say all right who is your analyst that

210
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,639
would first pre-options and so working

211
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,720
from like a three-tier stock model we

212
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,720
would work with the level one analyst

213
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,560
and say share your screen show us the

214
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,960
dashboards that you're going to look at

215
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,879
what is this going to populate and so

216
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,520
for one exercise we they have a firewall

217
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,160
block and they said this is this url is

218
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,800
not categorized and an apple register as

219
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,560
that would be an alert and so at that

220
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,960
point i would take it i'd go do some

221
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,479
just a little bit more in depth checking

222
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,800
and make sure it's not false positive

223
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,879
pass it up and so that's where it would

224
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,759
escalate to our level two and so they

225
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,360
stop sharing their screen level two

226
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,919
person gets on and shares their screen

227
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,319
and so you can see how we can evaluate

228
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,479
the entire process and especially you

229
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,280
can identify gaps if there are gaps in

230
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,680
not just your technology coverage

231
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,479
also as people are trying to respond to

232
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,479
ransomware for instance i do a lot of

233
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,640
ransomware emulations and so time is of

234
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,279
the essence there you need everyone to

235
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,519
have a concrete process that they are

236
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,799
going to follow to the letter

237
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,919
potentially when you're in crisis mode

238
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,039
so

239
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,839
that is what purple team means in a

240
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,160
purple team exercise uh framework is

241
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,920
you're going through that over and over

242
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,440
and over again it's very deliberate

243
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,320
testing it can be slow and a little bit

244
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,839
different than your typical red team

245
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,720
test which is why it can be uh

246
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,000
some folks might not uh like it as much

247
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,279
but the value you get from it is really

248
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,800
what is important i mentioned those

249
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,320
there's a couple of those key data

250
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
points in addition to

251
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,480
being able at the end to

252
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,399
evaluate the people process and

253
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,560
technology you also have that feedback

254
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,040
loop of i can rerun the test for

255
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,519
instance i'm not trying to uh not show

256
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,360
my cards here and that's something that

257
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,480
a lot of times when you are doing

258
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,080
security testing if you're doing pen

259
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,080
testing or red teaming you may not want

260
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,360
to reveal

261
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,640
what your tests are doing however since

262
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,320
we are being fully transparent about

263
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
this if you do have uh detection

264
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,480
engineers for people that can write new

265
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,800
logic to try and detect that test you

266
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
can do it in real time and so that's

267
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,360
where the value for the business really

268
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,080
comes in and this is from uh some of the

269
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,680
purple team exercises that we've done on

270
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,399
a recurring basis we've seen enabled

271
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,760
we've been able to get people from

272
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,160
essentially zero percent detections to

273
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,920
60 in just a couple weeks

274
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,240
so the challenges as i've mentioned a

275
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,839
little bit you've probably picked up on

276
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,519
some themes here is that

277
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,600
purple teaming at this point we talk

278
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,880
about it and it can be a singular

279
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,560
exercise people do it once and are like

280
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,079
great that's awesome

281
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,200
we're done

282
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,680
and maybe they do it even quarterly but

283
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,399
the the real issue between this is that

284
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,560
teams are silent or communities are

285
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,880
silent and so we see this across red

286
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,640
teams blue teams and cyber threat

287
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,320
intelligence we all have our own

288
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,959
conferences to go to and and the

289
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,399
expertise that we're trying to build

290
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,839
within our own garment environment and

291
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,040
so the challenge is that you're not

292
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,120
necessarily going to do that

293
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,680
cross-pollination except every quarter

294
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,480
or once a year and so even though the

295
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,720
the business metrics and the value that

296
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,560
you see are are very clear and so

297
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,560
all of that comes down to communication

298
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,480
and teams

299
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,600
especially if they're separate if

300
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,880
they're in separate

301
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,360
directorates even they don't have to

302
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,680
communicate it's optional and so that's

303
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,360
where talking about

304
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,360
why we would move towards purple teaming

305
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,000
as an actual team it's because we want

306
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,240
to take all the business value and the

307
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,399
justification that we've seen and

308
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,560
keep it together forever

309
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,040
and so that's what i'm pitching here

310
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,640
with the purple team maturity model is

311
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,959
the first step is you are going to have

312
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,120
a purple team that is not going to be

313
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,040
just an exercise is going to be moving

314
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,000
past that and taking a team of people

315
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,920
and i would even say potentially in the

316
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,519
future this is going to be the majority

317
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,839
of teams because you're going to need

318
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,440
people that have

319
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,600
a mixed series of expertise to truly

320
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,399
defend against the current threats

321
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,320
so that's where talking about the shift

322
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,480
in blue teams have their own business

323
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,079
case right teams have their own business

324
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,320
case and that's where i don't want to

325
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,959
necessarily say that if you're a large

326
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,480
enough organization you're not going to

327
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,639
have the resources the people or the

328
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,720
need to do all those things

329
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,600
but

330
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,760
together when you are trying to defend

331
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,000
an organization as a whole the purple

332
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,720
team is going to be and having that very

333
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,560
deliberate testing and making sure that

334
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,519
you're

335
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,760
able to figure out where in your

336
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,760
defenses how gaps where in your process

337
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,839
you have gaps that is going to become a

338
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,720
mindset you need to have every day

339
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,200
and so that's why we need a maturity

340
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,920
model is to evaluate how do we how do we

341
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,240
move from that concept of just having a

342
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,839
team into

343
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,680
measuring it because that's what that's

344
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,839
part of what has gotten purple teaming

345
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,839
to where it is now is the ability to

346
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,279
measure results

347
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,200
and so that's why the purple team

348
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,800
maturity model as you'll see we're

349
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,600
working on building out a measurable way

350
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,000
to look at teams and evaluate how teams

351
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,240
are in that process

352
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,240
so i've gone over a little bit of this

353
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,240
this is where we're at currently is that

354
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,600
we have these three separate teams

355
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,079
they're working together sometimes or

356
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,519
when they're forced to at the end of a

357
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,200
report for instance if you're doing a

358
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,160
red team engagement and so we need to

359
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,040
move to all those three into a specific

360
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,800
purple team

361
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,320
and so the way we are moving past just

362
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,200
purple as a team into specific areas of

363
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,800
expertise because that's always

364
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,240
something we need to figure out what

365
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,519
we're measuring

366
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,000
is these two that i've i've broken down

367
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,600
into threat understanding and to

368
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,440
detection understanding

369
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,120
now if you're a red teamer or a blue

370
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,639
teamer or a little bit of both you can

371
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,959
probably see a little bit of yourself

372
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,680
or the expertise in one of these

373
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,720
now

374
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,399
if you're cyber threat intelligence you

375
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,000
might have a little bit more difficulty

376
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,160
picking one specifically now the reason

377
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,839
i chose the word understanding for these

378
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,560
is because the context as i talked about

379
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,320
that cyber threat intelligence provides

380
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,600
earlier is critical when you are trying

381
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,839
to determine what you're going to test

382
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,120
because you want to make sure that the

383
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,760
adversaries that you're targeting

384
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,240
if you are doing adversary emulation are

385
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,519
going to be adversaries that are going

386
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,920
to target your organization because if

387
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,079
you're picking just random adversaries

388
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,240
that could be good but everyone has

389
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,320
limited budget everyone has limited time

390
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,160
constraints and so we want to make sure

391
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,399
that everything that's chosen has a

392
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,440
reason

393
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,360
and so the same with detection

394
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,480
understanding

395
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,199
so we tend to write detections and maps

396
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,160
or for the latest vulnerability and

397
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,079
throw everything together i think of

398
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,320
david bianco's pyramid of adversary pain

399
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,600
here and

400
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,160
the very bottom of that is

401
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,000
indicators of compromise because they're

402
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,800
super easy for blue teams and everyone

403
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,639
to integrate because you have tools that

404
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,880
can just you can feed it in it'll scan

405
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,639
the network for those and any time it

406
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,959
pops up on an end point you'll squash it

407
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,040
but the challenge is those are super

408
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,720
easy to change from the attacker's

409
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,720
standpoint it's really easy especially

410
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,079
with all the automation that we're

411
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,160
seeing and the

412
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,480
shift in business case for ransomware

413
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,880
developing new capabilities at a

414
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,480
pretty rapid pace

415
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,399
you we have to move beyond that and so

416
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,760
that's where detection understanding is

417
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,920
so important is you need to understand

418
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,480
what detections are in your environment

419
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,959
and and what depth do they work because

420
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,480
that's something that we've seen a lot

421
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,480
of teams once you write a detection you

422
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,639
just assume it works all the time even

423
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,399
if you push out new detections if you

424
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,959
push out uh any configuration chains who

425
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,639
goes and verifies that all the old stuff

426
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,880
still works and so there are a few

427
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,720
projects in place that are looking at

428
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,480
how to do some of that i'll give a shout

429
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,720
out to splunk and their attack range

430
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,399
project because they've tackled a little

431
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,440
bit of that

432
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,360
but that's sort of the key a key

433
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,560
challenge with this is as automation and

434
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,279
our infrastructure is scaled we have not

435
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,920
necessarily scaled our testing methods

436
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,160
and so that's really a key thing with

437
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,800
the understanding behind each of these

438
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,519
is making sure that your teams are aware

439
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,120
of what's going to

440
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,959
actually take place in their environment

441
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,880
and choose to be very deliberate with

442
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,600
their time and their resources

443
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,440
so as far as detection understanding

444
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,120
goes let's dive into each of these a

445
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,399
little bit more

446
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,079
these are some of the questions that

447
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,759
your folks that are working on this

448
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,920
we're going to ask what are the log and

449
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,759
telemetry sources we have everything

450
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,680
starts with data where are we getting

451
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,920
our data what can we do with it can we

452
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,720
analyze it and then what is our process

453
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,160
i mentioned before this is going to be

454
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,040
that people process and technology

455
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,880
and so all these things are going to

456
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,360
inform your threat understanding

457
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,880
what are the adversaries that are

458
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,279
targeting our organization or

459
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,519
are vertical and so trying to understand

460
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,040
that bringing it all together is going

461
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,480
to be key

462
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,360
to

463
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,680
having that back and forth between your

464
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,759
threat understanding and your detection

465
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,199
understanding because

466
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,279
it all starts with data and if you have

467
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,800
good data you have a good understanding

468
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,480
of who's targeting your industry you can

469
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,399
go collect samples you can go do

470
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,320
analysis but if you don't have any of

471
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,199
that you're not going to be able to

472
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,240
even start through this process

473
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,160
so as far as actually building out the

474
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,519
model i mentioned we have these two

475
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,839
different things now we have three

476
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,839
different levels and so the first one

477
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,800
that i outline is deployment so this is

478
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,720
where everyone starts this is where you

479
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,720
get that fancy new shiny tool regardless

480
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,640
of what it is and you put it in your

481
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,280
environment and it's great you use it

482
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,839
it's fantastic it gives you either

483
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,319
visibility or or puts a couple of things

484
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,599
uh into a single dashboard for instance

485
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,319
but the challenge with that is uh and if

486
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,000
you've ever seen an analyst screen that

487
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,319
has splunk you have like 40 tabs open

488
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,039
and at all times and so it's well we

489
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,960
have 10 different dashboards and we have

490
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,720
these different things and and that's

491
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,240
that's just life

492
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,320
which is fine but that's where we need

493
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,400
to shift up to level two integration

494
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,080
this is where you're taking multiple

495
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,320
tools multiple processes and putting

496
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,240
them together in order to achieve

497
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,880
something that alone they could not and

498
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,320
so that's what's so important about

499
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,960
integration is you have to be able to

500
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,880
take all these tools as everything's

501
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,200
scaled you got to put them together

502
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,240
and then the last level is creation

503
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,240
this is the ability to create your own

504
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,559
novel detections your own novel tests

505
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,320
based on your own internal knowledge

506
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,640
and integrate them into your pipeline

507
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,720
and so this is the peak level because it

508
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,640
does require the most expertise it

509
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,320
requires the most familiarity with the

510
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,120
tool

511
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,919
but at this level you're able to adapt

512
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,760
with adversaries as they're coming out

513
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,600
with new techniques

514
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,559
and so i do have two examples that we're

515
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,840
going to walk through for these

516
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,520
specific for these specific detection

517
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,679
and threat understanding so hopefully

518
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,600
you're familiar at least with one of

519
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,720
these

520
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,480
so the first one i'm going to go over is

521
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,720
sigma so this is essentially

522
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,360
more standardized logging across vendors

523
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,600
that was something that florian roth is

524
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,520
the original creator of this project

525
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,440
from a couple years ago

526
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,679
and he releases a lot of free detection

527
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,360
so i highly recommend people check this

528
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,960
out if you haven't

529
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,320
and so

530
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,559
the first step would be

531
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,120
just deploying your sigma rules into the

532
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,320
sim again this is where you put it in

533
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,280
and

534
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,360
hopefully it works

535
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,320
the

536
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,320
after that though

537
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,480
after seeing whether or not you have any

538
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,080
detections that come as a result

539
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,400
triaging it hopefully tuning some

540
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,919
because that's something that's also

541
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,160
very challenging is that everyone's

542
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,320
environment is a little bit different

543
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,280
and so

544
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,160
after you've gotten all that initial

545
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,160
deployment done this is where you want

546
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,679
to start integrating with your other

547
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,000
tools if you have a sandboxing process

548
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,960
can you run these rules earlier in uh

549
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,600
before something hits your users this is

550
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,880
uh where you're gonna have to get

551
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,120
creative with your current technology

552
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,039
stack because you may have tools that

553
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,840
i'm not even mentioning up here and they

554
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,799
could be part of your pipeline and so

555
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,400
putting all these things together to

556
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,600
minimize the amount of people time that

557
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,600
need to go in and actually perform the

558
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,000
analysis the triage things like that

559
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,160
that's really going to allow your

560
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,120
organization to scale that much better

561
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,520
and then the last one is deploying

562
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,679
developing new sigma rules of course

563
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,440
this is going to be specific to your

564
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,320
organization potentially maybe you are

565
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,840
able to lock things down in a way that

566
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,159
no one else can and that's where you can

567
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,640
essentially have sigma rules that are

568
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,960
a bit over sensitive to

569
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,480
environments and and that's great

570
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,880
but that's where you need to be able to

571
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,799
make those adjustments and you need to

572
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,039
be able to figure out how do we develop

573
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,000
this how do we tune this to our needs so

574
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,039
that

575
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,280
it's not a tool that's going to actually

576
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,200
take more time to use

577
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,159
than it's providing value

578
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,400
so with that we'll shift over to atomic

579
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,120
red team for threat understanding

580
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,120
so atomic print team for those of you

581
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,640
that aren't familiar quick introduction

582
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,159
about it it is red canaries open source

583
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,440
testing suite and so it links to miter

584
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,440
attack which is great and basically

585
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,159
allows you to do singular tasks of a

586
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,960
specific technique at a time and so they

587
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,440
have it's got a pretty good

588
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,840
community contribution effort going to

589
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,080
it so we've contributed a few ourselves

590
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,240
and just want to highlight it's it's a

591
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,760
really cool project

592
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,960
and so after you've used it and run it a

593
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,039
few times it's a great way to do that

594
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,320
initial

595
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,799
running a single test to detect a single

596
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,640
detection and this is i mentioned before

597
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,640
splunk's attack range we use tonic red

598
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,520
team

599
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,840
to validate their

600
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,120
testing and so after you've deployed

601
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,039
that you've run a couple of tests you've

602
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,679
validated that things work this is where

603
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:36,640
again

604
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,679
putting it into your development uh

605
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,760
pipeline is going to be really important

606
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,159
because if you write a new test the new

607
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,840
detection you want to make sure it fires

608
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,919
almost immediately see if that logic

609
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,520
works because this if if not then it's

610
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,360
going to sit out there you'll have false

611
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,000
confidence or if it oh it runs too much

612
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,600
then you're going to flood your sock

613
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,679
with a bunch of additional tickets that

614
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,280
they don't want to deal with

615
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,120
so this is where it's really important

616
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,280
to tune those things as early in your

617
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,919
testing process as possible

618
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,840
and then the last step

619
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,480
is developing of course new atomic red

620
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,320
team techniques so this is something

621
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,799
that even if you feel that you don't

622
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,360
have maybe the expertise to do some of

623
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,039
this stuff and tell you you probably

624
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,760
have pretty unique data everyone is

625
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,919
getting hit with similar strains of

626
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,400
ransomware things like that but things

627
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,200
do shift slightly depending on

628
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,039
depending on where where your

629
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,600
organization sits in the landscape and

630
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,799
so

631
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,679
just diving into that a little bit

632
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,919
if you are able to collect new logs at

633
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,960
your firewall for instance and see if if

634
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,960
you're if you have a honeypot or

635
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,960
something like that sitting out you can

636
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,200
collect data on who's trying to attack

637
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,120
you even if it's mass attackers just

638
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,120
trying to scan the entire internet and

639
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,039
so that's kind of stuff can help inform

640
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,679
you because or you might want to figure

641
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,520
out who is that that's scanning because

642
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,880
say they did get it what are they going

643
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,799
to do next that's always the questions

644
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,760
that should help inform your testing and

645
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,360
maybe those next steps have been

646
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,280
profiled in

647
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,159
some

648
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,559
cti report that's been released but you

649
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,320
don't actually have in your testing

650
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,400
there you go you've identified a gap and

651
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,480
so that's that's where you can really

652
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,400
take the data that you have to build

653
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,720
these new techniques because oftentimes

654
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,520
uh it tends to be folks that are newer

655
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,400
to

656
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,720
influence how can i give back or how can

657
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,320
i contribute we have all these experts

658
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,000
doing things all the time

659
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,240
and that's why i say there's always

660
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,640
variations on things and so whether it's

661
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,039
a different flag those types of things

662
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,360
uh you'd be amazed red canary also

663
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,559
releases a threat detection like overall

664
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,559
report that i also encourage you to look

665
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,400
through but they showcase different

666
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,360
flags that adversaries use when they are

667
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,520
running powershell commands and they

668
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,080
shorthand things different ways so if

669
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,200
your detection for instance has

670
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,440
for powershell looks at for encoded

671
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,480
commands looks for a fully spelled out

672
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,000
encoded command

673
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,120
and somebody uses dash ec

674
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,600
instead is your detection some way to

675
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,480
catch that those are the types of things

676
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,520
that are going to allow you to further

677
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,960
build up

678
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,240
new tests for your environment

679
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,559
so all this comes down to communication

680
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,080
the teams need to work together you have

681
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,919
your threat understanding you have your

682
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,440
attention

683
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,440
but everybody still needs to be working

684
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,159
together because that is the point of an

685
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,919
accuracy perfect team and a formal

686
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,000
purple team is going to be bringing all

687
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,440
this together

688
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,640
so

689
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,799
i've got a little bit nicer one here and

690
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,720
so this is what it looks like so it's a

691
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,440
quad chart essentially uh with our

692
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,159
well nine block and this is essentially

693
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,559
allows us to chart our path through it

694
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,159
and that's going to be really important

695
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,320
when you are trying to develop a road

696
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,480
map because that is part of also what

697
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,960
we're talking about here is how we move

698
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,360
a team that has been focused into

699
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,520
deployment now they have a path forward

700
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,200
so what do we do about that how do we

701
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,720
get them to integration how do we get

702
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,120
them to creation and so besides just me

703
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,159
giving you philosophicals here um

704
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,480
i'm also going to walk you through how

705
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,400
we would use it and so i'd like to

706
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,640
introduce you to unicorn inc

707
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,039
we have alex is from the blue team

708
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,360
representing the sock we have brooke who

709
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,200
is representing the red team and then

710
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,440
casey is our cyber threat intelligence

711
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,000
professional and so they are going to be

712
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,559
going on a journey of becoming a purple

713
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,760
team

714
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,799
so their current roles at unicorn theme

715
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,360
is alex as i mentioned in the sock

716
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,960
builds new detections based on the

717
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,640
latest indicators of compromise the

718
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,039
casey senzo now this is good and this is

719
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,799
very common that we see that the cyber

720
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,880
threat intelligence folks and the

721
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,039
sock folks tend to work together

722
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,880
sometimes they're even co-located and

723
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,440
the cti folks are sitting in the side

724
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,240
so this is this is a really good start

725
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,240
to our communications

726
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,960
and we have brooke who is

727
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,720
surfs twitter uses the latest and

728
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,400
greatest bypasses and red team tools and

729
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,640
is able to get in every single time

730
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,600
and then

731
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,080
we have casey who reads every single

732
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,840
cyber threat intelligence report that

733
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,960
comes out

734
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,200
now the challenge with some of this is

735
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,960
everyone's doing their job

736
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,320
and so

737
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,960
the how do you how do you shift that

738
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,799
focus into

739
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,559
a singular

740
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,679
one team

741
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,320
and like sometimes you'll management

742
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,320
will do that for you you are now a team

743
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,480
congratulations your purple team

744
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,000
get along

745
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,120
and so

746
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,919
they don't know where are we

747
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,760
and so trying to chart this out and

748
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,720
figure out how do we shift the roles

749
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,200
into a common

750
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,520
language or common goal that everyone

751
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,840
can work together at is really what it

752
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,400
comes down to and so i've outlined here

753
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,760
alex who remember was our blue teamer

754
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,840
sock person that pulled into the purple

755
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,720
team

756
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,120
now runs new detections by brook our

757
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,640
former red teamer

758
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,799
to ensure that they work and to see if

759
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,200
they're easily bypassed this is where

760
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,279
you have that communication is key

761
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,120
because if it's something that gets

762
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,360
bypassed just instantly the question

763
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,760
becomes should we even deploy this maybe

764
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,039
i should go back and work on it some

765
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:27,919
more

766
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,559
also incorporates new uh detections for

767
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,600
for new malware that casey is looking up

768
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,760
and so that's going to be

769
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,919
again tying the cyber threat

770
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,000
intelligence reports already done some

771
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,840
of this so this is really just keeping

772
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,320
it a step up because it's identifying

773
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,080
the techniques so we moved up from

774
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,799
indicators of compromise up to behaviors

775
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,360
and then also researching integration

776
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,720
points because they're currently at

777
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,200
deployment how do we move beyond that

778
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,039
what are things that i use that i can

779
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,960
integrate with others in order to make

780
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,440
all of our lives easier

781
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,919
so brooke our former red teamer

782
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,039
now builds tests to validate detections

783
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,000
so this is going to be uh this is key in

784
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,279
that it's using your creative mindset to

785
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,520
make sure everything currently works

786
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,159
and then also making sure that they're

787
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,320
incorporating techniques from the cyber

788
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,320
threat intelligence professional that is

789
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,480
real malware that's real data that you

790
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,080
can tie to that's something that's

791
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,760
always i've had

792
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,600
challenges getting red teamers to do is

793
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,679
because you're scoping them

794
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,080
you're you're forcing them into a box so

795
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,399
to speak and that that's something uh

796
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,320
that can be a challenge because most of

797
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,720
the time red teams uh and especially if

798
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,120
they've been on a lot of uh a lot of

799
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,880
different engagements they essentially

800
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,840
have

801
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,679
they have no restraints and it's great

802
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,520
it's fun if you're on that team because

803
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,640
you get to use your creativity uh to the

804
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,880
max but that's where

805
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,279
focusing and channeling it into figuring

806
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,360
out how would an adversary adapt from

807
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,000
this how would they use how that team

808
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,840
take what they currently have and build

809
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,919
more capability is going to be how your

810
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:07,679
red team will really bring a ton of

811
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,200
value to this role they can still be

812
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,799
creative it's just going to be a little

813
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,159
bit more focused and then any time so

814
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,080
brooke is still on twitter and anytime

815
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,399
they find new techniques from uh from

816
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,080
twitter that they think are interesting

817
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,760
pass it on to alex who's the detection

818
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,240
engineer to figure out how to create new

819
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,600
detections for

820
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,200
so again

821
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,679
still doing very similar roles that they

822
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,279
did before

823
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,240
but they are now doing it as a team

824
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,480
and so casey is going to research

825
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,799
attackers that are targeting the unicorn

826
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,360
industry so remember before

827
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,520
casey was looking at every single vendor

828
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,240
report which a couple years ago might

829
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,559
not have been too bad but these days you

830
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,559
have enough reports coming out it's easy

831
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,559
to get overwhelmed and this becomes a

832
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,080
point where you also need to scope your

833
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,399
cyber threat intelligence to focus on

834
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,640
your industry first doesn't mean that

835
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,640
those other ones are not valuable but as

836
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,720
far as actual focusing

837
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,120
to a specific industry or specific

838
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,440
organization if you're large enough then

839
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,000
you should do that and so then as as

840
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,360
we've already covered essentially is

841
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,240
providing reports and techniques to

842
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,200
alex and brooke based on what specific

843
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,240
technologies malware is using as well as

844
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,840
new techniques and zero days that we

845
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,120
discovered

846
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,760
and so that's overall how we've shifted

847
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,320
all the roles it's not a massive shift

848
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,399
necessarily but it is a mindset shift

849
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,240
because it requires communicating with

850
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,559
colleagues more than before it requires

851
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,360
really being deliberate in deciding that

852
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,440
your cyber threat intelligence person is

853
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,080
going to have to go out and look for

854
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,000
specific unicorn uh malware or unicorn

855
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,399
threat actors

856
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,720
and so with the joint goals it does

857
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,520
allow you to chart where your way

858
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,399
through

859
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,480
uh through the purple maturity model and

860
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,840
so the other thing i want to highlight

861
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,000
here is that most teams that i've

862
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,840
encountered have actually started

863
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,200
they're really high on the detection

864
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,360
engineering side of things

865
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,519
and the threat understanding is where

866
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,600
they are struggling or trying to figure

867
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,519
out how do we do security testing and

868
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,960
how do we do

869
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,840
do

870
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,000
do testing against ransomware use

871
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,519
ransomware has been the driver for

872
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,840
almost everything now and so

873
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,080
trying to chart your team through this

874
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,919
this does allow you and this isn't going

875
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,559
to be necessarily a quick process so

876
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,120
despite me walking through it uh on in

877
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,840
the presentation or can organizational

878
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,000
change takes a long time uh that's

879
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,240
that's the real of it and it's going to

880
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,399
potentially take months or even years

881
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,480
but this allows you to help chart a road

882
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,080
map into

883
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,399
it's generic enough that allows you to

884
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,640
fit whatever you have in it but also

885
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,159
provides guidance in how to move to the

886
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,640
next step

887
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,840
so

888
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,919
with that we have covered all of our

889
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,200
three major

890
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,120
what is what is purple teaming and then

891
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,039
why does it need a maturity model uh

892
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,120
what the maturity model is and then how

893
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,799
we can use it

894
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,600
so any questions thanks for attending

895
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,959
coming to the morning talks

896
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:17,040
[Applause]

897
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,519
oh

898
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,640
all right

899
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,200
uh i would say some so

900
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,279
part of what i like about purple teaming

901
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,360
is that everyone gets to see what we're

902
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,960
doing in real time there's no hiding and

903
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,760
so

904
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,720
one test we ran uh there we figured we

905
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,039
found out and helped our customer find

906
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,279
out they had an 18-hour delay between

907
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,799
when logs were

908
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,120
taken on the endpoint versus showed up

909
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,240
in the site

910
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,360
and so we're doing a ransomware

911
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,799
emulation and

912
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,480
time is critical so that would you know

913
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,720
that's you get a phone call before you

914
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,000
see it in your sim which would have been

915
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,120
a problem

916
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,600
so yeah that was that was probably the

917
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,918
biggest thing that we've seen so far

918
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,679
uh so they

919
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,080
they they're a pretty large organization

920
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,080
and so they had a good team that's a

921
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,600
thing and luckily it was a multi-day

922
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,440
exercise so we like ran everything and

923
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,399
at first

924
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:17,840
well this is going to be rough there's

925
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,360
no detections at all

926
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,279
so we're starting from zero but then

927
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,440
everything started coming in their team

928
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,120
clearly had they had good process and

929
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,760
all and they had good people and

930
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,919
that was you know the nice thing is they

931
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,159
got the um

932
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:33,279
the sizzo

933
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,960
on on the phone or like hey this

934
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,039
happened and that became priority one

935
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,320
was get it done figure out what if it's

936
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,320
an architecture problem get on from the

937
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,799
vendor uh to figure out if there's

938
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,880
something that they can do to help us

939
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,080
with this but

940
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,559
i think driving that change so suddenly

941
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,919
is what was at least good

942
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,480
good question

943
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,799
anything else

944
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,240
i'll still be here afterwards so uh

945
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,000
thanks again for coming and uh

946
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,280
appreciate y'all's attendance this

947
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,239
morning

948
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,239
enjoy
