1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,279
all right welcome to day two of corn con

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,559
uh we have wynn schwartel zooming in

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,320
from nashville

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,920
and uh when

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,599
yes we have some of wynn's books out

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,359
here we're going to have q a

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,080
be interactive with wynn as best we can

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,320
and give away some books

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,920
and wins going to be speaking today on

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,599
securities probabilistic not

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:26,960
deterministic

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,240
get over it

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,519
okay so when i'll let you take it away

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,360
well thank you john i wish i could be

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,360
there uh i don't know if john mentioned

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,600
i was in california and ended up with

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,399
smoke inhalation and smoke inhalation

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,719
uh symptoms are identical to covid so

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,360
that got really exciting for a while and

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,879
i'm sorry i couldn't be there but

21
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,399
hopefully

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,760
next year

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,719
uh

24
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,239
this talk is gonna be a little bit geeky

25
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,920
and the whole point is

26
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,480
uh for you to start thinking a little

27
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,280
bit differently about security and i

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,879
know you've heard that from me over the

29
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,719
years and i'm but i'm going to stick to

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,559
it thinking differently is the only way

31
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,200
we're going to get anything done uh uh

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,760
well uh i'm an engineer i grew up an

33
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,600
engineer my father worked on radar

34
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,600
systems during world war ii my mother

35
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,119
was the first audio engineer at nbc

36
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,680
i started my first tv repair business at

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,320
five and this is the world i grew up in

38
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,000
was looking at things from an

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,200
engineering standpoint and then i got

40
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,360
involved in the professional audio video

41
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,360
the family business if you will

42
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,000
and got involved with complex systems

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,040
very very early in my in my career and i

44
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,960
guess the whole complex systems thing

45
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,840
has

46
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,280
really stuck with me uh over the years

47
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,079
to be able to have a slightly different

48
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,040
view

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,200
and

50
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,280
i have a lot of axioms that i like to

51
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,560
use and

52
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,759
one of the big ones is infinity infinity

53
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,159
is why network security has failed and

54
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,759
i'm going to walk you through

55
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,880
a look at uh security if you will

56
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,479
from a probabilistic view where infinity

57
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,440
does not exist where there is no zeros

58
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,360
no ones therefore digital is not binary

59
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,440
uh if anybody wants to talk uh you can

60
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,840
have it there's also a pdf that i can

61
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,800
send

62
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
to anybody who wants it with all of the

63
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,959
rules of how all of this stuff works

64
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,720
with probably too much math that you

65
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,800
really don't want

66
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,760
so

67
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,959
uh

68
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,720
the real question is is there such a

69
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,560
thing as security

70
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,480
and i am coming more and more to the

71
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,400
conclusion that security

72
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,840
does not exist uh really in any form

73
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,160
and one of the reasons behind that is

74
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,120
can we define security and unless you

75
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,840
can define and measure something very

76
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,519
very carefully uh the

77
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,560
its existence becomes somewhat more uh

78
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,360
obtuse it's not quite as clear

79
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,000
as something that's very hard and

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,800
binary if you will a zero or a one but

81
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,959
what is security there's lots of

82
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,959
different viewpoints lots of different

83
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,080
angles

84
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,640
and i've decided over the years to

85
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,120
really look at security uh from a

86
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,879
completely different view and say

87
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,000
security

88
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,480
let's pretend that word doesn't exist

89
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,400
let's just say there is no such thing as

90
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,040
security but what would replace it or

91
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,720
what can we use and i'm going to use

92
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,920
trust

93
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,560
and trust i'm going to use because it is

94
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,560
relational

95
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,959
if you have one object uh whether it's a

96
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,000
human

97
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,760
system a biological system or a

98
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,239
mechanical system if you have one object

99
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,080
uh there can be

100
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,560
the trust is meaningless it doesn't mean

101
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,720
a thing because in order to have trust

102
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,480
you have to have a relationship of some

103
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,959
sort between objects or subjects

104
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,720
depending upon how you want to look at

105
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,360
it

106
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,879
and whether you're in the physical

107
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,480
domain the cyber domain or the human

108
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,040
domain trust is still about how these

109
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,439
relationships work so if you don't have

110
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,760
any trust then we can't even talk about

111
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,840
security so i want to look at it much

112
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,720
more from the abstract meta view of the

113
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,879
looking at things from a trust

114
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:09,760
now

115
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,200
i'm going to ask a question of the

116
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,519
audience and you can just shout it out

117
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,959
just shout it out so i don't have to see

118
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:15,760
you

119
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,279
um

120
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,880
when you go out for a a drive are you

121
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,400
100

122
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,440
absolutely positive you're not gonna be

123
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,759
in an accident

124
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,080
good i love that i didn't understand a

125
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,240
damn word but i'm saying i think i heard

126
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,759
hell no was that about right

127
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,320
all right cool cool thanks

128
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,440
um

129
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,600
so the odds they've if you're gonna be

130
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,759
in an accident the odds are have to be

131
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,840
greater than zero because it's trust

132
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,160
relationship and it's gonna be less than

133
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,639
one because you can't be 100 positive

134
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,360
that you're not going to be in one so

135
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,560
that is probabilistic in the kinetic

136
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,440
sense

137
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,919
all right are you 100 positive the plane

138
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,639
won't crash

139
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,919
hell no okay that's what i'm hearing and

140
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,800
well probably not because we got some

141
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,919
really good technology uh up there uh

142
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,240
but statistically speaking probabilistic

143
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,880
speaking it's still somewhere between

144
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,240
zero because you have to have a

145
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,560
relationship and one because we're never

146
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,000
going to be 100

147
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,800
positive uh 100 positive you're not

148
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,639
going to get coveted even though you're

149
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,440
all faxed up

150
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,880
right more hell knows so again it's

151
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,880
somewhere it's a probabilistic thing

152
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,240
that's what we've been learning for two

153
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,880
years about all of this and a

154
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,199
probabilistic and statistical analysis

155
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,080
of the odds of getting coveted

156
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,680
and the same sort of thing can be

157
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,320
thought about odds of your network being

158
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,479
infected odds of a phishing or a social

159
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,120
engineering attack working there are no

160
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,800
absolutes at all

161
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,440
uh how many of you would take this ride

162
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,080
oh another hell no whoever that lady is

163
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,600
you you got it you're owning the

164
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,560
audience that's great

165
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,600
because you come through i don't think i

166
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,280
would take this because i've got to

167
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,080
absolutely trust that five fools

168
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,720
on that ride are not gonna start moving

169
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,800
back and forth to think it's funny to

170
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,120
miss that leap again the loop safety

171
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,680
somewhere between zero and one

172
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,560
and

173
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,080
trust is never absolute as we i've

174
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,759
mentioned so you know so there's a trust

175
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,919
spectrum and i don't want to get into

176
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,000
all the details of what it could be or

177
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,520
not be because ultimately when we're

178
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,440
talking about trust it tends to be

179
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,759
situational and

180
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,919
the regardless of the situation

181
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,319
regardless of the domain the human

182
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,400
physical or cyber domains

183
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,599
you're still going to have somewhere

184
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,120
between 0 and 1.

185
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,800
now interestingly enough when you look

186
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,039
at relational trust it tends up

187
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,639
mathematically and i'm not going to go

188
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,800
into too much math in the early part of

189
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,680
this

190
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,720
it's basically the inverse of risk

191
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,960
risk is as definable as trust or

192
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,840
indefinable as trust is because it's all

193
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,400
about

194
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,720
what we have done for many many years in

195
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,319
our field looking at things from a risk

196
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,880
standpoint but never examining it

197
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,880
from the standpoint of how can i

198
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,199
construct how can i look at networks how

199
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,000
can i look at relationships by building

200
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,840
in trust we say we're building in

201
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,759
security that's been the mantra for a

202
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,360
long time and i'm not sure that that has

203
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,000
been as successful as we would like and

204
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,400
perhaps it's a matter of nomenclature

205
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,240
and ultimately some math at the end of

206
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,360
this

207
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,240
so

208
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,840
everything in the world is an

209
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,520
approximation period and the story uh

210
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,759
where we could have a nice beer and

211
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,919
explore some of the abstract stuff but

212
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,520
i'm going to stick with everything is an

213
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,039
approximation

214
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,759
okay and the left upper uh that's a sine

215
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,840
wave what is the thing on the bottom

216
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,560
anybody know what that is on the bottom

217
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,520
left

218
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,840
sorry

219
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
i didn't hear all the words but i'm

220
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,758
going to say barry's wrong

221
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,550
anybody know what that is

222
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,599
[Music]

223
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,520
uh it's called a square wave

224
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,479
and in its most pure form

225
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,919
uh it goes from a zero to a one

226
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,719
but there is no such thing as a square

227
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,440
wave because a square wave in if it was

228
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,080
mathematically perfect would be divide

229
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,240
by zero because you've got an infinite

230
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,399
tangent line and

231
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,160
it takes time so when you look at the

232
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,160
right hand side here of square waves

233
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,399
when you zoom in and look carefully

234
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,120
they're really approximation curves

235
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,600
and it's about granularity

236
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,959
and unless we're going to go into the

237
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,720
quantum world

238
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,360
every instantaneity means absolutely

239
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,320
nothing

240
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,279
so

241
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,920
square waves while we like to think

242
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,600
that they're absolute while we like to

243
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,080
think that a zero and a one are absolute

244
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,920
in our digital trains

245
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,640
they are really approximations even in

246
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,320
the digital world which is why we have

247
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,640
error correction and all sorts of stuff

248
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,680
built into it for this exact reason

249
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,560
now

250
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,800
let's look at physics physics has

251
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,240
two types of physics roughly you have

252
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,880
the newtonian physics classic physics

253
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,200
which is highly deterministic and

254
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,080
everybody uses the pool uh table example

255
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,000
that uh if you hit the queue you know

256
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,600
exactly where it's gonna go if your

257
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,000
measurements are precise enough and you

258
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,399
can look forward in time and you can

259
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,440
look backwards in time as well in order

260
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,000
to be able to analyze events and event

261
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,399
trains and that is

262
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,800
largely in the macro level absolutely

263
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,920
deterministic within

264
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,160
measurably down to 10 to the -12

265
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,920
something like that however at the

266
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,680
quantum scale

267
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,920
everything suddenly changes and without

268
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,160
going into all the quantum mechanics

269
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,680
ultimately we cannot be deterministic

270
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,240
about all of our observations of quantum

271
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,959
phenomena and ultimately it is a

272
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,720
probabilistic view of the universe and

273
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,040
in when we look at some of the phenomena

274
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,480
that occurs yes time travel exists at

275
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,320
the quantum level but not very often and

276
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,279
not

277
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,000
collated enough to be able to become a

278
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
macro event as far as we understand the

279
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,120
physics today there are anti-entropic

280
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,040
types of events that occur in the

281
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,000
quantum world that we can see we observe

282
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
they're mathematically and physically we

283
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,560
know they exist but they don't bubble up

284
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,560
to the macro world

285
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,320
so we tend to say okay it's still

286
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,800
deterministic but strictly speaking it

287
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,000
is not

288
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,320
quantum computing for all of the talk

289
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,200
that we hear about it is probabilistic

290
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
and when we look at the errors that are

291
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,120
built into it into quantum computing

292
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,959
because of second law of thermodynamics

293
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,079
we have incredible amounts of noise in

294
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,959
the system and that requires massive air

295
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,079
correction and again the amount of

296
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,920
accuracy is a probabilistic

297
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,360
determination that ultimately uh feynman

298
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,519
came up with some of the uh

299
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,680
infinite summation of integrals way back

300
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,480
in the 50s and 60s when he postulated

301
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,240
how quantum computing could actually

302
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,120
work so when you do a quantum problem

303
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,680
you're not going to get exact answers

304
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,040
you're going to get probabilistic

305
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,880
answers based upon

306
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,279
all sorts of accuracy and functions and

307
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,600
the engineering that goes into it now

308
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,839
purdue is working on another system and

309
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,360
if you're interested in it they're

310
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,959
looking at probabilistic computers

311
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,680
that'll operate at room temperature

312
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,959
because

313
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,120
a probabilistic computer

314
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,720
is often

315
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,920
close enough so when i'm building in my

316
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,200
old career an electronic circuit and i

317
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,440
need it to be a really good quality how

318
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,279
accurate do my resistors and my

319
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,399
components need to be do they need to be

320
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,040
10 to the minus ninth accurate or is 10

321
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,200
to the minus third

322
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,399
good enough for the application and so

323
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,000
purdue and a

324
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,279
folks in japan are working on looking at

325
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,720
quantum-ish kinds of hard problems

326
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,600
but what is the accuracy that is really

327
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,760
required in order to come up with an

328
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,000
acceptable answer that will provide

329
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,760
something meaningful for the engineers

330
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,680
and scientists

331
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,760
our brains are probabilistic i i was

332
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,360
having a conversation this morning with

333
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,440
a friend of mine about 9 11 because we

334
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,120
were both supposed to be doing some work

335
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,000
in new york and his memory is uh

336
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,839
somewhat different than my memory on a

337
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,800
lot of the specifics because the brain

338
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,959
conflates things it confuses things

339
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,320
because we are probabilistic machines we

340
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,720
average things we weight things and

341
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,160
waiting is so strictly important in any

342
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,720
sort of neural network

343
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,360
digi deep learning networks machine

344
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,959
learning networks and i won't use the

345
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,800
word ai because i don't believe ai

346
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,200
exists and i'm not sure ai ever will

347
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,000
exist it's a great marketing term that's

348
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,079
meant to confuse

349
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,800
uh people that are non-technical

350
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,560
but neural networks are all

351
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,720
probabilistic as well there's weighting

352
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,399
factors and

353
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,160
you may remember

354
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,160
several years ago the

355
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,279
microsoft put out a new a twitter bot of

356
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,920
some sort and suddenly within 24 hours

357
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,399
it became very racist

358
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,480
reason is the weighting factors the

359
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,720
probabilistic inputs that weighted the

360
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,360
functions inside the neural networks got

361
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,560
skewed

362
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,600
by users screwing with the system

363
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,959
so anytime we're using any sort of mln

364
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,199
or even cnn's where we're looking at

365
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,120
deep learning networks and convolutional

366
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,880
networks for learning

367
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,480
they all are probabilistic and often

368
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,760
when you ask

369
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,600
some of these machines especially those

370
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,760
that have not been fully trained yet you

371
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,000
ask them a question

372
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,760
and you get an answer

373
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,240
that answer is probabilistic now you ask

374
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,320
the same question

375
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,959
right again 10 minutes later whatever

376
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,680
you are very likely depending upon other

377
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,360
interactions with that system that are

378
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,839
hidden from your view and hidden from

379
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,560
the network layers down in those uh

380
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,399
inside the networks which are often

381
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,480
thousands and thousands of layers deep

382
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,199
you're going to get a different answer

383
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,480
so

384
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,240
being very careful about what we expect

385
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,920
from the systems in terms of queries

386
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,040
is

387
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,639
something i think that we failed at in

388
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:55,920
security because i think we've been

389
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,360
asking many times the wrong questions

390
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,680
gambling is probabilistic like bill but

391
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,240
we we understand standard deviations we

392
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,680
understand how these curves work

393
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,320
but in security we're still looking for

394
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,279
what

395
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,320
how secure are we and i'm arguing that

396
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,360
question may be very very meaningless

397
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,399
um

398
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,279
in the analog world slide rules um they

399
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,199
were invented in the

400
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,519
1600s in order to be able to quickly

401
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,480
solve uh logarithms and then a b have

402
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,120
applications into calculus the answers

403
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,279
on i grew up on slide rules designing

404
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,920
circuits with them and the answers are

405
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,759
close enough

406
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,240
yet the chinese came up with an early

407
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,560
digital system where they could get very

408
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,040
very accurate numbers to however many

409
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,440
decimal points uh you were going to have

410
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,240
on either side and how they do that i

411
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,279
don't know but it is rather amazing

412
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,440
close enough with analog systems how

413
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,600
close is close enough versus being

414
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,720
digital expecting an exact answer

415
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,320
and the analog system's the one on the

416
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,480
left a lot of this is fire control

417
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,079
systems the military's been involved

418
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,839
with this uh since the early 1900s

419
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,560
fire control systems various types of

420
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,519
military guidance systems camera systems

421
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,040
bombing sites they're all analog because

422
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,560
they're faster

423
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,040
they interface with sensors better

424
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,000
and

425
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,680
they're close enough

426
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,519
so there was all industry of analog

427
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,839
computers for many many years where the

428
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,920
answers could be

429
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,920
good enough for the application do you

430
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,800
need six sigma uh nine sigma what do you

431
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,399
need in terms of accuracy and

432
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,880
i built an analog computer way way way

433
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,680
way long time ago and uh used it

434
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,440
actually to do some math and next to my

435
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,800
45

436
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,240
and it's

437
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,240
working on the analog computer was so

438
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,639
much faster and again it gave me answers

439
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,480
that were good enough

440
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,759
so is your network secure well no of

441
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,880
course not

442
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,959
now we got to get into some of the math

443
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,480
of how we could look at networks

444
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,599
and then

445
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,079
apply a little bit of mathematics and

446
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,079
probabilistic thinking to come up with

447
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,839
some approaches that

448
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,559
are not maybe intuitively obvious

449
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,839
so

450
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,760
is your marriage secure well there's a

451
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,160
curve for that and that curve is based

452
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,199
upon histories and statistics uh the

453
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,799
same thing that we've got

454
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,160
with covid

455
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,039
statisticians use probabilistics in

456
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,880
order to be able to come up with answers

457
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,679
the entire insurance industry

458
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,000
which is a big gamble as well

459
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,640
that is completely probabilistic and

460
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,480
statistically based

461
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,960
so much of the universe that we live in

462
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,400
day to day is based upon the fundamental

463
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,640
natures of probability and some

464
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,640
estimates say more than 50 of the

465
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,720
planet's gnp

466
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,360
is based upon this type of thinking

467
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,240
yet i'm arguing in security

468
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,280
maybe we're not doing that so well

469
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,760
so let's take an example here and here

470
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,919
comes some math and i'm really sorry but

471
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,520
i'm going to keep it as simple as i

472
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,840
possibly can we're going to look at a

473
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,880
basic

474
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,080
probable

475
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,480
probability relationship

476
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,480
probability of d

477
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,240
real simple it's the probability that we

478
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,160
detected an attack

479
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,320
now the probability keep in mind is

480
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,799
greater than zero and less than one

481
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,880
somewhere in that range

482
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,200
and so you could have let's say 0.5 okay

483
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,280
that'd be a 50 50 chance just like we're

484
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,640
throwing dice

485
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,960
uh i'm sorry uh well without a red

486
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,600
blacks on cards or a

487
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,000
dyson a one to three or a four to six 50

488
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,080
50 uh relationships pretty straight

489
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,280
ahead

490
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,320
now

491
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,039
depending upon how accurate i want to be

492
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,039
i can say that that probability of d is

493
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:56,480
.555 so i've got

494
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,720
three significant digits of accuracy

495
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,520
there

496
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,440
that is immaterial to the discussion so

497
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,280
we're going to keep it really very

498
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,600
simple and just use very simple numbers

499
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,400
here so probability of detection and

500
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,480
when we talk about detection devices the

501
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,640
black boxes that the vendors are selling

502
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,679
us uh do they really talk about that and

503
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,200
we're going to look at what some of this

504
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,120
actually means

505
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,080
now

506
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,640
so the probability detecting attack pd

507
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,880
now what is the probability of that

508
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,919
attack

509
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,679
actually it being in progress

510
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,120
separate question

511
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,520
and probability because its relationship

512
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,120
is is relational

513
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,440
we have to look at the value

514
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,799
of

515
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,280
pd detection

516
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,160
given

517
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,600
that the attack is actually occurring is

518
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,080
this am i getting pinged by anybody no i

519
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,679
thought that was gordon

520
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,000
so the value of p d based upon a is the

521
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,440
probability

522
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,000
that the detection

523
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,919
pd

524
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,039
was

525
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,840
actually occurring p a

526
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,240
and underneath of there is the math

527
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,039
that's it it's very very simple it's

528
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,200
multiplication and division

529
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,080
and that's all you really need to know

530
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,240
now let's take a look at some numbers in

531
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,720
this so let's say the vendor says his

532
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,159
detection accuracy is 99

533
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,039
all right

534
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,760
uh let's ignore how he comes up with

535
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,640
that number or he justifies it to you

536
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,919
ignore that

537
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,919
so now let's say

538
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,799
again uh that one in a thousand emails

539
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,039
coming into your organization

540
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,240
uh are malicious or it's taking you to a

541
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,080
bad place and it's just you know it's a

542
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,919
number that we're picking here because

543
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,760
when you're dealing with probabilities

544
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,520
you have to start with an initial set of

545
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,559
conditions

546
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,400
and then work upon

547
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,280
new data as it comes along

548
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,159
so

549
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,919
the probability that this is all

550
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,159
happening is actually 1.1

551
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,240
however

552
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,559
when we look upon it is the probability

553
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,559
of the attack being real based upon

554
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,880
what the vendor's black box product

555
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,280
accuracy tells us

556
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,600
what happens

557
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,039
the math

558
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,840
confuses us it makes no intuitive sense

559
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,600
but it comes down to

560
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,159
for a single detection a single event

561
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,080
we're sitting around nine percent

562
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,159
accuracy

563
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,520
nine percent

564
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,159
vastly different because we have to look

565
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,960
at it over a period of time

566
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,679
now let's take a second event and the

567
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,080
second event same math same conditions

568
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,320
what happens well based upon that and if

569
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,120
the events uh are correlated and they uh

570
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,280
the events occur the same way

571
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,840
our accuracy now goes up to 90

572
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,240
and over time and this is why people

573
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,799
like to train a ml systems and uh and

574
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,640
neural networks

575
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,000
over time

576
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,679
the accuracy can increase

577
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,840
but we also have some other conditions

578
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,200
that are going to make it a little bit

579
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,039
harder to look at

580
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,039
it's a thing called rock and it was all

581
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,679
based upon accuracy of radar detection

582
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,600
for airplanes and sea stuff and it all

583
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,919
came from the military in world war ii

584
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,200
and it's how accurate is my data and

585
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,760
this is where uh

586
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,880
vendors

587
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,039
i'm not entirely comfortable with a lot

588
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,360
of the data they give me about their

589
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,159
detection stuff there's four possible

590
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,039
conditions that'll exist in a detection

591
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,280
network whether you're talking about

592
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,799
probability of d detection or

593
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,039
probability of the attack occurring

594
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,960
and first one tp true positive yep that

595
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,280
was an accurate detection got it

596
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,679
absolutely

597
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,440
faults positive

598
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,960
and that means

599
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,240
uh we detected an attack but

600
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,960
it wasn't real and typically that

601
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,280
requires uh some level of human

602
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,120
intervention depending upon how you have

603
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,679
your systems and sims configured

604
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,320
then we have false negative

605
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,039
and true negative as well

606
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,720
and

607
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,960
all of these are the four possibilities

608
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,960
of what happens with an event detection

609
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,960
so it is obviously not a binary

610
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,520
condition because all of these numbers

611
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,000
are going to consistently change and

612
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,240
they can be plotted out very very simply

613
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,400
in what's called rock space and if you

614
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,559
look over on the right that's taking

615
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,280
some random data just to show where the

616
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,000
ideal conditions are and you want your

617
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,559
sensitivity to be

618
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,600
more accurate over time more samples and

619
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,000
that's in the upper left quadrant and

620
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,120
down in the

621
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,039
lower right things get a whole lot worse

622
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,240
so

623
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,640
there is no real simple just yeah i'm

624
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,360
going to detect it 99 of the time

625
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,400
no

626
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,039
we have to look at those based upon the

627
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,840
relational probabilistic conditions of

628
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,120
other events and other data sets

629
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,520
that we've got in our networks

630
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,559
so

631
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,279
let's look at a real simple network here

632
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,679
and we've got a three nodes okay so we

633
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,159
have the three nodes abc and each of

634
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,799
those nodes has a trust

635
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,279
factor and these are made up numbers to

636
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,360
show you how the systems apply here and

637
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,200
these are just easy numbers

638
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,080
so uh the most trusted one is a that's

639
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,360
99 we really trust a boy

640
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,640
they're great

641
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,760
and then b and c are yeah they're okay

642
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,760
but not great so then we look at the

643
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,679
relationships

644
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,760
between them and look at those trust

645
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,080
factors so let's look at c

646
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,600
uh and b

647
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,960
um

648
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,679
c only trusts b

649
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,400
to slightly less than half

650
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,919
for whatever reason again we're just

651
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,679
showing some of the math here

652
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:02,799
and b

653
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,120
for whatever reason

654
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,400
trust c only 20

655
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,520
only 20 which is very very low despite

656
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,480
the fact that c gives itself an 80

657
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,480
confidence factor of accuracy which

658
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,039
means when you add all this up

659
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,440
there's all the math down there

660
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,240
this

661
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,799
three node simple network now has a

662
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,760
trust factor of just over 50 percent

663
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,679
now what happens when i add and i'm not

664
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,600
going to pour you through the math what

665
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,120
happens when i add another node and

666
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,960
another node and another node now i got

667
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,919
10 000 nodes and i got 100 000 nodes now

668
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,279
i got iphones now i got all this crap

669
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,679
tie into my network all over the world

670
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,919
and all of these

671
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,279
object

672
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,760
trust factors and relational trust

673
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,120
factors

674
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,600
have a severe impact

675
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,679
based upon some simple probabilistic

676
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:58,559
math

677
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,240
on the overall integrity of my network

678
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,640
now let's just mentally do a little bit

679
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,080
of math here

680
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,879
if i've got

681
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,520
various levels of trust

682
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,799
with people we're going to take the

683
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,679
people example here and uh you want to

684
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,840
hire somebody to be your trusted insider

685
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,200
well

686
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
is there such a thing as a trusted

687
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,039
insider

688
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,679
maybe maybe not that really depends so

689
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,840
when you're hiring somebody

690
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,720
uh

691
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,120
how do you establish trust and this is

692
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,520
just one example of how trust can be

693
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,600
used and this could be about a human

694
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,200
could be an object it could be a system

695
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,360
it could be a partner network could be

696
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,000
any object at all in the networking

697
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,559
relational uh environment

698
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,880
and in this case okay what do i care

699
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,360
about my weighting factors

700
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,480
are gonna

701
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,559
apply how much do i really care about

702
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,039
each one so technical competence oh yeah

703
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,799
i want a whole lot of technical

704
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,279
competence yeah and my past job history

705
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,919
matters and references and okay i got a

706
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,320
psychological profile and commitment

707
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,559
life goals but when you apply weighting

708
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,120
factors to it is how much do these

709
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,720
really matter

710
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,480
how much do you care about technical

711
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,440
competence versus other factors and then

712
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,240
you end up with a weighted value which

713
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,039
gives you a trust factor there now

714
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,559
over in case two let's see uh we care uh

715
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,039
less about technical competence

716
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,240
and much more about c commitment a lot

717
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,600
about all your past illegal behavior uh

718
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,960
job history

719
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,960
now we may not agree with that but what

720
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,720
ends up happening is that the weighted

721
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,399
value ends up with a completely

722
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,640
different trust factor if you're looking

723
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,320
in this case to put somebody into an

724
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,600
administrative control uh

725
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,840
place so things are going to change over

726
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,279
time as well

727
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,840
but in this case or in any case at all

728
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,360
you're going to end up

729
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,440
having a weighted network that's going

730
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,480
to change

731
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,640
its value

732
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,240
meaning your answer is going in your

733
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,399
answer is coming out over time so now

734
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:09,840
let's take a look at how this would

735
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,720
happen

736
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,240
in an administrative world or any point

737
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,360
where there is you want additional

738
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,640
security

739
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,919
so ultimately uh we have an awful lot of

740
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,480
organizations that say okay we need two

741
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,799
administrators for three administrators

742
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,000
because to operate the same system

743
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,679
because one guy can't do it 24 7 365. so

744
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,919
we can look at what happens when we add

745
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,600
additional people in this case for the

746
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,960
two-man rule

747
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,679
and if either bob or alice in this case

748
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,080
can affect something in this case it's a

749
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,559
simple or gate we look at it logically

750
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,520
of course

751
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,760
uh the math says that as soon as i have

752
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,840
both either bob or alice can do it but

753
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,159
both are trusted to the level of 90

754
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:56,960
percent we trust bob 90 we trust alice

755
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,360
98 but as soon as we put him into the

756
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,440
same network and either one of them can

757
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,919
have control suddenly

758
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,240
the math shows us that we're down to

759
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,679
an 81

760
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,440
trust we've lost

761
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,360
an awful lot of trust and our risk

762
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,399
factor has virtually almost doubled in

763
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,159
this particular case

764
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,360
so when you end up with

765
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,399
a lot of ore conditions so for example

766
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,240
in a

767
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,399
multiple admins having controls over a

768
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,039
particular system uh the trust factor

769
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,520
starts going down very very quickly the

770
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,320
more people i have that can affect a

771
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,159
particular system same thing with

772
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:37,840
multiple inputs

773
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,120
to a decision making matrix of any sort

774
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,120
and they say well if a if b or c or d

775
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,120
how much do i trust the output in this

776
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,320
case q

777
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,480
the same thing occurs if i have multiple

778
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,399
options on the inputs what's my trust

779
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,279
factor at the end and the math says whoa

780
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,360
you can't do it this way with any high

781
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,360
level of integrity

782
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,159
so

783
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,080
the two-man rule can operate in another

784
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,159
way which is with an and gate that both

785
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,440
a and b alice and bob both have to agree

786
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,840
to make a decision and whether alice is

787
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,080
a process and bob is a process or their

788
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,480
networks or whatever the decision matrix

789
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,440
is

790
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,679
they both have to be there and they both

791
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,360
have to agree

792
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,640
and suddenly under those rules my

793
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,279
trust factor has gone up

794
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,159
by an order of magnitude and that is

795
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,480
tremendous when we look at how we can

796
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,200
configure relational objects in a

797
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,080
network in order to make

798
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,720
trust hopefully building that in versus

799
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,640
building security in

800
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,399
and then there's all sorts of logic that

801
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,240
comes out of this as well because you

802
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,080
have to have the time in it

803
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,640
time is a function that is required

804
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,880
because if we have alice and bob having

805
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,360
to make the same decision and agree on

806
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,480
something uh well what if bob is out to

807
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,440
lunch

808
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,320
and can't agree with alice well what if

809
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,320
bob's on vacation can't agree with alice

810
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,159
so there's a whole time function that

811
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,039
can be uh implemented using feedback and

812
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,120
creating a different type of logic gate

813
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,360
called the time based flip-flop

814
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,000
which shows how the logic works over the

815
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,120
spectrum of time in order to not allow

816
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,440
the alice and bob relationships to

817
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,120
create bottlenecks in the systems

818
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,760
now we can also adjust probability of

819
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,880
this and the

820
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,480
trust factor by adjusting time in any of

821
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,880
these arguments and again it's super

822
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,200
simple math there is nothing complicated

823
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,000
is that multiplying dividing adding and

824
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,720
subtracting that is it with some simple

825
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,039
formulas and what ends up happening if

826
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,200
you look over on the right

827
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,840
that when i change

828
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,200
the value of time and the time value

829
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,279
goes from i have to agree with in one

830
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,480
second

831
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,799
i have to agree in 100 seconds or i have

832
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,600
to agree a degree in 700 seconds

833
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,000
what ends up happening is the trust

834
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,840
factor gets adjusted and the risk factor

835
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,480
goes up and or down depending upon the

836
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,760
amount of time that i allow each

837
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,200
individual relationship to exist and to

838
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,279
continue with whatever decision has been

839
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,679
made again it's not complicated it's

840
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,760
just a matter of thinking it through in

841
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,120
a completely different way

842
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,880
the ob one of the arguments i've made

843
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,159
for many years is the concept of

844
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,120
detection and depth uh i made the point

845
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,720
earlier about probably your plane's not

846
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,960
going to crash and with a really good

847
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,840
reason that the engines the ge engines

848
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,440
are the ones that i have incredible

849
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,880
respect for

850
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,760
each of those big engines the 9000

851
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,600
series on our planes

852
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,640
they've got roughly 5 000 detection

853
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,240
points in them

854
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,960
that are sampling at a minimum of once

855
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,600
every second to look at the behavior of

856
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,919
that engine and the reason it's done is

857
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,760
probabilistically it allows us to

858
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,519
predict the future

859
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,399
so if those engines uh uh sense

860
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,159
something odd here something odd here

861
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,799
something odd here that's causing a flag

862
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,279
to the main part of the uh of the

863
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,360
intelligence and says wait a minute we

864
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,120
may have to shut this engine down

865
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,600
because statistically xyz could happen

866
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,519
this is the same approach i'm advocating

867
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,120
for portions of our network and

868
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,039
especially for coding

869
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,080
that

870
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,399
the relationships are changing so

871
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,960
quickly just like in an engine

872
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,159
they do allow us to predict the future

873
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,159
and the more sensors we have the

874
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,880
detection mechanisms and the more often

875
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,080
i update those that sensor information

876
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,519
and the more that i've gotten those

877
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,000
probabilistic relationships creating a

878
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,679
data set actuarial tables if you will

879
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,679
the more accurate i'm going to be able

880
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,159
to predict the future

881
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,000
so what does all this look like we can

882
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,720
actually graph it out and look at how

883
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,200
your trust factor maybe you want to call

884
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,360
it the security of your network or

885
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,280
security of components of your network

886
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,679
are going to look over time

887
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,399
uh in the uh and the one on the far left

888
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,000
what's happening is

889
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,399
the way that network is configured

890
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,639
as i have no

891
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,719
breaches i have no negative events

892
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,079
occurring the overall baseline for the

893
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,440
trust factor increases over time

894
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,679
and that was a decision that was made

895
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,839
when the tables are built on how your

896
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,399
trust mechanisms are going to work

897
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:37,440
in the

898
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,159
middle one we have a where we want to

899
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,520
keep our trust very very high

900
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,040
so

901
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,639
it's not allowed to fall through the

902
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,599
baseline very often the one on the upper

903
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:50,879
right

904
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,119
that's not so important we can uh

905
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,599
periodically revet it we can do that the

906
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,880
time-based feedback in it but if it goes

907
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,440
down really low for a while at that

908
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,880
circuit is not all that critical

909
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,960
then the one in the lower left is

910
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,800
mission critical because we look at the

911
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,640
number of significant digits that are

912
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,920
sitting there

913
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,760
and it's like whoa damn that's what 10

914
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,440
to the minus well there's the numbers 10

915
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,280
to the minus 10th 10 to the minus the

916
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,520
11th and then we had to invent a

917
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,520
nomenclature to be able to

918
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,599
make have it make sense

919
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,359
and this creates a very narrow band

920
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,640
a very

921
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,000
granular band of i want everything

922
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,599
operating within this narrow band i'm

923
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,599
never gonna hit one

924
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,320
never gonna be perfect but i can keep

925
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,520
raising that bar by keeping that band of

926
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,880
trust exceedingly small

927
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,320
when we apply this mechanism

928
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,240
to a time analysis we end up with a

929
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,240
different set of equations which are

930
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,880
pretty simple and basically it says

931
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,200
if you are able

932
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,640
to operate your network your code base

933
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,560
your relational

934
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,119
networks human cyber or physical

935
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,720
such that

936
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,200
your detection mechanisms are running

937
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,960
faster

938
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,079
than your adversary's ability to attack

939
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,240
and the app and the adversary is going

940
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,400
to use the same probabilistic math he's

941
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,359
just going to use it upside down using

942
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,440
the unknown estimates of what you're

943
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,400
capable of doing in those equations

944
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,520
if he can if you can operate faster

945
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,680
than he can

946
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,520
you're going to win

947
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,400
however the reason we're losing

948
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,640
so much of this is because of the binary

949
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,680
thinking

950
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,680
and we're not looking at it from a time

951
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,560
base

952
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,680
that the time base says if my ability to

953
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,240
detect react mitigate

954
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,200
any of these systems is slower than my

955
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,119
adversary

956
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,280
we lose

957
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,440
very very simple math

958
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,240
very simple probabilistic analysis

959
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,320
and it's something that we have not

960
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,320
bothered to do now you don't need to

961
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,079
know this math you don't need to be able

962
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,320
to run these equations uh there are no

963
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,320
magic tools that are invented yet that

964
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,079
you can plug this stuff into maybe

965
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,760
somebody out there wants the right one

966
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,160
please i'm happy to help

967
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,960
but you need someone on your team

968
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,480
you need someone every company needs

969
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,480
somebody in your team to start being

970
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,920
able to look at

971
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,800
the relational dynamics over time

972
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,640
of networks network components or

973
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,800
anything that has multiple relationships

974
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,760
into it um

975
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,079
some takeaways and some of them are good

976
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,440
some of them are not so good your

977
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,800
network's never going to be secure

978
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,280
period end of story uh there's cyber

979
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,520
insurance and uh there's boating

980
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,280
insurance there's airplane travel

981
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,520
insurance and all of that is because

982
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,599
there is no absolutes and we've been

983
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,680
treating it completely wrong

984
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,119
uh you can calculate the trust factors

985
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,520
uh you're gonna nail it on day one no

986
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,240
because that's a dart throw on day one

987
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,560
over time you're going to be able to by

988
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,359
using these approaches really get very

989
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,040
very accurate

990
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,520
and be able to then notice

991
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,320
changes to that accuracy

992
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,040
by

993
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,359
visualization in this case

994
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:20,960
got to keep in mind that trust is not

995
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,520
static it changes over time

996
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,040
and trust degrades over time because

997
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,760
unless there is a re-verification or

998
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,320
re-vetting of that trust we end up with

999
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,480
aldre james and robert hanson and these

1000
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,359
guys

1001
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:36,960
and sitting

1002
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,720
sweet and pretty

1003
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,400
inside of cia fbi or inside of our

1004
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,800
networks whether it's a human doing

1005
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,400
social engineering

1006
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,400
or the remnants of some hostile code

1007
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,320
that's sitting in there that is uh

1008
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,960
available to the bad guys

1009
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,640
thing i'm going to ask you to do is

1010
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,880
really believe in the math

1011
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,880
science really doesn't care what you

1012
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,800
think or you believe

1013
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,680
science does kind of like mathematics

1014
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,839
and an awful lot of this is pretty

1015
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:09,119
straight ahead looking at networks

1016
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,680
uh you got to keep in mind that

1017
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,680
if nothing else network security and i

1018
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,599
call it it's a bear and this is the old

1019
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,520
story

1020
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,520
there's a couple hunters and they're out

1021
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,359
and along comes a bear and they start

1022
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,760
running and the first guy's running tear

1023
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,079
and ass and the second guy sits down and

1024
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,800
he's changing uh from his heavy boots

1025
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,040
into some uh running sneakers and the

1026
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,640
first guy says

1027
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,640
what's wrong with you well you gotta run

1028
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,920
run run you can otherwise you can't

1029
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,680
outrun the bear

1030
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,680
i don't care i don't have to outrun the

1031
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,440
bear i just have to outrun you

1032
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,520
and that's so the velocity of the hunter

1033
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,960
has got to be

1034
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,680
less than the velocity of the bear which

1035
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,040
is less than the velocity of hunter 2

1036
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,440
and then you can guess it or you can

1037
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,160
look at who is going to win and lose in

1038
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,359
that one

1039
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:01,119
so what can you do now you can measure

1040
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,800
your detection i'll give you the tools

1041
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,720
to do it you can measure your reaction

1042
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,200
you can measure all of these things the

1043
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,000
circuits exist the mathematics exist to

1044
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,520
be able to start getting a handle don't

1045
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,119
do the whole thing you got to start

1046
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,280
somewhere small to be able to get uh

1047
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,359
comfortable with the process

1048
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,680
uh that's a repeat of my axioms that

1049
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,079
i've been living with now for many many

1050
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,079
years is john and a lot of you know

1051
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,800
and so it's all in there please buy it

1052
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,040
uh oh yeah it's it's on kindle as well

1053
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,040
now so it's like i think 10 bucks on

1054
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,440
kindle all my other books are free if

1055
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,520
you're interested in any of those

1056
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,839
and uh thanks uh very much again i

1057
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,359
really wish i could have been there for

1058
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:42,319
this

1059
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,440
but you can actually hear me

1060
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,720
