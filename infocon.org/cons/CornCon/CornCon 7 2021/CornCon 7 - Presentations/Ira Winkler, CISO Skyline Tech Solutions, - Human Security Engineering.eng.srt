the name the the described name was a

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,119
multi-layered approach to stopping

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,920
ransomware or something like that

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,279

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,960

have to okay dude everybody's

17
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,160
so let me start by telling a story

18
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,840
because i've told this story ironically

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,960
i've got this story from county 2017 i

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,920
think

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,879
how many

22
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,120
do people see the the stickers out there

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,520
that say don't click on yeah

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,399
okay

25
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,760
yeah so she had i i'm so happy the the

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,520
12 year old has it don't click on

27
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,559


28
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,559
i'm so happy it doesn't matter it's

29
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,960
irrelevant

30
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,360
you're under 18 it makes me look like

31
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,080
crap okay

32
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,920
but anyway so here's the thing you have

33
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,400
the stickers i say don't click on

34
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,320
and you know so what happened was i

35
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,759
think the first time i saw those

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,119
stickers was in 2017 at corncon or

37
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,960
something like that and what happened

38
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,080
was i flew in that morning

39
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,799
and you know and that and so i always

40
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,560
have to be here for lunch so i was on

41
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,720
the lunch buffet line and there was like

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,680
an admin type guy in front of me and

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,520
he's like walking along hopefully he's

44
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,520
not here now but anyway so the admin

45
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,439
type guy in front of me he sees these

46
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,840
don't click on stickers on the

47
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,119
table of the buffet line and he's like

48
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,280
wow i need a whole bunch of these i've

49
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,960
got a whole bunch of users that keep

50
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,399
clicking on and my reaction was you

51
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,159
must give your users a lot of to

52
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,520
click on

53
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,960
and he's like what do you mean i'm like

54
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,399
well how are they going to click on

55
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,680
if you didn't give them all the to

56
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,719
click on

57
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,079
and he's like

58
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,159
what it's like why are they click i'm

59
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,399
like why are you giving it to him and

60
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,840
anyway by the way if they're gonna click

61
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,599
on it why don't you do anything to stop

62
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,440
the results of it and he was like what

63
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,200
do you mean by that i'm like

64
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,120
he knew what i meant but anyway it's

65
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,040
like a good story i've been telling for

66
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,239
so long

67
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,720
and it's basically the same issue

68
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,800
because if everybody's worried about the

69
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,200
users clicking on

70
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,120
you're the people giving the user

71
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,760
to click on it doesn't why isn't that

72
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,680
clicking in your head

73
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,760
you know the problem is and you know my

74
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,920
book is called you can stop stupid

75
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,440
available at better bookstores

76
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,160
everywhere except for the fact i'm not a

77
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,720
good a poor author to bring some with me

78
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,440
but anyway get my book it's good

79
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,680
but the problem is is that everybody

80
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,760
does it doesn't click in the it

81
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,160
professional's mind that if users are

82
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,840
clicking on they're getting that

83
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,760
 from somewhere that you're giving

84
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,879
it to them

85
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,680
so you gotta start to remember people

86
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,840
clicking on ransomware because again

87
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,239
multi-layer approach to ransomware

88
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,239
they're not going to do this unless you

89
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,640
give them access to the ransomware in

90
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,040
the first place and by saying you want

91
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,599
the quote-unquote human firewall and all

92
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,000
those that other crap that we keep you

93
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,440
know giving

94
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,400
like

95
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,640
making the users into some paragon of

96
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,640
virtue have you met the users they're

97
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,280
not that bright for the most part

98
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,280
so anyway you got to keep these things

99
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,799
in mind as we go

100
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,799
so first

101
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,440
how many people and this is sad how many

102
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,120
people actually remember the twitter

103
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,280
hack from not this summer but the summer

104
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,680
before you know the whole devastating

105
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,959
one where

106
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,239
some criminal mastermind ended up going

107
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,120
ahead and hacking into you know like

108
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,280
like president obama's accounts joe

109
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,519
biden's accounts all these accounts with

110
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,200
tens of millions of followers and

111
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,480
everything like that

112
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,400
and what happened was it was called a

113
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,959
highly sophisticated attack that was

114
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,120
accomplished with highly sophisticated

115
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,439
social engineering tactics

116
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,280
and twitter came out and had this

117
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,680
engineer writing all up about how

118
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,680
everything was really sophisticated and

119
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,840
they tricked their people and all that

120
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,959
but then they're going to give their

121
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,560
users more awareness and they're going

122
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,238
to stop everything

123
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,279
but when everybody started investigating

124
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,960
that what really happened the

125
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,880
quote-unquote criminal mastermind was a

126
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,400
17 year old

127
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,199
now

128
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,120
and this was literally literally the

129
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,280
proverbial 17 year old living in his

130
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,440
basement that you do not have to be a

131
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,080
mastermind for this i think the kid was

132
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,160
stupid enough to get interviews that's

133
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,560
not the sign of a mastermind

134
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,880
and what happens is what did they

135
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,840
actually do it turns out that yes they

136
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,840
just started going around finding

137
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,199
twitter employees on linkedin

138
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,520
randomly contacted them

139
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,199
twitter allowed 20 of their users to

140
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,880
actually have access to the

141
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,520
administrative console and when they had

142
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,560
access you know that's a thousand people

143
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,960
had the random ability

144
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,600
to just change people's passwords with

145
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,919
hundreds of millions of followers with

146
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,560
no multi-factor well at least they did

147
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,199
have multi-factor authentication but

148
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,360
they didn't have any backup and here's

149
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,919
another thing that people forget how

150
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,280
many people remember that in 2018

151
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,400
this contractor you know he left twitter

152
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,280
in 2018 and on his way out he's just

153
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,600
like screw this nobody else is doing it

154
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,120
i'm just going to delete donald trump's

155
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,240
account and in 2018 this guy deleted

156
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,919
donald trump's account

157
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,240
and in that case what did they do did

158
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,320
twitter look at the whole issue and say

159
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,840
how do we prevent this from happening in

160
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,919
the future they're like well maybe we

161
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,520
should have two or three people you know

162
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,919
verify donald trump's password changes

163
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,560
and so on and leaving everybody else

164
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,520
vulnerable to a 17 year old criminal

165
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,919
mastermind and by now you should

166
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,000
hopefully know i'm being very sarcastic

167
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,880
of that

168
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,919
so

169
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,319
anyway let's contrast this with

170
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,240
cloudflare how many people remember when

171
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,199
cloudflare had a major issue

172
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,000
nobody you know i mean this is the thing

173
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,680
you know we have all these wake-up calls

174
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,840
that people hit the snooze button on so

175
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,319
anyway cloudflare had a major issue

176
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,360
cloudflare is one of the biggest um cdn

177
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,120
what is that content

178
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,479
delivery network cdn so cloudflare they

179
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,639
basically host lots and lots of websites

180
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,720
and make sure that all these websites

181
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,639
are available simultaneously around the

182
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,479
world and everything like that

183
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,880
and what happened was there was a major

184
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,120
outage at cloudflare

185
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,800
and in this case

186
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,840
it wasn't some random engineer that got

187
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,680
on twitter and everywhere else that said

188
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,599
here's the update matt prince the ceo of

189
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,000
cloudflare was the one delivering the

190
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,199
messages

191
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,199
and to matt prince's credit when i had

192
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,319
to deal with the guy i think i was

193
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,759
actually a jerk i didn't have to deal

194
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,599
with him for this but i still have to

195
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,240
give the guy respect on this the guy got

196
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,039
on there and said what happened was some

197
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,759
engineer entered the wrong information

198
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,160
in a routing table and that caused the

199
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,400
outage and somebody on twitter replied

200
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,479
back to him saying i'd hate to be that

201
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,840
engineer

202
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,319
and then that prince to his credit

203
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,960
basically replied back saying it's not

204
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,360
the fault of the engineer it's a failure

205
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,440
in leadership that one person was

206
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,919
allowed to make a one-line error and

207
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,400
cause a major outage of the entire

208
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,919
internet for lack of a better way of

209
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,080
phrasing it so what he did was he

210
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,160
essentially called that himself he

211
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,039
called that a failure in leadership

212
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,520
so that i give the guy credit for

213
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,360
so let me start talking about what i

214
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,319
call old school safety science

215
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,000
and this is another thing old school

216
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,639
safety science was basically because in

217
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,800
the cyber security world we think we're

218
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
the we act like we're the first group of

219
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,360
people that ever had to deal with human

220
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,319
error

221
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,319
you know we act like for some reason all

222
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,000
these other professions in the world

223
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,319
somehow are all their users are perfect

224
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,879
just when it comes to cyber security do

225
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,120
users have failings and everything

226
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,759
but safety science has been doing this

227
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,199
accounting has been doing this i'm going

228
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,280
to talk about a bunch of others in like

229
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,080
a few slides in but basically old school

230
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,080
safety science came up with you know

231
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,520
their attitude when they had to

232
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,000
investigate an injury they went ahead

233
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,680
and said why was that user stupid enough

234
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,360
to get himself killed

235
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,520
that was how they used to go ahead and

236
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,240
approach it because safety science is

237
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,200
actually inside organizations because if

238
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,039
somebody injures themselves for example

239
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,958
on a factory production line and they

240
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,039
have to shut the production line down

241
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,120
that's a major outage to the

242
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,519
organization that costs millions of

243
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,399
dollars in cyber security we suffer

244
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,000
death by a thousand cuts and really

245
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,920
don't care but all these other

246
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,160
disciplines say hey wait a second if

247
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,760
there is a major loss we're going to be

248
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,200
able to calculate that and figure out

249
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,360
what does an injury cost how do we put

250
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,880
in money to prevent it and things like

251
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,640
that but again old school safety

252
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,880
sciences what was why was the user so

253
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,839
stupid they focus really on what's known

254
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,760
as the proximity of the error

255
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,640
specifically what is going on with that

256
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,760
user

257
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,800
that caused this whole set of events

258
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,200
and what basically everything was an

259
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,279
analysis of why was the user wrong and

260
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,279
when you start thinking of that when you

261
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,959
look at airplane crashes there's a

262
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,200
difference between why did the pilot you

263
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,519
know aim their plane into the ground you

264
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,279
know that's the way they look at it the

265
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,360
pilots didn't aim their plane into the

266
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,200
ground but that's

267
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,440
what i'll cover but old school safety

268
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,040
science was essentially saying you know

269
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,800
what let's put gas masks on canaries

270
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,480
and you know for those of you that don't

271
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,600
know the analogy the analogy is that you

272
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
know they used to take canaries into

273
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,320
mines and the canaries could die at a

274
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,560
lower concentration of poisonous gas

275
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,560
than people would so if the canary

276
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,000
dropped dead

277
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,760
then in that case everybody should get

278
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,040
out of the mine

279
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,880
now in cyber security we have this

280
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,880
attitude like well all we need are

281
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,720
healthier canaries if we have a

282
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,880
healthier canary we won't have any

283
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,240
problems we'll make the human firewall

284
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,519
but you know again keep this in mind

285
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,000
you know operational problems because

286
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,079
here's the fundamental problems when we

287
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,680
start looking at this

288
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,440
proximity doesn't explain why something

289
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,480
happens a user clicking on ransomware

290
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,079
for example does not explain essentially

291
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,560
how the ransomware got on your network

292
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,880
again you have to give the users the

293
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,000
 to click on before they click on it

294
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,399
and nobody seems to be looking at that

295
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,040
the proximity is doesn't really help on

296
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,839
why that got there medical postmortems

297
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,040
you know i was talking to somebody

298
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,360
yesterday you know in the field in

299
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,200
medicine if somebody dies in the

300
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
hospital they have weekly meetings or

301
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,160
weekly

302
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,320
tribunals i guess you would call them

303
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,040
more and they basically make the doctor

304
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,200
come up and describe the process of how

305
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,560
the patient did and all the other

306
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,800
doctors sit around and say well why'd

307
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,720
you do that why'd you do this why'd you

308
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,519
do that and when safety science people

309
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,800
started looking at the medical

310
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,040
profession they started to realize

311
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,560
something and they started realizing

312
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,720
wait a second

313
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,120
that doctor at the time they made a

314
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,800
decision that cost the patient their

315
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,600
lives that was the right decision to

316
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,480
make

317
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,480
but how did the doctor get into that

318
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,880
position to make that decision and when

319
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,320
they started doing these detail

320
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,800
postmortems they realized that

321
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,920
a hundred decisions back the doctor went

322
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,399
down this path that made that act

323
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,079
inevitable

324
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,000
and so that's when they started looking

325
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,640
there's a whole system in place on how

326
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,160
can we go ahead and make better

327
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,320
decisions earlier in the process that

328
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,680
could essentially save patients lives

329
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,000
now moving on to new school of safety

330
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,720
science in and i'm kind of adopting

331
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,200
these principles you know to

332
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,440
computer cyber security at the moment

333
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,920
but basically you have to look at the

334
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,320
user as much a part of the system as the

335
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,880
computer is and people don't like to

336
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,680
really

337
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,920
think of it that way but basically no

338
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,680
matter how much you want to make the

339
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,560
user into a paragon of virtue the user

340
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,560
is essentially just a single piece of

341
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,680
the system that has to act and basically

342
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,760
interact with the computer system and

343
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,480
potentially cause damage but they have

344
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,240
to do their job

345
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,639
and but what happens is when you apply

346
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,800
the new school of safety science if

347
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,760
somebody injures themselves or somebody

348
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,240
clicks on ransomware that's not a

349
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,560
failure of the user that's a failure of

350
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,800
the whole system if

351
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,040
somebody injures themselves on a factory

352
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,880
floor again you have to look at why was

353
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,360
that person in that position why wasn't

354
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,920
that person better protected why wasn't

355
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,760
that person when they started to injure

356
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,760
themselves why weren't there protections

357
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,399
in place to stop the injury likewise in

358
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,040
cyber security if a user clicks on

359
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,760
ransomware and activates ransomware

360
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,000
that's a failure of your entire cyber

361
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,320
security system and that's how you have

362
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,800
to approach it the proximity of the

363
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,279
action where the user clicks because

364
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,920
it's really easy to blame the user again

365
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,320
though the user cannot click on if

366
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,880
the wasn't in the inbox

367
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,839
the even if a user clicks on ship the

368
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,240
user it doesn't mean the system has to

369
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,120
allow the user unlimited privileges that

370
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,720
any user now has command of the computer

371
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,120
to tell the operating system encrypt the

372
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,040
hard drive and every other hard drive in

373
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,720
the entire network

374
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,880
that's a critical distinction that you

375
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,760
have to understand because this way it

376
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,160
doesn't just take the problem and put it

377
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,480
on the user because if you're expecting

378
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,079
the firewall

379
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,720
the human firewall to succeed

380
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,839
while

381
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,480
tens of millions of dollars of computers

382
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,399
have failed you or tens of millions of

383
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,079
dollars of software have failed you

384
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,839
there is something wrong

385
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,839
and you know how many people have seen

386
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,760
that dave cartoon

387
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,120
you know the one that's added to new

388
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,800
york or where you have in this country

389
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,880
they show a boxing ring and then this

390
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,519
they show in this corner we have tens of

391
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,160
millions of dollars of security software

392
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,480
in this corner we have dave you know the

393
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,240
stupid user

394
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,920
how many people have seen that are few

395
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,760
i hate you but so but the indication

396
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,079
that i hate from that is that it's like

397
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,959
okay this one person can ruin all the

398
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,320
software

399
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,120
that's not what's going on if one person

400
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,880
can ruin your network your network

401
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,880
really really sucks

402
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,040
so you got to start looking inwardly and

403
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,920
figure out why is this proximity the

404
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,920
cause of the whole problem and not the

405
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,560
whole system that that user that one

406
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,160
part of the system

407
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,519
you know interacts with because

408
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,279
i don't know if i have a slide for this

409
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,000
um yet but think of it this way how many

410
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,680
people have ever seen statistics for

411
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,760
secure email gateways

412
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,680
you know secure email gateways besides

413
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,920
of co-fence constantly you know pointing

414
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,880
out you know proof point let this one

415
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,639
attack through

416
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,519
you know and like but basically one

417
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,800
message

418
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,680
in 10 000 is getting through secure

419
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,600
email gateways these days

420
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,000
on the other hand the average user click

421
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,040
rate

422
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,040
in the best of cases according to the

423
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,240
verizon data breach report is

424
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,959
is four percent of the time a user will

425
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,440
click on the message so basically one

426
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,600
out of every 25 users will click on a

427
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,040
phishing message

428
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,040
and now the thing is even if you want

429
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,839
awareness to come in awareness might go

430
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,000
ahead and address that four percent

431
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,199
maybe down to three or three and a half

432
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,000
but your technology is still infinitely

433
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,079
more effective of keeping that attack

434
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,920
out of your company just because the

435
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,000
human firewall is going to fail four

436
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,199
percent of the time on average other

437
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,519
technology is only failing one out of

438
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,680
every ten thousand so keep that in mind

439
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,040
as i go on

440
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,600
uh okay so a lot of people well

441
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,040
many people wouldn't know but i'm a

442
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,680
master scuba diving trainer and part of

443
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,160
what i do you know the first time i ever

444
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,199
heard the expression you can't c-a-m-t

445
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,920
stop stupid was when i was taking my

446
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,240
instructor training the course director

447
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,160
basically you know he's up there he's

448
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,079
like you know you can't stop stupid no

449
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,399
matter what happens one of your students

450
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,800
is going to do something stupid and i'm

451
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,120
sitting here thinking you know what

452
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,600
this whole course we're taking is about

453
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,440
stopping stupid

454
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,360
because when how many how many of you

455
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,240
are dog scuba divers

456
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,839
okay you're the only people i like in

457
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,240
this room at this point but anyway so

458
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,759
you have all these you know when you

459
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,920
look at scuba diving

460
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,680
and scoop instruction you could correct

461
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,680
me if i'm wrong but before you get in

462
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,920
the water you have to take like 100

463
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,160
hours of coursework and that you go

464
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,520
through and you get tested and the

465
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,839
coursework's basically telling you how

466
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,439
to kill yourself

467
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,760
and then once you know how not to

468
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,720
kill yourself in theory then you go into

469
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,959
a like scuba shop the scuba shop says

470
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,799
they re-give you the test just to make

471
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,880
sure you didn't cheat online and make

472
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,039
sure you pass then you go ahead then

473
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,359
they might put you in a pool but when

474
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,720
they put you in the pool they don't give

475
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,720
you scuba equipment they basically make

476
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,280
you get in the pool and kind of float

477
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,280
for 10 minutes and swim like do you

478
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,880
think we really care whether or not the

479
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,240
people can swim that's what scoop

480
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,480
equipment's for you you go underwater

481
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,960
you have air you don't we don't care

482
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,799
but really what it is is to make sure

483
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,080
you're not going to freak out in the

484
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,240
water that's all it is that you're

485
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,480
comfortable and then what before we put

486
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,400
the student in there we check their

487
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,919
equipment we show them how to check

488
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,440
their equipment and then all that

489
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,840
happens and then when we put them in the

490
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,440
water we put them in the shallow end

491
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,120
where it's four feet where all they have

492
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,600
to do is stand up if anything happens

493
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,120
and then if we see it they take them

494
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,360
slowly to the deep end and then you know

495
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,840
do skills over a period of time

496
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,840
and then only then do we take them in an

497
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,200
open water area where this is like clear

498
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,720
you know it's not going to be more than

499
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,280
30 feet deep not more than 30 feet deep

500
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,120
and then when you're doing this and

501
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,799
besides that before i go on you have

502
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,720
there's insurance on these people before

503
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,880
they go in open water we know where all

504
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,480
the hospitals are we know how to call

505
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,840
911 we have medical kits oxygen etc

506
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,840
and even in this case when i'm an

507
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,600
instructor i'm only allowed to take

508
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,080
eight people in or four people if

509
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,120
they're young but eight people

510
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,039
take them in the water and i'm not going

511
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,080
to trust eight people because i have to

512
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,400
work with one person at a time so a

513
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,160
smart instructor is going to go ahead

514
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,160
and if you look carefully they bring a

515
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,640
dive master assistant instructor there

516
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,320
because you might have an idiot like i

517
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,400
had in one of my classes that decided

518
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,480
hey what does it look like underneath

519
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,640
that platform for example where we

520
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,880
specifically tell them not to go but

521
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,880
this is an example of where these things

522
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,480
happen and scuba despite there's there's

523
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,080
an infinite number of ways to kill

524
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,240
yourself in scuba diving i've

525
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,120
experienced at least one of them but you

526
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,000
can go ahead and what happens is scuba

527
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,919
diving is statistically safer than

528
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,200
bowling

529
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,600
and that's actually a true fact

530
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,440
so anyway when you start looking at this

531
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,840
where does the blame fall in safety

532
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,919
science and i'll use safety science for

533
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,840
now where does the blame actually fall

534
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,720
when somebody injures themselves ninety

535
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,320
percent of the time when you do a

536
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,280
postmortem you find that it's not the

537
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,679
person making the mistake

538
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,600
it's the environment around the person

539
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,160
so for example on a factory floor you

540
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,480
might find that like a forklift runs

541
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,120
into a person you might find for example

542
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,679
that equipment falls on a person you

543
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,440
might find something going on where

544
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,520
people bump into each other pieces of

545
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,000
equipment are too hot equipment fails or

546
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,960
something only ten percent of the time

547
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,919
is it a user is it a user action

548
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,559
specifically that results in industry

549
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,559
likewise in cyber security i don't know

550
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,799
about you but i've done stupid things

551
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,440
from out from the outside looking in

552
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,840
because if my computer is running slow

553
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,640
and the cursor's lagging and i click and

554
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,440
the

555
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,440
cursor said looks like it's in one spot

556
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,200
but it's really in another and i

557
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,120
accidentally delete a message or i

558
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,640
accidentally click on a message i

559
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,120
thought i was deleting or whatever that

560
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,960
those things happen

561
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,919
but again it's still 10 of the time and

562
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,520
just using an example when i do

563
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,360
awareness programs for companies i

564
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,360
usually try to meet with the safety

565
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,600
manager and i was walking around with a

566
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,679
safety manager in their warehouse one

567
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,440
day and he was saying he's like you see

568
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,520
these yellow lines here these things are

569
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,200
new we just painted them about two

570
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,280
months ago because what happened was we

571
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,799
had a lot of people that were getting

572
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,960
injured because forklifts would run into

573
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,280
them or they could walk into forklifts

574
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,960
and we decided what we're going to do

575
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,799
was we did a whole bunch of studies and

576
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,400
we decided at the end of the day just

577
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,960
buy a bunch of paint draw lines down and

578
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,799
say forklifts stay on one side people

579
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,360
stay on the other and then finally what

580
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,640
happened was

581
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,559
number of injuries pretty much went down

582
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,799
to zero he's like they think they had

583
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,280
one because they were either the driver

584
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,679
or the person walking where they're on

585
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,200
their iphones and they just were

586
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,840
careless and walked in but this is how

587
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,440
these things really happen in the real

588
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,919
world how people injure themselves how

589
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,840
people basically

590
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,720
create damage on computer systems

591
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,000
but at the end of the day what's that 10

592
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,799
the 10 is carelessness you know and

593
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,240
here's the thing awareness just impacts

594
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,600
somebody who doesn't yet know better

595
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,159
some doesn't yet know better being

596
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,559
careless doesn't necessarily help

597
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,280
somebody who's you know or is not

598
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,360
somebody who doesn't yet know it means

599
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,280
they're just not paying attention blake

600
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,120
ignorance maybe awareness can deal with

601
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,440
that a lack of training yes awareness

602
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,520
that's what it's for it doesn't deal

603
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,280
with malice because when you look at the

604
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,919
verizon data breach report statistically

605
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,880
28 of all insider or 28 of all data

606
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,679
breaches result from insider activities

607
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,760
and a more awareness just helps the

608
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,600
criminal be a better criminal at the end

609
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,480
of the day

610
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,480
so you gotta start thinking that through

611
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,799
but anyway this is where awareness might

612
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,640
fit in but it's still only ten percent

613
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,400
of the problem at the end of the day

614
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,159
richard marshall like a lot of you

615
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,440
weren't here for that so i'll just

616
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,840
repeat this but you know he spoke about

617
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,480
my concept of what it's not my concept

618
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,080
it's something i adopted from counter

619
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,520
terrorism which is you know boom

620
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,360
there's left the boom boom and write a

621
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,760
boom it's a terrorism term left of boom

622
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,000
is what happens before there's an attack

623
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,919
boom is at the point of the attack what

624
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,080
do you do write a boom is how you start

625
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,960
recovering responding and so on

626
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,880
so going into a little bit of detail on

627
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,520
that it's a counter-terrorism strategy

628
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,840
and there's different disciplines within

629
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,679
left the boom boom and ride a boom and

630
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,200
you have different people working on

631
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,520
both sides so for example if you're

632
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,280
going to try to stop terrorism you have

633
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,960
some people who are out there

634
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,559
essentially trying to do protect

635
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,480
prevention and those are people that

636
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,080
might try to figure out who are the

637
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,080
terrorists how can we stop them where

638
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,159
they are before they get here and so on

639
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,919
they have another set of people who are

640
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,480
primarily interested in protection those

641
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,400
people are there for example to harden

642
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,000
buildings they figure out where we need

643
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,320
blocks let's put cement barriers up in

644
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,400
front of buildings and so on and they

645
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,480
look at a different aspect they have

646
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,400
different people who look at boom you

647
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,880
know during the terrorist attack that's

648
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,480
where you get things for example like

649
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,720
hard and cockpit doors you get things

650
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,799
like the um

651
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,159
what do you call it the baggage

652
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,720
containers are bomb resistant so that if

653
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,799
they explode they just kind of can

654
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,640
suppress the blast and everything like

655
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,440
that and a cargo hold inside planes and

656
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,600
things to that of that so that's where

657
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,679
you're looking at the point of boom to

658
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,159
stop it but then when you start doing

659
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,880
response there's a whole set of other

660
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,400
disciplines so the first part of

661
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,640
response is how do you go there there's

662
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,039
like studies done how many hospitals do

663
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,279
we need to be in place you know how many

664
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,039
police how many where can we call in

665
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,720
medical professionals and things like

666
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,880
that simultaneously you also have to

667
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,480
train first responders because these

668
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,400
days let's figure it if i'm saying

669
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,159
i might as well say i mean terrorists

670
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,039
are and you know they

671
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,200
have secondary explosions just like what

672
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,679
happened in iraq a couple weeks ago at

673
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,840
this point where they have the first

674
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,520
explosion and then they wait for

675
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,360
responders to come in and then they plan

676
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,360
for the secondary explosion and when

677
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,000
you're training first responders these

678
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,559
first responders have to know how can i

679
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:51,919
get there to help people that

680
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,279
simultaneously try not to get warded and

681
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,159
be the second target because sometimes

682
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,000
the second target is more valuable than

683
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,760
the first so you've got to start

684
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,200
considering that then there might be

685
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,960
poison gas there might be chemical

686
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,200
weapons and so on even if there's not

687
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,880
first responders still if you see a

688
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,360
person here's a hint if you see a person

689
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,000
lying on the floor you don't just run in

690
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,600
and try to save them like you do in the

691
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,279
movies the first thing you should do is

692
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,240
look around and see is there gas maybe

693
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,400
in some cases there's water on the floor

694
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,000
with like an electrical outlet or

695
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,159
something that can cause electrocution

696
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,039
so

697
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,480
and here's another lesson i learned in

698
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,080
my speaker class what's worse than a

699
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,480
dead diver

700
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,720
two dead doctors perfect

701
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,159
even though you're not diagnosed you got

702
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,159
the picture good for you but then you

703
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,760
know getting people off and resilient

704
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,279
and all that stuff

705
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,360
so anyway let's talk about the concept

706
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,279
in cyber security and ransomware and

707
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,799
everything like that and what i call

708
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,840
user initiated loss because at the end

709
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,559
of the day when we're talking ransomware

710
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,240
let me ask you this question does the

711
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,760
user encrypt every bit on the computer

712
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,000
no the user doesn't sit there and say

713
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,840
okay i'm flipping this bit i'm flipping

714
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,799
that bit the user clicks on a program

715
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,520
the program then has to download install

716
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,760
itself and execute

717
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,240
the user is not causing the damage the

718
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,000
user might have taken an action that

719
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,159
caused a sequence of events

720
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,039
so the user initiated that loss

721
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,480
likewise

722
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,480
it doesn't just have to be

723
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,480
just an accident it doesn't have to be

724
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,559
the user was tricked it could be the

725
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,240
user's malicious

726
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,240
it could be the user's well-meaning but

727
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,559
decided he needed to do something for

728
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,640
example and just to give you an example

729
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,400
of something that is you know people

730
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,159
like why would anybody do something like

731
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,240
this there was a case in the large

732
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,080
investment bank where somebody was

733
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,279
working on

734
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,159
they were

735
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,600
there the type of thing they were doing

736
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,000
trade support in other words like um

737
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,080
traders who do commodities trades and

738
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,240
things like that they go ahead and they

739
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,880
have to process the trades and you know

740
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,440
automating the settlement is kind of

741
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,679
important so somebody was working on the

742
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,600
automation and they decided they needed

743
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,919
to take some data home and work on it

744
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,279
overnight because they were too busy

745
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,400
during the day

746
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,279
and what happened was in this case

747
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,279
luckily for the person the person

748
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,960
deleted a bunch of fields that they

749
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,120
didn't need for it and put it in an

750
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,360
email and sent it to his home account

751
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,520
this is a large investment bank in new

752
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,200
york and those banks really have it

753
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,760
locked down so daily prevention caught

754
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,080
it and once the daily prevention caught

755
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,799
it the guy was called into the security

756
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,279
office the next morning when he got in

757
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,440
and basically they were like why did you

758
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,480
do this

759
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,559
and he was in tears they didn't fire him

760
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,120
because he was at least he could show he

761
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,279
took away the sensitive data he didn't

762
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,520
need but it was still

763
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,440
the user did something

764
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,399
for

765
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,440
not even a good purpose in theory

766
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,360
but there was a potential loss there

767
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,159
that if it wasn't stopped so here's the

768
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,000
issue when i look at lost when i look at

769
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,679
the user i refer to it as user

770
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,159
initiating loss because i don't care why

771
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,159
it happened when i was trying to respond

772
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,960
to it initially i don't care how it got

773
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,360
well i do care but i care how is the

774
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,520
user put into that position

775
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,159
why did the user essentially not why but

776
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,360
more how

777
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,840
and then how can it be prevented but

778
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,240
it's not the user needs more awareness

779
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,520
because that's not

780
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,679
the answer for the most part so let's

781
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,679
talk about writing boom and try to stop

782
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,000
boom being ransomware

783
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,919
you want to prevent the user from being

784
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,600
in a position to initiate this

785
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,760
ransomware loss and how do you

786
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,600
essentially do that

787
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,520
you go ahead and you start filtering it

788
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,279
out if you're doing things really

789
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,279
proactively i'm going to have a diagram

790
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,320
you know you're working with the

791
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,159
anti-fishing working group you're using

792
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,480
dmarc you have good email filters and so

793
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,399
on so you start filtering out the

794
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,559
attacks before it gets to the user i'm

795
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:49,840
going to go through this in a little bit

796
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,840
more detail but anyway

797
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,240
every phase that left the boom you also

798
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,039
have the concept of prevention detection

799
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,960
and reaction there because you can

800
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,640
prevent the attacks you should also

801
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,039
detect when bad things are coming in so

802
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,039
in order to be more diligent and react

803
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,120
to other attacks you might not be

804
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,279
proactively seen so that's on the

805
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,200
critical side of what to do you know you

806
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,520
could also create a security culture how

807
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,520
many people heard my nsa story where my

808
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,919
co-workers took my badge

809
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:18,880
yeah

810
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,919
okay so a few people how many did

811
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:22,799
okay

812
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,960
you're going to be bored now so anyway

813
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,840
um

814
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,520
so what happened was when i worked in

815
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,720
nsa um you know i was working 24 hours

816
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,840
24 7 shift work and i was like at work

817
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,919
like three in the morning a report came

818
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,159
in we were using a mechanical plotter

819
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,080
and the plotter essentially had an arm

820
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,520
that moved around so i had to take my

821
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,080
badge off to use the plotter and then

822
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,840
what happened was

823
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,360
you know i finished putting out the

824
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,000
report ran into the restroom as i'm in

825
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,559
the hallway a guard stops me like looks

826
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,039
at me goes where's your badge i'm like

827
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,640
i guess it's in my office he's like

828
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,559
we're going to your office i go you're

829
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,640
not allowed anywhere near my office he's

830
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,399
like i'll wait by the door

831
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,399
so anyway then he's waiting by the door

832
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,159
i go over to the plotter

833
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,320
and i can't find my badge i'm looking

834
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,000
under and i'm looking around i'm looking

835
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,240
at my work normal work desk and my

836
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,000
co-worker says like are you looking for

837
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,279
something ira i'm like where sorry i've

838
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,080
already

839
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,520
you know broke the

840
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,080
seal on this but you know you know it's

841
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,240
like i'm like where's my badging

842
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,200


843
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,640
and he's like

844
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,159
and he's like what the one that

845
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,320
should am i giving my badge and

846
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,480
the guard is is there a problem here do

847
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,960
you think i ever forgot that badge again

848
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,039
in my entire nsa career no i never did

849
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,679
that because the culture was reinforcing

850
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,919
of wearing a badge where if you didn't

851
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,480
wear your badge they went through hell

852
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,640
so anyway and this is called i guess the

853
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,039
concept is shaming or that's the

854
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,360
technical name shaming people say oh you

855
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,960
don't want to shame the user i'll tell

856
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,200
you one thing a shaming in an

857
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,559
appropriate way is going to be the most

858
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,080
effective awareness lesson you could

859
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,600
ever give a person

860
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,440
so anyway now let's talk about

861
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,279
governance because here's the thing in

862
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,840
cyber security we look at governance as

863
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,919
that annoying set of documents that we

864
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,919
have to write that you put on the shelf

865
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,000
and that they you know you only show to

866
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
the auditors before they you know when

867
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,679
they come once a year to look at your

868
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,159
documents governance should detail

869
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,440
specifically how you do your job it

870
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,480
should detail specifically how a user is

871
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,840
supposed to do their job so for example

872
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,679
if

873
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:32,559
i'm

874
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,720
trying to give a nonsensive example but

875
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,120
let's say i'll just i'll reflect the

876
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,440
story somebody told me yesterday

877
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,600
let's say you're sitting here and the

878
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,559
user gets a document in from you know

879
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,960
it's a legal document that they got in

880
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,960
and the user says oh here's a settlement

881
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,200
sheet we need you to review this and the

882
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,200
user is like oh it's a settlement sheet

883
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,440
let me open this up and look at it

884
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,679
really the process should be a

885
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,000
settlement sheet's a legal document they

886
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
need to send that through the internal

887
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,080
procedures so that the right legal

888
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,640
department people get that and they

889
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,600
review it it should not be the job of

890
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,640
like uh

891
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,320
of a new person to look at a random

892
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,640
legal document and figure out what to do

893
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,799
with that document so there should be a

894
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:21,519
process that all legal documents go to

895
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,440
you know so you know go to the legal

896
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,360
department how many people have ever

897
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,200
worked with um accounts payable

898
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,880
departments

899
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,559
because if you've done that you probably

900
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,799
know accounts payable fraud is a big

901
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:33,760
problem

902
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,760
not only is accounts payable fraud a big

903
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,320
problem it's also a primary fishing

904
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,039
target voice fishing

905
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,279
for ransomware delivery because what

906
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,640
happens is

907
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,200
somebody some bad guy will go ahead they

908
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,600
know accounts payable generally has to

909
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,679
go ahead and look at you know pdf and

910
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,840
other documents and open them up but

911
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,519
what happens is most

912
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,480
organizations now have an invoicing

913
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,880
system and the invoicing system has to

914
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,360
receive it that's why it says invoices

915
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,159
you know accounts payable at company.com

916
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,519
because that system filters out not just

917
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,519
enters it into the system but filters

918
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,760
out potentially malicious attacks but

919
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,240
what will happen is people will go ahead

920
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,240
call up accounts payable and say hey i

921
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,240
have an invoice that's more than 60 days

922
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,240
overdue can you look in the system and

923
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,080
somehow say oh we don't have you on the

924
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,240
system it's like really what's your

925
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,840
email address because if i have your

926
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,000
email address i'll go ahead and email it

927
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,679
to you right now while we're on the

928
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:32,720
phone

929
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,120
and that's a common attack in accounts

930
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,960
payable departments

931
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,880
so what happens is you go ahead and

932
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,880
email that in and you open it up and

933
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,120
it's a malicious files you know lock set

934
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,519
sets off ransomware you don't want that

935
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,679
but if the users know the first thing

936
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,679
i'm supposed to do is if somebody calls

937
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,000
up and wants to email me an invoice they

938
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,679
have to send it to accounts payable

939
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,080
period there is no thing but if there's

940
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,919
something at the ordinary you know i

941
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,679
talked about when i was in the marines

942
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,799
it was uh general order number

943
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:03,679
nine

944
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,679
you know i think it's nine you know call

945
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,679
the corporal of the guards when a

946
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,879
situation outside of instructions arises

947
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,560
something like that you don't give the

948
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,239
user discretion you say if something's

949
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,239
out of the ordinary call the corporal of

950
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,679
the guard something out of the ordinary

951
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,520
call your manager you don't have the

952
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,000
approval to start doing things and

953
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,239
that's okay

954
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,560
anyway but governance is key boom what

955
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,159
do you do when the user is presented

956
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,639
with the opportunity to initiate a loss

957
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,560
do they do it do they detect it report

958
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,560
it and so on there's a whole bunch of

959
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,560
things but remember the user can

960
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,040
initiate the loss by accident because

961
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,359
they're careless malicious willful

962
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,000
whatever the case is it doesn't matter

963
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,480
when i'm a security professional i don't

964
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,119
care why a user did something that is

965
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,679
potentially going to cause damage i need

966
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,079
to proactively know what is the

967
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,159
capability and here's the thing you all

968
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,200
know and if you don't know what is the

969
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,079
case

970
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,680
sorry if you don't know you should find

971
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,480
out because you your users can only do

972
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,400
things you give them the privileges to

973
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,720
do if you give them a computer you're

974
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,560
giving them access you need to know what

975
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,720
that access is what they can do and so

976
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,359
on and if you know that you know what

977
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,119
damage they can initiate it's not like

978
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,040
there's an infinite number of choices

979
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,079
they have

980
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,240
they can only do what you have given

981
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,400
them the privileges to do whether you

982
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,920
know you get rid of the privileges or

983
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,520
not

984
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,359
but anyway it comes back to policies and

985
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,520
governance i'm sure most

986
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,880
all of you have kind of had to take

987
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,880
awareness training right

988
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,240
at some point

989
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,640
how many of you have ever come away with

990
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,560
the feeling it's like you're talking and

991
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,720
you're being afraid you're being told

992
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,359
there are bad people out there

993
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,200
and what happens is when you look at

994
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,200
this you're basically what i call

995
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,280
creating number fives if you don't know

996
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,680
who amplified is i i edit you to the

997
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,560
list of people i hate but elder fun it

998
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,160
should be even the 14 year old should

999
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,079
know even they just had the new space

1000
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,280
jam come out but elmer fudd was always

1001
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,680
on the lookout for the waspley wagon and

1002
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,520
if you ever watch bugs buddy if bugs

1003
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,839
bunny put on a wig and a dress elder

1004
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,560
fudge couldn't recognize bug's body

1005
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,040
that's right i'm not making that up

1006
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,440
but that's your users you're basically

1007
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,520
saying a user gets an email saying i'm

1008
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,000
the ceo i need you to do something and

1009
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,880
the user we're training the user to say

1010
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,280
huh is this the hacker i've been told

1011
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,839
about or is this really the ceo that's

1012
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,079
not the question they should be asking

1013
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,040
what the

1014
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,359
question they should be asking is this

1015
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,520
is asking for pii

1016
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,880
what is the process for releasing pii to

1017
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,440
somebody else even if it's the ceo or

1018
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,480
not

1019
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,960
and the process for releasing pii is i

1020
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,320
don't have the ability to the

1021
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,640
authorization to do that i have to give

1022
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,800
it to my manager so you're not there

1023
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,119
because think about it this way in

1024
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,560
general when we're talking about

1025
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,960
ransomware and all these other sorts of

1026
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,440
things we're essentially saying

1027
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,920
that you're dealing with nation states

1028
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,640
you're dealing with sophisticated cyber

1029
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,480
gangs that are know how to wander a

1030
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,880
million tens of millions of dollars and

1031
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,160
things like that

1032
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,280
if your security program has what's

1033
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,280
another phrase i hate the user is your

1034
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,000
last line of defense if your security

1035
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,720
program relies upon the user being your

1036
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,119
last line of defense against a highly

1037
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,079
skilled criminal and or sociopath you

1038
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,599
have lost

1039
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,160
because that criminal sociopath is going

1040
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,960
to eventually win at some point in time

1041
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,280
you might get lucky but the right way to

1042
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,000
do this as opposed to telling people the

1043
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,160
thousand things to be afraid of you

1044
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,160
should be telling people what is the

1045
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,880
right way to do their job properly and

1046
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,200
if it involves downloading files the

1047
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,599
answer is no if it involves giving out

1048
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,800
sensitive information the answer is no

1049
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,520
elevate this to somebody else or somehow

1050
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,599
oh but i did know so i should say that i

1051
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,760
once had a user and and here's where you

1052
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,320
know cecil said should be fired i once

1053
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,359
had

1054
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,680
a user sent a message to their security

1055
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,680
department and said this looks like it

1056
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,599
could be you know just ransomware or

1057
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,599
something and the ceso looked at and

1058
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,400
said

1059
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,480
you know and basically said yes somebody

1060
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,160
sent this to me can you open it up and

1061
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,359
check it out

1062
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,280
and literally they set off this cso

1063
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,160
caused the ransomware to be set off

1064
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,280
um anyway i won't name that company but

1065
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,960
they're a big target

1066
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,320
um

1067
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,200
so anyway you got ryder boom under ryder

1068
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,760
boom at some point the loss has been

1069
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,400
initiated i don't care why the loss has

1070
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,119
been initiated but there has been a set

1071
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,839
of events that is causing a potential

1072
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:47,119
loss to potentially be initiated now

1073
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,599
does the environment expect it again you

1074
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,480
should expect the user to potentially do

1075
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,280
something you know the capabilities of

1076
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,599
an individual user you should be looking

1077
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,440
for that you know do you have

1078
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,760
protections for like can a user

1079
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,760
potentially download file

1080
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,400
if they can then you set on protections

1081
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,720
and say okay we're going to sandbox it

1082
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,320
we're going to put dlp we're going to

1083
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,920
put empty malware we're going to do a

1084
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,079
whole bunch of stuff but you look at

1085
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,240
what the user can do and start layering

1086
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,079
protections in that way

1087
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,720
so anyway can everybody see that clearly

1088
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,200
i don't know how it looks from your side

1089
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,520
so here's time oh very good i'm happy

1090
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,760
with this so anyway let's look at

1091
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,920
stepping through and i don't know if my

1092
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,880
can you see my cursor move around here

1093
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,079
no no

1094
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,240
okay and i don't have a laser pointer

1095
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,400
either so i'm gonna talk through this so

1096
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,640
when you start out at point zero how

1097
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,440
does ransomware get on a system

1098
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,400
ransomware some malicious actor has to

1099
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,400
go ahead they have to have a botnet or

1100
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,720
something like that to send messages

1101
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,960
around the internet or so on there's

1102
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,560
another one and potentially doing like

1103
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,560
watering hole attacks and malicious you

1104
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,079
know creating malicious websites but

1105
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,240
let's just focus on the fishing aspect

1106
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,760
because this is where most of it tends

1107
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,720
to come from so basically the malicious

1108
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,560
person is on the internet they work the

1109
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,400
bot that's the botnet send it out if

1110
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,599
you're working with the anti-phishing

1111
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,520
working group potentially you can start

1112
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,599
blacklisting them then against the

1113
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,440
perimeter devices if you're looking at

1114
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,680
the perimeter devices if you have dmarc

1115
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,760
for example load enabled on those

1116
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,000
systems you should potentially be able

1117
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,800
to filter those out then once it gets

1118
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,560
through your perimeter then you have

1119
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,319
your mail server your mail server should

1120
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:29,839
have empty phishing it should have empty

1121
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,520
malware should be looking for

1122
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,280
attachments and a whole bunch of other

1123
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,160
things

1124
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,400
then from that point then it gets to the

1125
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,520
email client most email clients there's

1126
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,280
usually at least there's the empty

1127
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,839
malware that's on this on the email

1128
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:45,920
client there's also anti-phishing that's

1129
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,520
on the email client

1130
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,760
and so what happens is you have a user

1131
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,319
interface at this point i'm going to

1132
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:53,920
have a more detailed

1133
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,640
uh graphic of how to logically address

1134
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,040
the layers of the second but now we're

1135
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,359
at the user experience and the user is

1136
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,280
essentially now looking either at their

1137
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,800
inbox or their spam folder at that point

1138
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,119
the user then has to make a decision on

1139
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,760
how they go ahead and interact with this

1140
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,079
now when they make the decision this is

1141
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,079
where awareness could potentially come

1142
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:16,880
in

1143
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,560
you know but awareness should be driven

1144
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,800
by policy which says you know we need to

1145
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,880
have you know awareness training the

1146
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,720
awareness training should focus on how

1147
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,200
to do the jobs right the procedures

1148
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,839
should define how do they evaluate email

1149
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,839
messages correctly not to be afraid of

1150
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:34,640
that big bad tricky hacker and then once

1151
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,480
they have that then they have the

1152
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,560
awareness is imparted on the user on how

1153
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,640
to do their job properly not what to be

1154
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,960
afraid of in the ideal world

1155
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,920
then you also have the concept of nudges

1156
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,480
what nudges are are those are little

1157
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,440
inklings of behavior triggers so for

1158
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,680
example and i'm i'm sure most of you

1159
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,079
have seen this message originated from

1160
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,480
outside the company that's an example of

1161
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,160
a nudge somewhere advanced email filters

1162
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,000
tend to have like you know this is a

1163
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,560
first time sender this is a you know

1164
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,720
this is coming from an unknown source

1165
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,560
and so on this doesn't look like it's

1166
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,000
coming from the right place so you can

1167
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,240
go ahead and have all those nudges

1168
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,160
embedded to help the user make the right

1169
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,160
decision and just for the sake of

1170
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,160
argument i also have the user going to

1171
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,240
social media because social media for

1172
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,800
example like your linkedin profile helps

1173
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,440
people helps criminals target them so

1174
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,200
maybe giving people the right guidance

1175
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,599
on how to use you know social media can

1176
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,839
help that as well but anyway let's say

1177
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,079
the user decides to potentially click on

1178
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,920
a ransomware message

1179
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,560
then you go back into the user

1180
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,119
experience the user experience then goes

1181
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:45,280
ahead and says wait a second

1182
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,960
this doesn't look like the right thing

1183
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,960
you should be doing and then the user

1184
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,800
says you know what i still want to do

1185
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,520
that

1186
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,599
and this presentation

1187
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,560
really your job is not giving canary's

1188
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,680
gas mask your job is not creating the

1189
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,359
human firewall

1190
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:04,400
your job is saying we have a problem the

1191
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,160
problem with canaries is not that

1192
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,839
canaries die

1193
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:09,680
the problem with canaries is that

1194
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,560
there's a leak there's poisonous gas in

1195
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,839
the entire system and the canary is just

1196
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,440
the symptom

1197
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,160
of the entire failed system

1198
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,359
that's your users giving users a gas

1199
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:25,280
mask and saying we are making the human

1200
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,160
firewall does absolutely nothing in

1201
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,079
allowing the attack because again if

1202
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,240
you're relying upon the human firewall

1203
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,520
that fails four percent of the time

1204
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,839
which in any strategy whatsoever is

1205
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,599
horrible you have failed as a security

1206
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:42,880
professional

1207
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,680
hey

1208
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,200
oh but if you really get nothing out of

1209
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,119
the presentation bye bye

1210
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:48,800
um

1211
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,920
anyway any questions

1212
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,800
okay give up prizes and everything have

1213
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,599
a lovely day bye
