uh next up we have kate kuhn in our talk

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,800
on invisibility can't be zero when

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,119
talking trust and she works for vr

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,640
uh so if you can give a nice big round

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,000
of applause for kate thank you

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,760
i like to walk and talk so we're gonna

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,399
go this way

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,000
so first of all i want to introduce you

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,360
to somebody

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,920
this is zero trust baby

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,079
uh as you can see

21
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,640
i'm his sidekick i'm a hacker

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,120
he is seven weeks old

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,000
and

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,920
you can follow him on twitter

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,879
at zero trust baby and he tweets about

26
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,960
all things zero trust

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,519
so i have been in security for 25 years

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,520
and i have done everything from

29
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,439
engineering sales

30
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,680
i've gone to the dark side and been a

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,280
i've gone to the even darker side i've

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,960
been a ceo

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,560
and i love all aspects of security

34
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,040
and there's always a buzzword

35
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,720
so when john and i were talking about

36
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,400
what i could give a talk on i was like

37
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,799
how about i give a talk on probably the

38
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,640
biggest buzzword of buzzwords out there

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,240
right now in xero trust

40
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,560
has anyone heard of zero trust

41
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,759
has anyone not heard of zero trust

42
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,200
does anyone really know what it is

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,320
so today we're going to cover a couple

44
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,159
of things we're going to cover

45
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,119
one

46
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,759
what really is zero trust

47
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,280
two

48
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,479
what should we think about and consider

49
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,360
on the journey of zero trust

50
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,840
and why is euro trust so important today

51
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,360
what are the market conditions and the

52
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,759
factors that are causing us to want to

53
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,759
understand and have implementation of

54
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,920
zero trust and last but not least what

55
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,200
are some of the pitfalls and things we

56
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,200
should be thinking about if we're going

57
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,038
to actually implement a zero trust

58
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,239
strategy

59
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,360
so the reason i have exploited my poor

60
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,120
fifth child into

61
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,840
zero trust baby is when you think about

62
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,040
it there's a lot of correlation between

63
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,720
an organization's cyber maturity

64
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,560
and our own maturity

65
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,120
so ken in here zero trust baby

66
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,280
is seven weeks old

67
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,560
he trusts

68
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,400
everything in his life at this point

69
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,760
like if i picked him up and handed him

70
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,239
to you he would go right yeah as an

71
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,319
infant you trust everyone

72
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,480
just like when you are starting out in a

73
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,000
security model

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
you would like to be able to trust all

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,840
of your employees you would like to

76
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,080
believe that everyone that has access

77
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,800
has access for good reason

78
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,200
and it's as you start to mature

79
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,959
you know those first things all of a

80
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,159
sudden your two-year-old doesn't want to

81
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,599
sit on santa's lap because santa's

82
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,280
terrifying

83
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,159
then you have you you get a little older

84
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,159
and don't talk to strangers

85
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,000
never talk to a stranger

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,840
you start to push that trust out of them

87
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,080
organizations are the same way

88
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,000
if you think about it you have that

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,519
first breach and you're like oh my gosh

90
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,120
i gotta lock everything down okay well i

91
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,040
laugh too much maybe i'll i'll step back

92
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,000
a little bit

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,280
you know maybe we only trust these

94
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,959
people or this group

95
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,799
and then as you get older and you become

96
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,000
an adult

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,760
you need three forms of identification

98
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,519
and two-factor authentication before you

99
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,599
talk to anybody right

100
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,480
you go totally the other way with it

101
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,760
and we're seeing organizations do that

102
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,159
so why well a couple of things

103
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,879
there have been any branches this year

104
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,120
big

105
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,760
i know it's been a really slow year this

106
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,360
year i've been getting a lot of sleep

107
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,280
it's amazing

108
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,159
no there have been a ton of mainstream

109
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,400
breeches and i'd love to say what's old

110
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,040
is doing what's old in cyber security i

111
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,040
have seen more supply chain breaches my

112
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,400
favorite type of breach where they get

113
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,640
in and pass things and then sell code

114
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,840
and do all sorts of crazy stuff

115
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,159
we're seeing a lot of

116
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,640
breaches that are causing us to look at

117
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,798
two things one

118
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,959
who has access to what

119
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,918
until we really know where things are

120
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,080
hence enter zero trust and for the old

121
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,280
people

122
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,199
like myself

123
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,120
it kind of reminds me of something

124
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,810
called least privileged access

125
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,639
[Music]

126
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,280
yeah i i've seen the nuts like i had a

127
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,880
long conversation for about two hours

128
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,560
with my good friend dave fairman we're

129
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,160
like this is just this privilege access

130
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,759
on steroids and somebody's made a better

131
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,280
turn up

132
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,240
so

133
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,919
here's the other market conditions that

134
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,520
are going on right now

135
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,639
anyone wanted to take a guess a year ago

136
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,160
a breach would cost an enterprise

137
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,800
organization one million dollars

138
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,240
how much do you think it's costing today

139
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,880
on average

140
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,800
3.37 million

141
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,880
cyber insurance premiums are going up

142
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,960
because of it

143
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,320
anyone want to know what is the

144
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,880
percentage increase in the last six

145
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,199
months

146
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,400
35

147
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,520
and here's the last one

148
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,600
there has been a huge rise of a very

149
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,759
specific type of malware that you can

150
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,160
now download onto your phone and have an

151
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,280
sla around did you know that

152
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,520
what type of am i talking about

153
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,600
ransomware there you go

154
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,520
that boat acre that kills systems and

155
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,720
costing millions and millions of dollars

156
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,120
what do you think the average cost of a

157
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,360
ransomware attack is right now to pay if

158
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,919
you're going to pay it

159
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,360
those that run my new school thing this

160
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,120
morning aren't allowed to answer 345

161
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,360
220 000 per child

162
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,240
yeah

163
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,950
so

164
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,319
[Music]

165
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,400
this is why we should trust no one

166
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,199
so

167
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,479
if we're going to trust no one

168
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,120
the interesting thing is it's the first

169
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,240
time in response that we're seeing the

170
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,479
government really start to take notice

171
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,880
of cyber security matters

172
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,960
and

173
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,160
it was interesting because we're going

174
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,240
to come back to this that in may of this

175
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,520
year we saw the first executive orders

176
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,880
not only

177
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,160
really mandate and push zero trust

178
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,160
and use a buzzword in the government

179
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,319
something we don't usually see

180
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,280
but also we see

181
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,759
all of the five eyes

182
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,440
following suit

183
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,919
and this became the kicking point of

184
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,319
companies from an enterprise perspective

185
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,240
starting to think about executing zero

186
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,600
trust

187
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,240
so the interesting thing is how many

188
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,560
enterprise companies if we pulled a

189
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,120
thousand do you think right now will be

190
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,319
executing the zero trust

191
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,440
not all that far strategy

192
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,759
so right now if we did on 451 research

193
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,080
out of a thousand companies pulled only

194
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,560
13 say they have a fully executed zero

195
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,280
trust strategy

196
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,840
now here's the first thing they call it

197
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,560
a solution

198
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,160
hold that point

199
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,919
but there's 50

200
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,840
plus of companies that say they're going

201
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,520
to do it in the next they're planning to

202
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,000
deploy in the next 12 to 24 months

203
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,840
somewhere in there

204
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,080
so between now and the next two years

205
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,960
they're gonna have a zero trust strategy

206
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,360
hence enter every single vendor out

207
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,479
there right now

208
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,120
trying to sell something

209
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,639
yep

210
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,879
so let's kind of paint the picture of

211
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,560
this talk then

212
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,160
we have

213
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,680
massive rise

214
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,680
in criminal activity and hacker activity

215
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,120
going on right now

216
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,879
we have

217
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,039
we're not quite sure yet why the rise is

218
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,160
happening

219
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,560
we have the government stepping in and

220
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,599
saying you must think about zero trust

221
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,080
and you have a number of organizations

222
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,440
trying to implement zero trust

223
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,919
so the question is

224
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,919
what are

225
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,639
the current state issues

226
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,400
well if you're an organization and

227
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,000
you're trying to

228
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,479
put forth a zero trust strategy

229
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,960
you're running into some pretty big

230
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,958
roadblocks if you're trying to also

231
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,039
address the risk of the day

232
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,080
first thing

233
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,599
what are we seeing in the supply chain

234
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,719
tax lack of visibility is equaling

235
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,399
risk

236
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,720
exploitation in areas they didn't know

237
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,000
they had

238
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,760
second thing

239
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,600
agent-based products

240
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,519
anyone know the average amount of

241
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,959
solutions in an enterprise estate

242
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,720
80

243
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,880
80 security tools

244
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,880
a lot over agent based

245
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,600
so so do the slow deployment of patches

246
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,399
of new solutions of new endpoint agents

247
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,839
are causing

248
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,800
major roadblocks not only integrations

249
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,959
but in the ability to migrate to new

250
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,360
technologies that would help mitigate

251
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,680
the risk

252
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,519
we're seeing unmitigated permission

253
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,519
sprawl

254
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,920
and

255
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,720
everything's silent it's complex

256
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,560
and if anyone's

257
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,560
heard of this pandemic

258
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,399
that we've been dealing with we're

259
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,680
seeing a huge shift in how we architect

260
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,000
our environments that are causing even

261
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,080
more complexity

262
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,240
so this is what we're facing from a

263
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,560
current state perspective when starting

264
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,360
to think about zero trust

265
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,240
now if this is what a customer's facing

266
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,760
what do you think the market pressures

267
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,240
are right now

268
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,640
do you think the market's helping or

269
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,120
hindering

270
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,760
hindering

271
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,279
so

272
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,440
we're seeing right now

273
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,760
probably two of my favorite and most

274
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,360
difficult shifts in the security

275
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,440
marketplace today

276
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,760
because of the pandemic

277
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,079
we are seeing a major shift towards

278
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,000
transformation

279
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
companies are not going back to offices

280
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,240
they're continuing to work from home

281
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,399
we are seeing a major shift towards

282
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,800
cloud adoption but you don't just put

283
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,600
everything poof into aws trust me that's

284
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,120
my husband's job right now for a

285
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,399
healthcare company

286
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,079
it just doesn't go overnight it's been

287
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,680
two years

288
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,680
so you're seeing hybrid

289
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,800
public private mix

290
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,680
you're seeing also which i think is most

291
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,880
interesting

292
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,040
the necessity for dynamic security

293
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,240
control

294
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,720
we can't have things be static anymore

295
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,680
so

296
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,120
we have companies that are trying to

297
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,480
deal with risk

298
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,399
everything's too slow it's not going

299
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,240
fast enough they can't see what they

300
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,360
have and you have two market trends one

301
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,880
all these static tools when you use to

302
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,880
feed them information and then spit out

303
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,800
a report they're all out the window

304
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,240
you've got to be able to see real time

305
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,000
what's happening

306
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,519
second thing

307
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,600
we're seeing a huge shift in how we look

308
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,760
at security it used to be event based

309
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,560
right a plus b equals c you'd see how

310
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,079
getting through the firewall you can see

311
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,440
what happened and would be a nice

312
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,920
correlation

313
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,440
it's now moved to relational base

314
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,720
security

315
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,720
i'm allowed to talk to paul but i'm not

316
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,320
allowed to talk to kate suddenly i'm

317
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,399
talking to kate what's the ramification

318
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,800
of that because kate could talk to

319
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,880
you have to understand the relationships

320
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,760
so in the face of this market change

321
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,279
we're seeing

322
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,440
this right here create a couple of

323
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,480
things

324
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,880
increase that profile

325
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,240
think about the attacks in the past year

326
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,399
application resilience

327
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,480
keeping your applications up

328
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,760
has become a critical imperative

329
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,959
multi-cloud adoption

330
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,720
it's a lot of fun isn't it

331
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,720
and business requirements for increased

332
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,639
velocity because

333
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,800
i'll give you an example a customer a

334
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,880
financial services customer they went

335
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,320
from 98

336
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,680
in office

337
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,279
to 98

338
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,639
work at home

339
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,200
in less than 48 hours

340
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,399
yeah

341
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,240
so how do you start to think about this

342
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,079
and this has set the scene for what are

343
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,920
we here to talk about today

344
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,959
these purpose access on steroids

345
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,079
so before we begin let's get a working

346
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,639
definition of zero trust

347
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,680
zero trust is not a solution

348
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,040
zero trust is a set of guiding

349
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,760
principles for workflow system design

350
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,120
and operation

351
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,079
it is not a solution a vendor

352
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,920
it is an architecture

353
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,760
oh this would be it is an architecture

354
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,399
sorry didn't realize that my slide was

355
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,560
wrong

356
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,079
the other thing is it's not a box

357
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,519
it's not going to be one product

358
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,320
at its core it separates the control

359
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,959
plane policy orchestration for policy

360
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,360
enforcement and according to nist you

361
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,760
should have two strategies user access

362
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,680
controls and application application

363
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,160
controls

364
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,200
sounds pretty simple right

365
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,600
things we've been doing for years

366
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
so what is causing

367
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,160
zero trust to be such a fixation

368
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,079
it seems pretty simple

369
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,519
never trust

370
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,040
always verify

371
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,839
default deny

372
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,839
the critical thing to remember is if

373
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,720
it's not a solution what is it

374
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,519
well it's a journey

375
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,720
and the journey to get to zero trust has

376
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,519
a couple critical things and again

377
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,680
on the surface they seem simple

378
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,839
one

379
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:16,399
discover

380
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,079
have you discovered everything in your

381
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,638
environment

382
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,480
when pulled 92 percent of csos and cios

383
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,000
admitted that they did not have

384
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,279
confidence that they knew where

385
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,240
everything was in their environments

386
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,360
key point

387
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,959
healthcare company i was talking to a

388
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,639
couple of months ago

389
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,160
they were in the middle of implementing

390
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,720
a zero trust strategy and they got a

391
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,079
call they were also moving a bunch of

392
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,600
stuff to aws

393
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,680
that they found a new environment they

394
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,720
mean he found a new environment

395
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,480
they had a test

396
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,240
environment

397
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,240
that nobody front would remember to turn

398
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,360
down

399
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,600
in china

400
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,760
that nobody had looked at or passed in

401
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,319
three years

402
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,079
discover

403
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,920
understanding everything in your

404
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,519
environment

405
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,440
next is visibility

406
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,760
this is my big passion visibility

407
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,079
because it's not a question of not only

408
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,480
understanding what you have

409
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,560
but do you know where it is and what

410
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,399
it's actually doing

411
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,839
and who has access to it

412
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,199
large bank

413
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,759
was working with on the east coast

414
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,440
we started looking at their zero trust

415
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,320
journey

416
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,519
and

417
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,120
when we ran the first scans on

418
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,480
visibility

419
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,560
it was

420
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,880
almost eye-opening that they didn't

421
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,320
realize they actually were looking at

422
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,000
the first scan of what was going on in

423
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,040
the network

424
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,839
and

425
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,480
the cio said there's a bug

426
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,040
but there's a bug there's no way that

427
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,639
date is leaving

428
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,160
that wouldn't happen

429
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,560
and we were physically watching

430
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,560
literally data being moved off the

431
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,079
environment there must be something

432
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,320
going on here that there's a bug in your

433
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,320
system picks up the phone makes three

434
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,399
calls we were watching in progress data

435
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,639
theft

436
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,639
he literally stopped the meeting it was

437
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,160
like i'll call you back we heard from a

438
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,519
month later after they finished the

439
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,160
forensics reports

440
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,639
do you understand what you have

441
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,199
can you see it and do you understand

442
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,720
what it's doing if it's too many things

443
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,120
it should be doing

444
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,000
next up dependency mapping

445
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,680
again

446
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,199
do you know what you have

447
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,639
can you see it do you know what you

448
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,240
should be doing what else is it

449
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,680
dependent on

450
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,279
i love telling stories if you don't

451
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,759
can't figure this one out

452
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,040
uh

453
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,680
and i'm really into financial services

454
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,560
so

455
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,920
bank

456
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,519
not going to tell where that somewhere

457
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,279
in the world

458
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,639
had a program called never down where in

459
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,040
the pandemic they decided that you had

460
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,360
to and the regulators were pushing this

461
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,359
you could not have your mobile banking

462
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,359
app because i get really grumpy if i

463
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,720
can't have access to my money i don't

464
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,000
know about you

465
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,520
mobile app could not be done more than

466
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,679
30 minutes 30 minutes later you're gonna

467
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:14,640
find

468
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,799
that sounds reasonable right

469
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,199
so when they looked at the application

470
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,799
they realized that they would never be

471
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,039
able to execute that sla

472
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,400
not because they didn't want to or it

473
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,480
was a critical system but that critical

474
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,120
application had dependencies on multiple

475
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,400
applications that had no sla

476
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,799
so how can you have a 30 minute sla over

477
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,720
here if it's dependent on things that

478
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,440
don't have the same like slas

479
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,720
do you understand your dependencies

480
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,480
now here's the one that gets most people

481
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,720
continuous assurance doesn't seem like

482
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,160
it'd be the worst one

483
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,400
but if you have a clean inventory do all

484
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,080
this stuff

485
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,640
is it one moment in time

486
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,400
or is it dynamically changing with your

487
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,760
environment i can't tell you having been

488
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,840
a season myself

489
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,080
how many times my peers go

490
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,880
oh

491
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,280
well i haven't played inventory queen is

492
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,520
it current or did it three weeks ago

493
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,440
great it's not current

494
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,720
because there's this thing called change

495
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,120
control

496
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,640
we're not static we're dynamic

497
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,799
so until we start understanding that

498
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,760
assurance equals dynamicism

499
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,520
you're never going to be able to execute

500
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,440
a zero trust journey

501
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,640
and last but not least policy

502
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,400
enforcement

503
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,520
do you have the buy-in to actually walk

504
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,799
the walk

505
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,320
and the right policies and what i mean

506
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,960
by that is no caveats no exceptions

507
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,600
zero trust

508
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,280
and i'll tell you that sometimes the

509
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,440
hardest one to overcome

510
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,400
is you have literally somebody in the

511
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,160
organization again

512
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,840
company i'm very close to healthcare

513
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,840
company

514
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,440
might have somebody who works there in

515
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,720
my family

516
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,799
literally was like hey i'm implementing

517
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,799
zero trust but you know what we did one

518
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,799
thing differently we have a special

519
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,720
group of users that have access to

520
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,000
everything that's not zero trust

521
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,480
it's not zero trust

522
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,760
so again

523
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,080
not just the policy enforcement from an

524
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,080
automation standpoint

525
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,720
but do you have the right enforcement

526
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,600
from a human capital standpoint

527
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,760
so once you actually realize what the

528
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,160
journey is how do you get started

529
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,280
and what are some of the things to

530
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,720
remember we've talked about some of them

531
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,400
but one

532
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,480
zero trust is an architecture not a

533
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,480
single product you can't say that enough

534
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,000
because every single one of my

535
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,320
counterparts is saying hey we're a zero

536
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,919
trust solution

537
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,520
do you know that can help you implement

538
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,160
zero trust i am so tired of that can i

539
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,640
tell you you know my company does warmer

540
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,280
we do two things we help prepare you

541
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,880
because we can help you with visibility

542
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,640
and we can help make sure that once

543
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,320
you've completed the journey that you

544
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,679
stay current

545
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,200
that's what we do

546
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,720
so if you ever hear me say that i can

547
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,640
help you on your zero trust solution

548
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,480
please shoot me because it's not true i

549
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,159
can hear the front and i can do the back

550
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,440
i'm not helping them that's not my job

551
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,880
second

552
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,799
we talked about this lack of support

553
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,200
you know that journey you just saw

554
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,559
that's something you can explain to a

555
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,320
border believement

556
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,640
we can't take this from a very techy

557
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,080
perspective

558
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,159
but everyone in the organization needs

559
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,039
to understand the sincerity around that

560
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,520
concept of trust no one

561
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,880
or you're going to end up trusting

562
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,760
everybody

563
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,440
remember is your trust baby who just

564
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,919
disappeared

565
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,960
third poor information equals poor

566
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,360
outcome not having accurate and current

567
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,880
information will do more harm than good

568
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,799
working with a company in canada it took

569
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,559
them six months to get an inventory

570
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,840
six months

571
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,080
get something out of your inventory cmd

572
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,960
rationalization

573
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,200
spreadsheets and interviews

574
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,880
one of the largest companies in the

575
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,480
world

576
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,080
and honestly that's

577
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,760
more times than not what we see

578
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,760
and the sad part is when they brought us

579
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,679
all the information i had to look a

580
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,520
counterpart away in the eyes and go it's

581
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,000
not current

582
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,640
poor information equals poor outcome

583
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,400
do you have dynamic control

584
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,720
again goes into it

585
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,120
dynamic inventory will counter almost

586
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,840
the complexity

587
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,000
and then the one that's my favorite

588
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,799
zero trust is a journey not a project it

589
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,640
has no end it is the never ending story

590
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,240
and the one thing that sometimes i think

591
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,960
hard for non-security professionals

592
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,080
is

593
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,159
you have to educate that you assume the

594
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,840
attackers are already in

595
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,159
that's hard

596
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,720
that there is no world that they're not

597
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,840
already in

598
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,799
what do you guys think somehow i'm glen

599
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,799
doom and we're all going to get zero

600
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,960
trust right

601
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,640
but here's the number one challenge we

602
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,000
see

603
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,640
it's this lack of visibility

604
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,559
and the reason i like to highlight this

605
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,799
is because poor visibility

606
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,640
inside the enterprise parameter make

607
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,480
zero trunks treacherous

608
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,480
here's why if you look at the user in

609
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,039
the rogue machine

610
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,440
in this hybrid world

611
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,039
you can assume

612
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,200
that if there's rogue machines if you

613
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,880
don't have visibility in what you're

614
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,039
supposed to be doing

615
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,640
you are going to continue to fail at

616
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,480
zero trust

617
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,880
visibility is by far

618
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,799
the number one thing you need when

619
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,720
looking at zero trust

620
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,640
do you understand

621
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,880
what is talking to what who is talking

622
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,919
to who

623
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,400
what is talking to who who is talking to

624
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,679
what

625
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,400
kind of complex right

626
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,559
and really what the applications and

627
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,799
workloads are doing so

628
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,039
if i have 20 applications how many

629
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,240
workloads do you think i have

630
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,679
any ideas

631
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,200
paul you're not allowed to say

632
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,039
on average 2000.

633
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,520
any idea how many relationships between

634
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,559
them and your dependencies

635
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,039
not that about

636
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,480
so think about that

637
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,840
most organizations have no clue

638
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,400
how intertwined from an invisibility

639
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,320
perspective they're facing when dealing

640
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,799
with zero trust

641
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,320
and without this visibility it's almost

642
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,960
impossible to keep a good zero trust

643
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,840
architecture going

644
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,320
so

645
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,360
let's go and flip the other side

646
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,240
how do we create success well

647
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,559
visibility visibility i can't say enough

648
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:11,679
visibility

649
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,039
but there's a couple other things one

650
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,600
you need to have a management system you

651
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,120
need to be able to have multiple

652
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,200
enforcement functions with the ability

653
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,880
to provide orchestration when it becomes

654
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,799
critical

655
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,799
good management on solid visibility is a

656
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,480
critical key

657
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,919
the second we've talked about it so

658
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,200
we're almost blue in the face is that

659
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,039
accurate inventory

660
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,039
do you have the ability and the

661
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,360
understanding of the entities within the

662
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,200
environment

663
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,279
and their dependencies

664
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,640
and are you able to really have a source

665
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,200
of truth for their relationships real

666
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,559
time in designing my fashion

667
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,840
and third thing is enforcement function

668
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,720
again

669
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,880
are you able to carry out the policies

670
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,400
without exception

671
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,039
necessary for cta

672
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,120
again why i break this down this way is

673
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,000
this is easy for the non-security layman

674
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
okay here's my journey and here's the

675
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,320
three things i need to implement

676
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,840
it's a lot easier to get buy-in on

677
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,679
something like this than showing a huge

678
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,760
diagram and trying to explain you know

679
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,720
what you're going to do on an

680
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,159
orchestrating segmentation program right

681
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,600
okay

682
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,080
these three things

683
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,440
once you have these three requirements

684
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,039
the next question it was interesting

685
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,480
because i'm actually doing another panel

686
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,159
about zero trust a couple weeks for

687
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,679
government conference

688
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,559
is how do you start so we have a journey

689
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,320
we have the critical money success

690
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,720
factors where do you start anyone an

691
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,400
idea of what kind of project you should

692
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,640
start with

693
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,799
other than visibility inventory once you

694
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,840
hear those

695
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,520
segmentation

696
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,559
gartner is my favorite gartner

697
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,760
recommends enterprises start with

698
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,240
a segmentation project organizations

699
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,760
looking to move to practical

700
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,919
implementation should focus on two

701
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,240
primary projects user application

702
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,320
segmentation and workload workload

703
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,039
segmentation

704
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,799
why would we do that

705
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,440
any ideas

706
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,120
because orchestrated segmentation allows

707
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,840
us

708
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,320
to create that invisi that visibility

709
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,159
that we were talking about and that

710
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,440
enforcement plan we were talking about

711
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,159
i like the concept of orchestrated

712
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,840
segmentation has anyone heard of

713
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,679
orchestrated segmentation

714
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,039
yeah a couple people

715
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,480
it's really simple

716
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,520
orchestrated segmentation is nothing but

717
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,000
compute intent based policies across

718
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,279
existing enforcement platforms

719
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,279
so creating the same policies the same

720
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,400
visibility across everything

721
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,720
so that you can orchestrate the same

722
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,799
experience

723
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,400
irregardless of your environment

724
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,720
make sense

725
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,559
i love everyone's like this

726
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,240
i agree with that i don't agree with

727
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,399
that yeah

728
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,000
so for my identity segmentation what

729
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,520
we're looking at here is how the user is

730
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,600
accessing multiple clouds so it's a

731
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,760
question of the visibility play and

732
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,440
whether or not like and this again is

733
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,679
more of a armor so the yammer solution

734
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:54,559
but

735
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,200
are you able to leverage

736
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,960
full visibility of what the user is

737
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,480
doing across all different of the

738
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,039
architectures and then enforce one

739
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,559
single policy across multiple

740
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,159
architectures irregardless if it's

741
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,440
public or private

742
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,799
so that's how you look from an any

743
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,360
perspective

744
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,039
one policy across multiple architectures

745
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,039
you guys agree with this everyone is

746
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,600
like uh-huh you know yes

747
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,600
okay

748
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,440
so

749
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,200
once you've done your segmentation

750
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,000
project then it's a question of where do

751
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,720
you go from there

752
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,440
what i like to look at is

753
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,760
what are some of the takeaways then

754
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,840
if you don't have to go through and once

755
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,399
you have segmentation in place

756
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,559
what are the key takeaways to continue

757
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,918
forward with the zero trust program

758
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,919
and this is where it's really tailored

759
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,080
dependent on your organization and your

760
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,279
needs

761
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,520
one

762
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,720
can you maintain consistent visibility

763
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,720
two

764
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,919
where do you need to go to create and

765
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,440
ensure distributed scaling architecture

766
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,720
three

767
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,320
this is a key one

768
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,840
avoiding policy duality

769
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,000
then once that's achieved

770
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,520
continuous policy assurance

771
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,279
this is one that we see a lot of

772
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,880
companies struggle with

773
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,520
leveraging existing technology how do

774
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,520
you sweat the assets you already have

775
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,879
instead of having to deploy you

776
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,919
and then also consistent taxonomy

777
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,080
do you understand

778
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,919
what the relationships are and the

779
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:57,840
assets in a common language

780
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,159
if you can then create after the

781
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,600
orchestrating segmentation or

782
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,320
segmentation project a plan around these

783
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,240
key takeaways

784
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,640
then you can actually push that journey

785
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,799
into the next level as far as a life

786
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,240
cycle management

787
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,039
versus a continually forward journey

788
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,600
and that's the key is how do you take it

789
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,520
and go from a straight line into

790
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,158
something that you can manage

791
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,720
yeah okay

792
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,320
you've got to start two things one it's

793
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,840
the asset discovery and understanding

794
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,039
everything you have

795
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,880
and then defining what you want from a

796
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,480
policy perspective

797
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,960
what do you have already deployed

798
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,520
and then how do you continue to ensure

799
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,559
that you have real-time control

800
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,000
exactly and the hard part is

801
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,919
the under so he's asking like how do you

802
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,360
put the the guardrails in place

803
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,200
and the critical thing is the guardrails

804
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,480
are easy understanding what your

805
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,480
policies are what you want to accomplish

806
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,480
is the easy part it's the question of

807
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,559
how do you continually enforce

808
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,880
to make sure that that's the outcome and

809
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,679
the

810
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,279
the other key thing when you're looking

811
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,799
from a policy perspective is the

812
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,960
enforcement is not all that hard either

813
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,880
it's making sure that you continue to

814
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,440
enforce the right things

815
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,440
exactly it's like exceptional avoidance

816
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,679
it's the classic issue i saw and maybe

817
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,679
five six years ago with scenes

818
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,840
you would have a sim and you would

819
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,760
have everything under the sun bed and do

820
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,840
it then you make an exception and then

821
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,440
you make an exception and then you'd

822
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,200
make an exception and then you would

823
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,960
fail an audit because you had too many

824
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,440
exceptions

825
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,320
yeah so how do you maintain to not make

826
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,320
exceptions

827
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,720
so

828
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,640
you have this pyramid

829
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,919
you have this concept of zero trust

830
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,240
the interesting thing is

831
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,960
it's really hard

832
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,640
so talked with the ciso from the

833
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,399
government this morning as we're

834
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,720
prepping for a panel he was saying we

835
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,240
started the journey

836
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,799
and i don't know what to do next

837
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,039
we do all of those things those five

838
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,559
things we were showing

839
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,880
and i can't sort out

840
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,760
what i should be doing next first

841
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,600
because i feel like we do it all we just

842
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,159
haven't put it all together

843
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,279
and we're seeing that across every

844
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,960
enterprise that everyone's kind of

845
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,120
raising their hand and going we get the

846
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,679
triangle we get the journey but we don't

847
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,919
understand how we put a reference

848
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,279
architecture

849
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,919
a policy control framework

850
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,840
and everything else we should in one

851
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,120
and

852
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,519
i think that's why you're seeing such a

853
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,279
huge rise in the industry of so many

854
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,120
companies going i can do this i can do

855
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,960
this i can do this

856
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,320
what do you think the government's done

857
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,399
in response

858
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,519
800 series

859
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,200
so you are exactly right um i was joking

860
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,360
this morning that i have 127 pages of

861
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,640
reading from my friends at the white

862
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,960
house this week on xero trust

863
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,559
but it's the first time i've seen the

864
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,760
government actually this week welcoming

865
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,799
public feedback

866
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,120
the white house and sissa

867
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,840
and actually won't be released this week

868
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,640
three different documents so the federal

869
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,960
trust federal zero trust strategy doc

870
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,200
the system maturity model and the cloud

871
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,480
security technical reference

872
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,919
architecture

873
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,559
and they've openly called for the public

874
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,159
to respond with

875
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,960
comments and questions for the last two

876
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,360
this is air trust and the cloud security

877
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,279
technical reference architecture they're

878
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,840
taking comments and questions on it

879
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,679
until october 1st

880
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,080
on the federal strategy september 21st

881
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,000
if the government is asking for feedback

882
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,239
on how to make this better

883
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,399
this is tough

884
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,760
but i thought this was really

885
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,320
interesting that and literally the three

886
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,639
documents together 127 pages

887
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,918
but i think it's a great step forward

888
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,879
in public and private collaboration

889
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,719
as we look to

890
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,839
really approach this not as a solution

891
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,320
not as a product

892
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,320
but as a journey and something that we

893
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,239
all have to contribute to

894
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,399
if we're going to continue to

895
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,560
mitigate the new types of attacks that

896
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,719
we're facing

897
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,598
and if we do all of that

898
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,918
maybe we'll sleep like a baby

899
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,920
we have zero trust baby again any

900
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,920
questions

901
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,640
saw a lot of people taking pictures so i

902
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,759
guess my slides were okay

903
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,200
any questions about zero trust

904
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,720
any questions about zero trust baby

905
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,640
was this helpful guys

906
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,359
good

907
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:22,720
good good

908
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,680
yeah

909
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,680
um

910
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,000
why don't we take that offline because

911
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,359
that's a longer conversation in two

912
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,480
minutes we'll take that offline

913
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,920
any other questions

914
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,520
so the question is what do you do when

915
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,280
you have an organization that wants

916
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,839
exceptions

917
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,599
and they just don't understand that

918
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,000
that's not zero trust so a couple of

919
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,280
things um

920
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,599
we run into that more often than not

921
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,680
um working right now with one of the

922
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,520
largest telcos in the world

923
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,160
and this has been an ongoing battle

924
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,760
because you have sabotaged groups and so

925
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,280
you know this group wants you to trust

926
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,640
this group doesn't this group calls this

927
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,160
sister what's up those coupons the other

928
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:36,880
thing

929
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,040
this is how we handle that

930
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,960
zero trust is not an all or nothing

931
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,400
thing okay

932
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,320
you can execute zero trust if you have a

933
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,920
large organization

934
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,040
on a specific area of your environment

935
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,320
right

936
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,240
maybe it's your crime jewels maybe it's

937
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,560
the critical apps but you don't have to

938
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,720
have it be everywhere

939
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,960
you just have to have unequivocal buy-in

940
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,400
to the area you're going to implement it

941
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,640
so a lot of times part of that

942
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,880
dependency mapping you saw and that

943
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,119
visibility discovery area part of the

944
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,200
discovery phase is working with an

945
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,760
organization to say where is it critical

946
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,119
that you implement zero trust right now

947
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,520
what does that look like

948
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,640
and then

949
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,680
as adoption and culture changes that

950
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,680
it's not this visceral reaction of trust

951
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,640
no one

952
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,400
you know and that that's okay it's okay

953
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,000
to trust someone from an environmental

954
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,040
standpoint

955
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,880
then you'll see in essence scope

956
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,119
preparing the other direction where it

957
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,440
becomes easier to adopt zero trust in

958
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,000
other areas of the organization

959
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,720
yeah i mean it's it's hard

960
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,200
there's just a visceral reaction to for

961
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,359
some and a lot of times and i'm one of

962
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,079
them so i can say it will network box

963
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,480
the idea that you're gonna take away my

964
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,119
controls on everything it's a hard

965
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,079
battle

966
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,480
so fight the battle where you need it

967
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,480
where it's really important

968
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,640
and get the cultural buy-in and then you

969
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,079
can kind of laterally move through

970
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,560
organization to get a larger footprint

971
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,359
from the zero trust perspective

972
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:10,800
the one thing to remember though and

973
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,160
this was something i learned it was a

974
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,839
hard lesson to learn is when you're

975
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,370
talking about critical assets

976
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:16,880
[Music]

977
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,040
80 percent of companies

978
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,040
have misidentified what they consider

979
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,280
their crown jewels

980
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,760
so really work with your uh perfect

981
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,520
example worked with a large

982
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,280
manufacturing company

983
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,920
in the midwest and they came to me and

984
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,800
they said

985
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,720
when we implement this strategy you need

986
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,720
to remember that our recipes are our

987
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,640
crown jewels

988
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,320
whatever you do

989
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,920
protect our recipes oh they're a

990
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,520
consumer packaging good manufacturing

991
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,040
company that makes sense right it's

992
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,000
recipes we did the analysis 2000

993
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,599
employees a day had access to those

994
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,320
recipes they were unprotectable

995
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,000
they were spending 10 million dollars a

996
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
year protecting something that was not

997
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,240
able to be protected

998
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,320
what were their crown jewels their m a

999
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,839
activity and their future marketing

1000
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,599
stuff of where they were headed next in

1001
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:04,800
the market

1002
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,000
guess how much they were spending on

1003
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,400
protecting that stuff

1004
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,000
zero

1005
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,720
so

1006
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,200
when you start the zero drone's journey

1007
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,760
you think about your critical assets

1008
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,680
as security professionals that's one of

1009
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,599
the best things we can do

1010
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,520
is go to the board go to your leadership

1011
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,040
and say we really should analyze

1012
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,440
what is the critical data of the company

1013
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,680
do we really understand what our crown

1014
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,400
drills are and run that tabletop before

1015
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,400
you invest one dollar in how you're

1016
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,480
going to execute the security piece of

1017
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,359
it

1018
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,079
again it's that cultural piece that we

1019
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,359
kind of forget about sometimes as

1020
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,480
security professionals

1021
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,640
everyone's like food coma

1022
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,920
any other questions

1023
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,040
