uh i actually have a new title uh in

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,960
that branch that's formerly on the

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,399
advisory board now i'm actually a

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,239
full-time employee

23
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,000
as a principal threat hunter for the

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,960
company i do have my own uh boutique or

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,199
intelligence firm bamak consulting where

26
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,199
i sell grip feeds

27
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,840
i also recently went back to get my

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,640
master's in cyber security and now

29
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,559
finishing my phd in machine learning and

30
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,559
cyber security machine learning a couple

31
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,479
of aspects i'll talk about in this talk

32
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,240
but

33
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,920
you know because i like the abuse i

34
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,799
decided to do a thesis and i've led

35
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,600
several large frontal sharing groups

36
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,240
investigating march large scale threats

37
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,920
i've been working in this industry for

38
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,520
22 years

39
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,320
so

40
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,360
you know i have the scars to prove it

41
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,400
so as

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,240
oh meaning the wrong button

43
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,079
there we go

44
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,560
obviously if you didn't get a sense of

45
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,920
where i was going from the title of this

46
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,799
talk

47
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,680
you know

48
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,079
we have unlimited job security because

49
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,920
there's significant flaws in pretty much

50
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,159
every aspect of our tech stack and we're

51
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,040
adopting this stack into new functions

52
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,200
all the time that only increase

53
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,560
the scope and severity of the kind of

54
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,880
problems that we can face

55
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,640
and because i'm irish you know by nature

56
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,280
i find humor in existential dread

57
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,000
so i find this uh funny

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,199
but the less mummified version is

59
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,680
fundamentally cyber security is not a

60
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,200
technology problem

61
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,360
it is a human it's a human nature

62
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,120
problem

63
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,599
and we've been killing thieving since

64
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,760
the beginning of time right

65
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,840
the bible as purely historical

66
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,440
literature not

67
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,760
talking theology at this point you know

68
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,400
the second generation was kane killing

69
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,440
abel right and i have six kids for whom

70
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,760
four of whom are boys and can see

71
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,319
firsthand the fratricidal nature of

72
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,080
mankind is still present in this

73
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,920
generation

74
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,239
what the internet has changed is really

75
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,120
the scale and scope of the problem

76
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,959
we've had check fraud and various forms

77
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,239
of financial fraud forever right

78
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,040
now

79
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,120
people in russia can engage in credit

80
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,879
card fraud against victims in the united

81
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,200
states without physically exposing

82
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,319
themselves

83
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,239
we can do bank robberies without people

84
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,000
walking into a bank with guns which has

85
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,480
lots of risks

86
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,200
you do it over greater distances

87
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,599
what's important there is jurisdiction

88
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,599
issues right i spend a lot of my time

89
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,840
investigating cyber crime that never

90
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,159
really much comes of it because we can't

91
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,599
arrest anybody

92
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,280
you know the the criminals may be

93
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,959
breaking laws in the united states but

94
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,360
if they live in nigeria or russia or

95
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,879
china

96
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,120
occasionally we've had winds

97
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,959
most of the time we don't

98
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,799
all of the current ransomware gangs are

99
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,959
operated by people who know better

100
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,680
uh than to go someplace where the united

101
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,280
states can touch them or anywhere in the

102
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,959
western world

103
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,480
you know occasionally we get some

104
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,000
affiliates or some ancillary groups

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,440
sometimes somebody makes a stupid

106
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,720
decision

107
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,440
but

108
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,760
crime does pay on the internet as long

109
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,040
as you're smart enough to pick your

110
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,439
victims

111
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,239
and the greatest trend right is even

112
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,640
though we can't address any of the above

113
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,159
we are adopting technology that

114
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,400
continues to increase risk

115
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,319
you know in the 90s we didn't say cyber

116
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,159
security we said information security

117
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,920
right because really what we're dealing

118
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,920
with was information misuses of

119
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,120
information

120
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,959
fraud

121
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,959
uh technology is creating the work

122
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,358
creating a world where we can get people

123
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,840
killed using technology uh and it's been

124
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,600
used to facilitate that we'll talk about

125
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,120
a

126
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,840
of that in couple of

127
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,240
of couple of slides

128
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,680
but the bottom line is the stuff that

129
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,600
we've done or technology we've done 10

130
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,240
years ago still isn't safe right and i

131
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,720
mean proper definition of safe

132
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,720
um we can't really make it safe

133
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,560
right email is a great example right

134
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,400
everybody uses email

135
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,960
uh to do all sorts of things right you

136
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,840
know

137
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,360
a lot of people are buying and selling

138
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,800
houses right now because of the housing

139
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,720
market you want to get a mortgage you

140
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,560
got to send tax returns right i've gone

141
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,560
through this process twice yelling at

142
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,320
bankers saying oh just email me your tax

143
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,000
return

144
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,039
no

145
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,560
you know i'm not going to email your tax

146
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,759
return oh here's the routing and account

147
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,080
number to do wiring transfers to closing

148
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,479
don't email that to me pick up the phone

149
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,520
it's a hundred thousand dollar

150
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,840
transaction that warrants a 30-second

151
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,240
phone call a 20 transaction okay we can

152
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,560
do that over email right but for most

153
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,440
people

154
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,120
buying and selling a house is the most

155
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,440
expensive uh transaction they will

156
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,039
engage in

157
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,560
you know unless they've gone breaking

158
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,080
bad or selling that

159
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,720
so but we do this over email

160
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,520
something was made in 1979 and 1980 the

161
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,600
protocol you kind of stapled security on

162
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,520
it but those of us who've done this for

163
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,039
a while realize that if you don't make

164
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,520
something secure and architect something

165
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,199
secure to begin with

166
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,880
you really can't make it secure in the

167
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,680
end

168
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,800
you know the process to create mainframe

169
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,960
technology make that secure in the 60s

170
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,120
was immense and then we went to client

171
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,280
server and web app so no one went

172
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,280
through that same process a second time

173
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,360
it's expensive it's time consuming and

174
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,720
ain't nobody want to spend money on it

175
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,000
so here we are

176
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,520
bad news is

177
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,880
all these fundamental problems still

178
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,800
exist good news is unlimited job

179
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,720
security right

180
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,919
you know

181
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,840
i'm in my 40s right and i'm about 10

182
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,759
years away from that age when men start

183
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,360
becoming unemployable because no one

184
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,120
wants to pay us what we're worth

185
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,800
that's not a problem in cyber security

186
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,080
there's just too much work to do

187
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,639
everybody probably has this how many

188
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,080
people have webcam cameras on their

189
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,759
laptops

190
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,720
right

191
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,039
i can think of no bigger physical

192
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,240
manifestation of our complete failure as

193
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,000
an industry to solve simple problems

194
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,160
because i was 10 years ago director of

195
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,800
the fbi james comey now famous for other

196
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,720
reasons but let's get past that

197
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,280
it was on cnn for something and says how

198
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,360
do you secure your laptop right so i put

199
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,759
a little webcam camera over this

200
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,759
you are the director of one of the

201
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,240
largest and well fun most well-funded

202
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,599
intelligence agencies and law

203
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,319
enforcement agencies in the world

204
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,319
and we our tax dollars cannot prevent

205
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,919
this man from being spied onto his

206
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,720
webcam so we put plastic in front of it

207
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,960
this is our solution to problems right

208
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,599
uh as we can't solve them um and that's

209
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,960
okay

210
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,639
now that's an amusing anecdote right

211
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,919
with webcams right but now we have in

212
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,240
essence webcams on our cell phones you

213
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,919
know we've adopted the same technology

214
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,720
just put it in a mobile platform

215
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,840
you know

216
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,240
the threat landscape here right is

217
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,880
really we're talking about men creeping

218
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,400
on younger women and hopefully finding

219
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
them in a state of undress

220
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,479
the same style technology gets put in

221
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,000
cell phones

222
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,759
here's your threat landscape

223
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,440
you know i'm going to imagine some of

224
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,520
you may know the person on the left uh

225
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,879
for those of you who don't he's a

226
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,120
journalist for the washington post jamal

227
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,560
khashoggi

228
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,520
uh

229
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,520
malware was put on his phone to help

230
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,800
facilitate

231
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,400
lure him into an embassy where he was

232
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
not exactly

233
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,280
humanely killed

234
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,160
his mobile device helped facilitate that

235
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,360
some of the same stuff we're talking

236
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,319
about

237
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,639
on the right is weaker muslims for those

238
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,879
of you pay attention to that human

239
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,879
rights tragedy and genocide have

240
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,759
remained honest to weaker muslims and

241
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,599
inside mainland china

242
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,039
there is a lot of surveillance the

243
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,280
chinese government does targeted these

244
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,680
individuals and their phones to find out

245
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,680
not just about their targets but who

246
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,599
their targets are talking to so that

247
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,440
they can add more targets to put them in

248
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,599
concentration camps

249
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,599
this is the wild world we're creating

250
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,599
with the technology when we take

251
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,919
existing things and just put it into a

252
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,320
new platform thinking hey there's neat

253
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,240
stuff i can do with this

254
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,760
it's good stuff i can do with my cell

255
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,120
phone i can see

256
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,800
i'm three hours away from my oldest son

257
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,519
in high school i can real time notice of

258
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,399
when he misses homework assignments 20

259
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,680
years ago

260
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,760
20 years ago 25 years ago when i was in

261
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,839
high school my parents had to nag me or

262
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,360
call my teachers to figure out what was

263
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,440
due and what wasn't and their first

264
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,279
insight was a report card

265
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,000
right now now i'm on my son within you

266
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
know hours notice i probably couldn't be

267
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,920
here today i'm a single parent of that

268
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,760
child right i wouldn't be able to be

269
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,040
three hours away if it weren't for a

270
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,080
cell phone some of the apps we have

271
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,920
but there's downsides too

272
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,600
i suppose for those of you who are still

273
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,880
students there's downsides to your

274
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,320
parents having that kind of visibility

275
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,440
into your studies also

276
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,880
but high level trends in the threat

277
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,240
landscape right

278
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,839
there's lots of efficient mount doc

279
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,080
malicious documents you know for initial

280
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,480
foothold it's easy

281
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,959
to get people to click on something

282
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,480
relatively speaking i'll show you a

283
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,200
couple examples but one of my favorite

284
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,600
fishing exercise for a pen test of a

285
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,440
client type or uh yeah a client i work

286
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,720
for

287
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,399
was sent to all of the developers

288
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,680
there's like eight ten thousand

289
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,080
developers in this company

290
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,399
sent them an excel spreadsheet the lure

291
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,560
was hey facebook's building a data

292
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,399
center in this town look at this

293
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,399
spreadsheet which will let you know what

294
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,480
your salary range could be

295
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,160
and i mean you had to go and really

296
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,800
spend effort like enable macros do this

297
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,760
this

298
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,000
they made it so it wasn't easy to open

299
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,240
the file and that was just peeking out

300
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,839
and they found out some some absurd

301
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,839
percent it's like 80 90 of people

302
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,480
actually went through all the sets

303
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,000
you know and they were like oh this is

304
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,200
horrible we need to do security

305
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,360
awareness training no that's not your

306
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,760
risk i mean that is a risk but it's not

307
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,040
the risk

308
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,200
the risk is that 80 or 90 of your

309
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
developers are so anxious to get out of

310
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,079
a company as technologists who are

311
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,519
irritated when they can't get the

312
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,360
information they want quickly still

313
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,519
button match to figure out how fast they

314
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,880
can run out the door that is a more

315
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,399
profound problem than a security problem

316
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,640
um attackers live off the land right we

317
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,120
think of hacking as malware based now

318
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,720
we're still a role

319
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,959
but a lot of the tools we use to manage

320
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,279
our own environment the attackers get

321
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,440
access to and then manage

322
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,600
our environment for their game

323
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
you know why create tools that can be

324
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,839
attributed or might get caught by

325
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,160
antivirus or endpoint tools when i can

326
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,440
simply use

327
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,200
uh solarwinds

328
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,760
to relive a story from how the russians

329
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,160
canceled christmas last year

330
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,519
uh supply chain is a big thing right if

331
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,279
i can attack one target and get a

332
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,720
thousand victims

333
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,640
that's pretty darn efficient

334
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,040
both cyber cyber criminals and nation

335
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,880
states are highly economic actors in the

336
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,120
sense of they want to maximize their

337
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,880
return on investment

338
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,800
they do the same kind of calculations

339
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,600
that we do justifying business expenses

340
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,000
right and they know that hey if i kick

341
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,240
over solar winds i get lots of stuff or

342
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,240
code cove there's a lot of interesting

343
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,839
attack not a lot there's two major

344
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:48,079
breaches of azure

345
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,600
and one zero data was announced

346
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,360
yesterday right

347
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,959
why bother going into one target

348
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,360
environment or if i can go where a lot

349
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,240
of industry has their cloud resources

350
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,320
it's a lot simpler

351
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,480
right and there's too many attack or too

352
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,639
many resources for attackers to use of

353
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,600
compromised accounts and infrastructure

354
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,560
they're at no want for starting points

355
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,920
and footholds in their attacks

356
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,959
so to start you know talking about

357
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,279
malicious documents this is a zero day

358
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,720
that was

359
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,720
announced tuesday maybe or maybe it's

360
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,200
friday relatively recent

361
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,360
um

362
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,959
my contact information is at the end of

363
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,720
the slide i'll have to email you the

364
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,079
slide to save the effort of taking

365
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,600
pictures

366
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,399
yeah just yeah

367
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,920
um this tv basically you know in an

368
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,519
office document can create a malicious

369
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,240
activex control that bypasses the

370
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,920
enabled list enables all the pop-up

371
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,360
dialogues to do remote code execution

372
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,120
right as seen in targeted attacks which

373
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,680
is always a nice euphemism for spy

374
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,240
agencies doing bad things right

375
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,959
presumably eastern and western targets

376
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:01,839
and

377
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,680
we'll probably see

378
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,200
i'm actually i'm sure it's probably

379
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,399
hitting target environments for

380
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,560
commodity attacks now because whenever a

381
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,279
patch comes out it's usually 24 to 48

382
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,800
hours tops before it's reverse

383
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,560
engineered and then everybody in the

384
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,079
world starts using it for a couple of

385
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:16,959
weeks

386
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,639
to get everybody who's struggling to do

387
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,399
patches

388
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,200
the reality is as this technique has

389
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,959
been around for a while this just saves

390
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,959
a couple of steps for attackers

391
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,320
um

392
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,560
but you know like i said it's the

393
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,720
inclusion of scripting languages in

394
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,000
office files while useful for certain

395
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,279
applications

396
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,440
also creates tremendous risk

397
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,120
but if you think about it

398
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,880
office has existed

399
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,480
since the 90s

400
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,160
i don't know i i don't know exactly when

401
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,920
office was created my first introduction

402
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,959
was in the air force in 95 because how

403
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,360
they train military officers is teach

404
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,519
them how to do powerpoint presentations

405
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,040
because that's how we fight wars these

406
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,839
days is with powerpoint slides um i'm

407
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,320
sarcastic but only a little bit but it's

408
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,959
been around for 20 at least 26 years

409
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,720
right give or take

410
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,920
still haven't figured out a way to use

411
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,240
it safely right in terms of conveying

412
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,920
information between organizations

413
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,360
my first explosion of malicious

414
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,440
documents was in uh

415
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,760
2005 give or take

416
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,920
the chinese do fantastic work with

417
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,160
malicious documents by the way right

418
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,079
i am obviously not a fan of their

419
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,000
government to their policies but the

420
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,320
expertise they do in this technique is

421
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,519
just amazing

422
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,240
and

423
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,720
adobe included javascript functionality

424
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,120
early on in pdf readers and they were

425
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,040
using this to compromise you know

426
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,519
found long and tibetans

427
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,880
in canada

428
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,760
you know

429
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,519
it was great work right you know they've

430
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,199
been doing it forever

431
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,839
um but ultimately right it's javascript

432
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,040
activex macros you name it we're putting

433
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,720
scripting functionality into office

434
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,959
documents which means i can send a

435
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,320
document to go do something in the

436
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,199
target environment our solution for this

437
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,600
is pop-up dialogues and as i mentioned

438
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,279
from my earlier an anecdote if you got

439
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,279
the right enough lure people will button

440
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,440
match through all those dialogues

441
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,880
right you know there's a lot of

442
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,399
businesses and industries right now

443
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,160
we're cash draft you send them something

444
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,560
that says po somebody might button match

445
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,399
all the way through that because appeal

446
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,959
means somebody wants to pay you send

447
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,880
them an invoice so they can pay you

448
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,079
right so it's a great lure one of my

449
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,720
favorite lures was this one you probably

450
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,639
can't see it clearly in the back right

451
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,880
but it's just an email that reported to

452
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,720
be a subpoena

453
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,199
you know united states district court

454
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,880
you know you're commanded to appear

455
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,199
before a grand jury you can see little

456
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,800
bits and pieces if you're a little bit

457
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,959
savvy about how this is

458
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,959
not somebody with a proper understanding

459
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,040
of the court right grand juries don't

460
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,040
take place in civil court

461
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,759
you know i think below this it talks

462
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,880
about a local prosecutor uh in federal

463
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,959
court right it's not a u.s attorney

464
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,959
there's a couple of instances of british

465
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,399
english versus

466
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,600
proper american war-winning english

467
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,800
right

468
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,360
but this was sent just to ceos west of

469
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,720
the mississippi this particular one

470
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,600
about 1400 ceos and major companies

471
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,240
99 click rate

472
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,000
right a good fishing campaign for a

473
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,680
criminal's perspective is like five

474
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,160
percent they're happy with one percent

475
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,000
because email is cheap right email two

476
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,160
million people who cares right uh if you

477
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,440
got to be a little bit more discreet

478
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,759
you've got time to kill right

479
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,920
this actually had u.s attorneys clicking

480
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,399
on it because well major ceos of

481
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,079
companies also tend to know u.s

482
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,920
attorneys and can pick up the phone and

483
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,120
be like what the hell are you talking

484
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,399
about you're making me appear in front

485
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,399
of a grand jury and they're like i don't

486
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:45,600
know what you're talking about send me

487
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,440
this and they'd click on it got people

488
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,839
in the justice department is fantastic

489
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,920
and all this this campaign did

490
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,240
was steal address books and encryption

491
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,560
keys

492
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,320
right

493
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,639
just a very targeted specific

494
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,040
smash and grab of some pretty sensitive

495
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,679
stuff and i'm like i said for tradecraft

496
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,119
of espionage

497
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,799
you know i want to map the entire

498
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,280
american economy how should i do that

499
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,799
why not just steal the address book

500
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,160
because every time you email somebody it

501
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,919
usually puts an entry in there that

502
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,439
there's public or private keys you can

503
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,039
see who really matters

504
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,799
now i've mapped relationships of an

505
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,599
entire economy with one low rent fishing

506
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,039
campaign

507
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,720
right think of how many people in meat

508
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,520
space that would take to accomplish that

509
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,039
you know because that's usually how

510
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,640
intelligence scales since you throw

511
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,000
people at a problem

512
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,600
in fact that's how china solves most of

513
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,200
their problems they put people at it but

514
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,720
they still use technology in great ways

515
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,720
to continue the point about email right

516
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,039
business email compromise is a thing

517
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,799
usually involves compromising an email

518
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,400
account forwarding information right

519
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,720
we're in a glut of home sales or

520
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,799
refinancing because of the housing

521
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,160
market

522
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,880
so

523
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,720
they simply compromise

524
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,200
title attorneys or title companies look

525
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,960
for transactions and then just send an

526
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,039
update oh by the way no no here's here's

527
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,360
the escrow account send the money here

528
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,960
and it's dollar amounts for the bank

529
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,640
don't eat it right

530
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,160
somebody steals your debit card and

531
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,440
steals 200

532
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,280
your bank's going to eat that somebody

533
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,280
steals 200 000

534
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,880
you could be just another person that is

535
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,960
your retirement and sorry the bank ain't

536
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
going to eat it hopefully somebody

537
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,799
somewhere in the chain has an insurance

538
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,320
policy

539
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,280
um romance scams right

540
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,400
you know particularly during the

541
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,000
pandemic in places that are more locked

542
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,280
down right

543
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,520
the human need for romantic connection

544
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,880
has not debated because of the virus

545
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,120
you know i guess like doing zoom dating

546
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,240
is a thing now you know well the problem

547
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,320
fundamental problem with dating online

548
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,880
is you know there's a comment in the 90s

549
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,160
you don't know that the person on the

550
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,880
other side of the keyboard isn't a dog

551
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,400
we haven't solved that problem since the

552
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,760
90s and now

553
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,280
i mean we could update it you don't know

554
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,720
the person on the other side of the

555
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,720
keyboard is a nigerian

556
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,640
and they did fantastic work in romance

557
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,320
and i'm fun mentally evil don't get me

558
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,320
wrong i'm not justifying it but they do

559
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,919
great work of just convincing people

560
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,000
they're really in love and it's a thing

561
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,520
and you're sending five thousand dollars

562
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,880
so i can fly over there we'll get

563
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,640
married whatever and then all of a

564
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,960
sudden and you can't you can't convince

565
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,120
these victims that they're being scammed

566
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,640
you can tell them

567
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,559
but it's their money in this country

568
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,240
right you know we can't tell people not

569
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,520
to buy our money so you know it was like

570
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,799
this is not real

571
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,039
they think it is

572
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,360
you know that's a problem we can't solve

573
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,880
right and if the problem is like this

574
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,760
isn't this isn't even a sock problem

575
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,880
usually

576
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,039
isn't to solve problem

577
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,840
right unless the victim happens to be in

578
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,039
a high ranking person in your

579
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,000
organization or an elected official

580
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,919
or some other government leader head of

581
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,640
an agency all cases that i've seen where

582
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,080
instead of trying to get a couple grand

583
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,400
of extortion money they're saying oh by

584
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,280
the way

585
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,960
you know you sent some pictures and you

586
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,799
did some video chats and that would

587
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,880
probably be untoward if it got out uh

588
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,480
i'd like access to your stuff right um

589
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,159
i can't sell you a tool to fix that

590
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,799
problem right extortion's the extortion

591
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,240
sucks when you're on the business end of

592
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,000
it

593
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,919
we all know what ransomware is

594
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,400
right it's been around since 2007 when

595
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,640
or not 2007. i made that mistake twice

596
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,960
this week 2013

597
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,640
because eventually cyber criminals

598
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,840
figured out how to do encryption

599
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,880
correctly

600
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,240
which is actually a very hard thing to

601
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,039
do

602
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,400
the problem with encryption isn't the

603
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,559
map the problem is the implementation

604
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,640
right that's what always

605
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,640
you know sticks it to you

606
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,480
criminals figured it out they had

607
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,159
bitcoin and cryptocurrency that made

608
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,159
moving money easy across national

609
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,960
boundaries and is sanctions resistant so

610
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,440
now they kick over entire organizations

611
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,320
you know hospitals get this you know

612
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,480
hospitals have some pretty strong needs

613
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,240
to stay completely operational all the

614
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,600
time

615
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,360
but ultimately it's a big math problem

616
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,039
there's a huge ecosystem of people

617
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,559
behind it

618
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,880
they can operate with near impunity

619
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,080
occasionally we announce indictments

620
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,440
but they're public indictments and

621
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,080
somebody in st petersburg is like oh

622
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,760
i guess the united states has indicted

623
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,720
me

624
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,360
better not go to spain for vacation

625
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,400
you know

626
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,400
but you know if you're a billionaire or

627
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,679
multi-millionaire in russia you can

628
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,679
still live a pretty comfortable life if

629
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,080
you don't mind the fact that the sun

630
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,600
never sets part of the year and the sun

631
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,880
never comes up the other part of the

632
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,039
year

633
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,120
but they also operate in a similar way

634
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,200
they get the initial foothold and it's

635
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,960
not just malware binaries right they're

636
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,640
using their own tools to kick over an

637
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,280
entire organization right 2013 to 2016

638
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,559
give or take

639
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,200
right ransomware was hey you click on a

640
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,520
mail doc and all of a sudden your your

641
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,520
machine's infected you pay 300 to a

642
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
thousand dollars give or take right it

643
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,600
could go for individual machines that's

644
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,440
more or less going away

645
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,280
now it's we want to kick over entire

646
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,360
organizations which means there's an

647
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,720
operator at the end of the keyboard

648
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,039
who's directing the attack and making

649
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,440
decisions of how best to do that and

650
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,600
tailor what they're doing so that when

651
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,919
they take you over right you don't have

652
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,240
an easy means of recovery

653
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,640
something happened two weeks ago

654
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,679
is a victim got ransomware they're in

655
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,760
the recovery process they preemptively

656
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,919
notified their partners and victims hey

657
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,320
we got this because ransomware also

658
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,480
tends to leak information so let's give

659
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,600
advanced notice to the victims hey

660
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,120
maybe protect yourself because this is

661
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,559
common

662
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,039
so instead of having the 72 or five day

663
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,280
deadline to pay uh before they leave the

664
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,120
documents the ransomware operator said

665
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,640
no you know you weren't a good victim we

666
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,640
leaked them anyway

667
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,320
but the sheer amount of information

668
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,799
that's leaked we call it dark web but

669
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,280
it's not really really dark web of just

670
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,440
repositories of information stolen from

671
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,280
organizations that can be weaponized as

672
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,679
immense

673
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,120
but at its core ransomware is really

674
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,200
a business continuity problem something

675
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,600
talked about in the cissp

676
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,080
right which generally is technical

677
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,440
practitioners who can land that's the

678
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,080
issp that's like security for dummies

679
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,520
and management

680
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,799
but really the one thing they have it

681
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,679
right about cissp is risk

682
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,919
but business continuity right data

683
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,320
centers don't burn to the ground

684
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,559
well ovh had that problem last year but

685
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:21,840
let's get past that

686
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,919
that's that's an exception right we're

687
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,520
even pretty good about natural disasters

688
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,840
we had a major one in louisiana as far

689
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,320
as i could tell nothing really went down

690
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,919
and their data centers operated in new

691
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,400
orleans they stayed operational for the

692
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,480
most part in katrina 10 years prior they

693
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,000
stayed operational

694
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,760
you know we're pretty good at that the

695
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,679
business interruption problem we have is

696
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,520
ransomware

697
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,760
which is really i mean yeah you want to

698
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,279
prevent it getting a new organization

699
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,360
we'll talk about that but it comes down

700
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,840
to can your backups restore information

701
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,600
quickly or can you restore operations

702
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,880
quickly

703
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,480
um you know backups hasn't evolved much

704
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,200
in 20 years i mean fundamentally it's

705
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,600
all on the same platform of tapes

706
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,039
you know you could do things in the

707
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,200
cloud but actually cloud costs where it

708
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,520
kills you isn't storage

709
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,679
you know that's expensive in the cloud

710
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,640
everything else is pretty cheap

711
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,320
but many organizations have never really

712
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,960
tested a recovery plan you know oh we

713
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,640
have backups and all the lights turned

714
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,640
green i run into this several times in

715
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,799
20 years nobody pays attention to their

716
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,120
backups as long as there's not a pre

717
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,679
proactive alert how many people want to

718
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,000
be abdominal of the students here want

719
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,240
to be a backup guy

720
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,320
now you all want to be pet testers

721
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,760
all right you know everybody wants to do

722
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,159
something else there's nothing more

723
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,320
boring in the world than backups

724
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,840
until you need it

725
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,320
it's like car insurance

726
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,919
you know nobody cares about car

727
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,200
insurance unless they have to pay the

728
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,320
bill they want the cheapest bill

729
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,440
possible until you have to file a claim

730
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,200
right and hopefully none of you have to

731
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,559
file a claim because it usually means

732
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,000
something bad has happened

733
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,840
but what's the plan right and this is

734
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,080
basic business work and and

735
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,520
for small to medium business in

736
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,480
particular not very good

737
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,120
but i mean here's backups for the last

738
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,200
20 30 years still tape

739
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,600
and the tape store more

740
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,679
but many organizations

741
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:16,480
pay

742
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,679
ransomware

743
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,440
operators not because they don't have

744
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,640
backups

745
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,559
but because the downtime is more

746
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,600
expensive than the ransom demand

747
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,600
it is a math problem and in the western

748
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,320
world right business decisions are based

749
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,559
in mercenary math if you've got a cyber

750
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,400
insurance company coming in

751
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,480
decisions are really based on mercenary

752
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,440
math

753
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,840
you know the actuaries come in and say x

754
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,279
is greater than y

755
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,880
so we're doing y

756
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,440
full stop right

757
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,919
to solve that problem right is is either

758
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,080
create resiliency or to create

759
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,159
resiliency and have faster recovery

760
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,480
times

761
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,159
but to talk about living off the landing

762
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,480
powershell in particular right

763
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,559
powershell is a fantastic tool to manage

764
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,480
the windows environment

765
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,840
i don't know for sure because i'm an

766
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,760
anti-microsoft bigot and i try to avoid

767
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,240
managing anything in windows but

768
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,919
i hear from people that it's very

769
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,360
important in fact i think there's a way

770
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,200
to put powershell on linux

771
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,679
you know for linux admins who have an

772
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,760
appropriate sense of self-loathing

773
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,760
but everything that admins like about

774
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,000
powershell the attackers really like

775
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,520
i don't know that anybody's replicated

776
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,039
this study but i think 10 years ago

777
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,440
somebody said for every 24 workstations

778
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,679
you need one support staff for every

779
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,440
like four servers you need one support

780
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,000
staff nobody operates even at an

781
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,720
enterprise level of that kind of

782
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,279
manpower it just doesn't exist

783
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,120
so you've got to have automated tools to

784
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,240
do things

785
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,320
right powershell is a great way to do it

786
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,919
right and the attackers know it's built

787
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,200
into windows

788
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,159
um

789
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,520
but there's some simple things that

790
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,039
people can do right you know there's

791
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,440
only very specific people who need to be

792
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,919
executing powershell in an environment

793
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,679
in your production environment anyway

794
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,520
right those are your system admins maybe

795
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,360
your network admins depending on how you

796
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,760
define your duties right all of these

797
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,760
can be signed so you say oh the

798
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,480
powershell script drops by whatever it's

799
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,240
not signed by the trusted environments

800
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,720
key so i'm not going to execute it right

801
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,960
so as long as you're doing

802
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,039
proper pki and protecting that private

803
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,279
key and ideally doing separation of

804
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,960
duties where the person writing the

805
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,039
powershell script isn't the one signing

806
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,960
it executing it

807
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,120
you've got a pretty resilient system in

808
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:27,919
there

809
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:28,799
that

810
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,480
your devops guys are probably going to

811
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,480
hate but generally speaking in

812
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,480
production at that point it's it's your

813
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,399
it operations and not devops unless

814
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,439
you're talking about cloud

815
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,480
apt nation state threats basically do

816
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,679
the same thing

817
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,000
but for somewhat of a different reason

818
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,720
right most of our attribution of which

819
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,520
state or agency is involved in attack

820
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,919
it often takes place in malware analysis

821
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,279
because it's really hard to write

822
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,799
software

823
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,520
that's anything remotely complex

824
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,880
you know and

825
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,039
nation state software engineers do the

826
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,880
same thing that normal software

827
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,159
engineers do

828
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,399
copy and paste as much as possible

829
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,559
nobody likes re-implementing functions

830
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,640
which means oh once we attribute a

831
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,640
function we see where it is then we can

832
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,320
start saying oh these are all together

833
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,440
and oh by the way this is gre or the pla

834
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,600
or whoever right

835
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,600
scripting language and scripting the

836
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,120
scripting right you can redo that all

837
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,880
the time usually it's smaller right and

838
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,080
depending on what you want to do it's

839
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,480
straightforward usually all the apis and

840
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,399
things that you want to do

841
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,159
are already present in said scripted

842
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,760
language

843
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,760
and our endpoint and detection

844
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,840
methodology of those kind of malicious

845
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,640
behaviors is essentially non-existent

846
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,120
i cannot create a malware signature for

847
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,679
a bash script or a python script or

848
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,000
a powershell script

849
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,840
unless it's some very specific

850
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,399
obfuscation which is trivially changed

851
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,399
which means my detection doesn't matter

852
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,320
right you can do behavioral based stuff

853
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,520
we'll talk about that a little bit

854
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,480
but this development comes about for one

855
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,399
specific reason

856
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,240
is that everything we do to protect

857
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,039
environments is essentially public

858
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,200
we have conferences we talk about it

859
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,600
right you know there could be somebody

860
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,080
affiliated with the mss in this room

861
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,919
i doubt it i've had msfs scoped my talks

862
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,399
before it's actually quite hilarious

863
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:25,840
like trade shows they want to scan

864
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,200
badges with t-shirts you just send them

865
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,520
up hey kind of scan your badge oh

866
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,120
okay you're a spot

867
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,559
um

868
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,360
so

869
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,880
um

870
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,320
but everything they do is essentially

871
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,600
private

872
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,039
you know in the united states i mean

873
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,480
we've got our own hackers we get cyber

874
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,080
coming we've got an nsa right all that

875
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,960
stuff

876
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,840
top secret sci if that stuff hits github

877
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,080
somebody's going to prison right

878
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,360
um

879
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,960
they can see what we're doing we can't

880
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,960
see what they're doing until they've

881
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,200
done something and we reverse engineer

882
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,440
it and hopefully we see it

883
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,720
which means

884
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,120
defense is always harder in a sense than

885
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,799
offense

886
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,960
that's the world we live in

887
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,200
so as an example of a new apt threat

888
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,880
right there's something just obscures i

889
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,360
think it's just hilariously genius

890
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,279
we don't know what state did this i

891
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,799
guess we're assuming it's nation state

892
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,720
by the context this is mandiant's

893
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,799
research not ours so i mean props to

894
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,240
them for finding it

895
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,600
but you know

896
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,520
there was malware they found that

897
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,440
stashes hidden data in a clf clfs log

898
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,960
file

899
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,440
i'm not a windows guy i mean i look up

900
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,919
what clfs logs are but i don't know that

901
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,279
i've ever come up with them being

902
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,440
stashed in splunk or a sin

903
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,200
you know it's it's stored for like mass

904
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,080
registry changes so it's a obscure log

905
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,320
file that no one ever looks at

906
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,240
now granted the best practice since i

907
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,200
don't know

908
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,320
1990 was an annual review of log files

909
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,559
and it was absurd back then

910
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,399
right you know here we are they're using

911
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,240
obscure log files that probably aren't

912
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,480
ingested anywhere to stash data

913
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,519
it's hilariously ingenious right

914
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,120
um

915
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,279
but mandiant also included some

916
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,960
detection launcher which i think is

917
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,480
important to point out because this is

918
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,559
how we need to find these kind of things

919
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,440
is you know any process you know writing

920
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,320
to or loading this specific dll or

921
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,960
loading two specific dlls

922
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,279
right is now we're looking at patterns

923
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,039
instead of signatures

924
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,640
right and that's how we're going to need

925
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,799
to find stuff signatures are still

926
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:27,840
useful

927
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,000
right you know for easy things and we'll

928
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,679
talk about this

929
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,320
but we need to move beyond hey this ip

930
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,640
is bad this domain is bad this hash is

931
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,279
bad or this signature or your rule

932
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,720
indicates bad

933
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,919
because you're not going to find the

934
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,600
most significant stop that way you're

935
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,159
not going to find ransomware lateral

936
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,080
movements in your environment with a

937
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,480
signature you'll find it with a pattern

938
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,840
so supply chain attacks i mean i

939
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,440
mentioned a couple of these already to

940
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,200
kind of spoil this slide it's top of

941
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,880
mind because

942
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,279
it makes good news right

943
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,200
you know the new york times or cnn will

944
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,919
cover this hack reached a thousand

945
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,320
organizations it's a splashy headline

946
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,120
right

947
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,120
but you know for every story of a

948
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,799
ransomware breach there's probably a

949
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,120
hundred that you don't hear about

950
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,600
you know and these scare people and in

951
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,760
part because nobody really knows how to

952
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,840
solve the problem because in essence we

953
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,880
can't

954
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,840
right

955
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,159
if the i don't know how many customers

956
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,559
solarwinds has it's a lot

957
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:31,600
you know

958
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,840
not one of them is going to be able to

959
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,559
do a manual source code audit of

960
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,279
solarwinds pilots

961
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,360
more importantly i mean the original

962
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,440
supply chain vulnerability is microsoft

963
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,240
windows really everybody has it

964
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,640
right you're going to do a source code

965
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,480
you know microsoft employees have a hard

966
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,799
time getting access to any real amount

967
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,159
of source code because it's highly

968
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,120
protected intellectual property

969
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,440
you could do a third-party audit right

970
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,600
you know saying hey you're stock to this

971
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,440
you got this certification

972
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,440
but you know for those older in this

973
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,120
room we all know that compliance doesn't

974
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,640
equal security and often often they

975
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,559
you know there's third-party risk firms

976
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,919
that try to do

977
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,720
you know some level of approximation hey

978
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,559
this company might be less safe than

979
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,279
others but that's imperfect too reality

980
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,720
since we can't solve the problem the

981
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,720
attackers know that

982
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,240
it's not new

983
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,919
but because we've adopted cloud

984
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,120
technology right it's a bigger problem

985
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,559
right you wouldn't be able to have a

986
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,039
scale of a compromise of going after

987
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,960
azure and reaching thousands of

988
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,760
companies 20 years ago

989
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,519
right even having the zero day at

990
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,240
microsoft and compromising lots of

991
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,720
infrastructure is not trivial depending

992
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,120
on the zero day right wannacry was

993
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,360
probably the last last major example of

994
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,600
a nice normal event

995
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,960
right you know

996
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,240
um

997
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,640
i i used to teach i was about to take

998
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,440
worms out of my class and then monica

999
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,720
after thinking that we're never going to

1000
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,240
see a worm again because that's not the

1001
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,600
world we're in

1002
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,919
and we're still kind of there

1003
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,679
well i said there isn't much we can do

1004
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,599
about it you know we try to make it less

1005
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,839
safe we can try to reduce the risk

1006
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:14,639
right

1007
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,320
and solar winds because of the way they

1008
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,079
operated right if you were looking at

1009
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:19,599
dns queries

1010
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,119
you'd be able to find some interesting

1011
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,440
queries in there that were pathological

1012
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,359
if you're looking for things that just

1013
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,239
should not be query or are abnormal you

1014
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,679
would have seen it

1015
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,599
you would have known what it was but at

1016
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,918
least it gives you a warning hey humpty

1017
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:36,000
go figure out why these endpoints are

1018
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,239
doing this this that happens to have

1019
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,399
solarwinds on it or iran and i think

1020
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,320
it's a product off the top of my head

1021
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,000
which shouldn't be query and stuff like

1022
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,119
that

1023
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,480
you know and hopefully they reverse

1024
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,079
engineered enough to figure it out or at

1025
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,679
least say you know what

1026
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,359
we need to sit there and uh you know

1027
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,199
block some network access to this device

1028
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,199
until we figure out what's going on

1029
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,839
or bernie that why is any solarwinds

1030
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,680
device reaching out to random places on

1031
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,560
the internet in the first place

1032
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,760
uh so cryptocurrency has enabled a lot

1033
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,800
of cyber crime ddos uh extortion

1034
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,079
ransomware

1035
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,920
the lack of centralized authority means

1036
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,119
there's no one there to protect your

1037
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,640
losses

1038
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,200
so um you know there's lots of scans out

1039
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,119
there that are that are that are there

1040
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,720
but i'm just going to talk about ddos

1041
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,040
extortion ddos has been around for 30

1042
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,000
years

1043
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
ddos is actually the original kind of

1044
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,560
gamer exploitation it's the gateway drug

1045
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,440
teaching teenagers how to be hackers

1046
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,839
other countries find these individuals

1047
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,440
and bring them into into their

1048
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,680
equivalent of the ic fault

1049
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,520
you know because hey you get around with

1050
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,400
you know

1051
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
kicking people off the internet to win

1052
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,880
it fortnite i don't what do kids play

1053
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,400
these days i don't know

1054
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,680
right

1055
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,359
uh but there are people out there who

1056
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,760
simply launched low-level ddos attacks

1057
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,680
spending some voter service five bucks

1058
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,040
say hey

1059
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,079
give me 50 000 bitcoin and we'll call it

1060
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,599
a day

1061
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,119
they get paid even though there's really

1062
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,160
no real real threat behind it

1063
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,760
you know it comes and goes i don't know

1064
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,920
every year or two that crop up they go

1065
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,839
away they crop up they go away for the

1066
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,760
past 10 years give or take

1067
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,280
uh so

1068
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,880
but fundamentally

1069
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,880
what's ddos protection

1070
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,320
that's you have something in front

1071
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,000
blocking the bad traffic you just have a

1072
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,800
big enough pipe to be uh to withstand it

1073
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,400
you know

1074
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,680
can't really solve the problem because

1075
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,200
fundamentally it's not a problem for

1076
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,200
organizations to solve it's a fun bits

1077
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,920
of of networks and networks and places

1078
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,440
that don't cooperate with the united

1079
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,839
states

1080
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,800
i like using the slide a lot that's

1081
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,520
statistics from virus total

1082
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,760
virus total is the single largest

1083
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,839
malware honeypot in the world

1084
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:51,759
because everybody submits files to it

1085
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,560
on a given day right now that looks to

1086
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,680
me like about 900 000 samples unique

1087
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,920
detected by one agent well one engine

1088
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,040
more

1089
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,119
the scary line is one that you can't see

1090
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,599
between the orange and yellow uh the the

1091
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,520
orange and red one right because there's

1092
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,880
a certain amount of malware that's

1093
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,680
malicious that nothing is detected

1094
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,440
obviously we can't we can't measure an

1095
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,880
unknown but it's somewhere between that

1096
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,800
red and orange line right

1097
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,320
that's that's where the unknown threat

1098
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,280
lies

1099
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,040
that's what patterns can help us

1100
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,720
everything with the red line and under

1101
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,480
we've got a signature form

1102
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,520
right

1103
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,680
nobody really likes antivirus because we

1104
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,640
know it's not 100 effective

1105
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,400
i don't really care that's not 100

1106
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,880
effective if it can get rid of 70 of a

1107
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,560
low red nonsense

1108
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,240
then there's less work i've got to deal

1109
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,040
with

1110
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,279
right

1111
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,520
ultimately like a math game i'm trying

1112
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,839
to give myself less work to do because

1113
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,680
i've got more than enough and we still

1114
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,119
don't have enough people working in the

1115
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,720
industry

1116
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,520
the

1117
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,359
cynical and sarcastic way of addressing

1118
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,599
this problem is this

1119
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,839
because i think it's hilarious right the

1120
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,560
scale of our vulnerability landscape is

1121
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,079
more than the attackers can deal with

1122
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,520
too

1123
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,880
and this didn't come from a technical

1124
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,880
publication it came from the onion which

1125
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,560
makes it that much more fun

1126
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,440
um so you know even even people outside

1127
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,599
the industry kind of know right it's

1128
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,280
we're adopting technology we can't

1129
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,640
secure and we're putting it in more

1130
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,160
stuff you know we've never secured

1131
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,680
and just in the side of like medical

1132
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,800
devices

1133
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,599
right

1134
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,520
you know mris were perfectly secure

1135
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,920
until somebody stapled a pc with windows

1136
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,599
xp on

1137
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,440
and it's windows xp because that was the

1138
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,200
last operating system that microsoft

1139
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,280
spent real effort to make for embedded

1140
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,280
or iot devices

1141
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,040
but nobody really thought an mri machine

1142
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,119
should last 30 or 40 years

1143
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,119
we're stapling an operating system that

1144
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,119
lasts that gets eol back to three or

1145
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,119
four

1146
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,359
you have no good answers now right and

1147
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:50,960
you can't patch it because of medical

1148
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,960
compliance you're creating all sorts of

1149
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,320
problems because you have one threat

1150
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,480
model with windows xp you're putting it

1151
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,240
into something else

1152
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,000
no one redid the threat model to say hey

1153
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,359
wait a second

1154
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:04,480
this has got to last decades not years

1155
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,440
um

1156
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,599
so

1157
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,720
lots of compromised information out

1158
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,320
there

1159
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,760
there's an entire marketplace for

1160
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,920
compromised machines and accounts

1161
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,760
because the attackers are stealing so

1162
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,000
much they're trying to find new ways to

1163
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,839
monetize it

1164
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,320
crypto mining uh you know botnet crypto

1165
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,040
mining came about because

1166
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,640
people that operated banking and credit

1167
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,480
card trojans on machines are basically

1168
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,079
waiting around if you enter your credit

1169
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,760
card information

1170
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,440
well they want to make some money in the

1171
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,119
meantime

1172
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,119
mining cryptocurrency and consumer

1173
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,200
machines is not lucrative

1174
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,800
right you might make a couple of bucks a

1175
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,400
month maybe a couple tens of bucks a

1176
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,000
month but if you have a button at a

1177
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,839
quarter million nodes that's sitting

1178
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,440
around most of the time

1179
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,079
you know you multiply two bucks a month

1180
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,160
times a quarter million machines that's

1181
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,599
real money that you're just sitting

1182
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,760
around collecting right

1183
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,520
uh you can use it for credential stuff

1184
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,440
all right there's huge repositories of

1185
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,760
stolen usernames and passwords how do

1186
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,160
you validate that right i can't just

1187
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,520
spit up a vps somewhere in ukraine

1188
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,880
to do it

1189
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,280
but i can use somebody's compromised

1190
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,119
machine in nebraska

1191
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:15,920
right

1192
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,000
it's easy to compromise grandma and

1193
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,240
nebraska or

1194
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,920
kids who are just downloading games off

1195
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,680
the internet right there's no shortage

1196
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,599
of compromised machines out there that

1197
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:26,960
you can find ways to leverage for

1198
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,920
malicious purposes and modeling that is

1199
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,200
kind of hard because in the end of the

1200
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,040
day what's the difference between

1201
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,040
grandma and nebraska who wants to access

1202
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,200
her online banking account and grandma

1203
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,119
in nebraska who wants to access her

1204
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,960
online banking account but her pc is

1205
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,000
infected

1206
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,359
and used as a credential stuffing

1207
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:45,759
network

1208
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,280
a lot of the scale of this problem you

1209
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,040
know does the idea that automation can

1210
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,720
fix or help

1211
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,440
and superficially that's true

1212
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,359
there are more jobs than we have people

1213
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,040
there's a need for more skills than we

1214
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,200
have right you know there's an entire

1215
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,000
ecosystem of security providers because

1216
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
even major companies can't hire enough

1217
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,839
security people to secure their own

1218
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,440
environments it just doesn't it doesn't

1219
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,599
scale very well so almost every

1220
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,760
enterprise has security providers

1221
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,240
you know any company could hire incident

1222
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,440
responders

1223
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,240
they hire mandates to do the work or

1224
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,560
crowdstrike for somebody else

1225
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,400
one solution of security automation

1226
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,400
right or other forms of machine learning

1227
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,560
in ai

1228
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,920
it in theory can reduce workload right

1229
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,760
but the fundamental computer security

1230
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,599
problem is how to process untrusted data

1231
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,000
and get trusted outcomes

1232
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,680
and we have not solved that problem

1233
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,160
since it was identified i mean it's

1234
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,160
identified probably in the 80s

1235
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,200
popularized by how to smash the stack

1236
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,599
for fun and profit in frack magazine in

1237
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:54,640
the early 90s in buffer overflows

1238
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,240
but it's the same fundamental problem

1239
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,079
what causes the buffer over the the

1240
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,760
problem of buffer overflows is the same

1241
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,599
as the problem with sql injection and

1242
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,280
the same problem we're seeing in machine

1243
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,880
learning and artificial intelligence

1244
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,680
right

1245
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,520
but there's this idea

1246
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,160
math will set us free it's unbiased it's

1247
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,400
math

1248
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,160
well

1249
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,280
no

1250
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,440
because your math has to be based on

1251
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,400
data humans decide on

1252
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,359
based on features that humans select for

1253
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,359
outcomes that human beings want to

1254
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:26,880
achieve

1255
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,480
and what we've noticed

1256
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,599
is that while machine learning is good

1257
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,160
at some things it's bad at others

1258
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,040
um

1259
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,319
and it is

1260
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,160
in some cases like facial recognition

1261
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,480
technology as an example

1262
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,079
works pretty good against people like me

1263
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,960
less accurate on african americans

1264
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,560
okay well if you're facebook what's the

1265
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,960
impact of that probably not a lot

1266
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,880
if you're a law enforcement agency using

1267
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,960
it and you start arresting the wrong

1268
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,079
people

1269
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,800
well now you've got a constitutional

1270
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,480
rights issue that you're correct

1271
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,240
i don't know why this problem exists i

1272
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,680
don't know anybody's figured out why it

1273
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,440
exists but it does

1274
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,920
so quite literally machine learning is

1275
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,480
creating systemic bias and systemic

1276
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,359
racism in the actual strict definition

1277
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:14,880
of systemic

1278
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,119
probably not a good thing right but the

1279
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,880
threat model has changed facial

1280
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,760
recognitions in facebook is good enough

1281
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,560
facial recognitions for law enforcement

1282
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,000
maybe we want to add up a couple of

1283
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,960
extra controls in there

1284
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,079
yeah exactly right

1285
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:33,920
well input validation right poison

1286
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,280
dataset same same problem

1287
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:40,480
my phd is in machine learning creating a

1288
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,480
model to model just i want something to

1289
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,040
be able to tell me is this domain good

1290
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,359
bad or i don't know

1291
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:49,440
i managed to get a model to about 100

1292
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,359
accuracy as long as i allowed i don't

1293
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:54,319
know as an answer right so if there's 90

1294
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:56,560
confidence or higher decide somewhere in

1295
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,440
the middle say i don't know and you know

1296
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,880
there you go right you know somewhere in

1297
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,560
the middle you don't know that's what

1298
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,920
you need to do work on your models

1299
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,280
figure out why it doesn't matter right

1300
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,119
is there features you need to look at is

1301
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,119
their data bias any number of things

1302
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,200
that's not the point of this

1303
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,000
i created this model 2019 let it cook

1304
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,160
for a good long time because i don't

1305
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,520
want to be blocking doing false

1306
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,720
positives

1307
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,880
nobody fires a security vendor for false

1308
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,640
negatives

1309
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,240
they fire security vendors for false

1310
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,760
positives

1311
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,599
that i would argue is a problem but i

1312
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,359
don't win that argument because i sell

1313
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:30,160
things

1314
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,520
you know i have to do what the customer

1315
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,400
wants

1316
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,680
so

1317
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,520
it looks at various attributes of dms

1318
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,880
we'll skip past that for people who

1319
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,920
don't know it

1320
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,160
but it broke catastrophically in march

1321
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,960
2020 has anybody ever in here in your

1322
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,040
career ever broken production

1323
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,200
significantly

1324
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,800
everybody has a rite of passage you're

1325
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,520
not really in i.t until you've broken

1326
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,440
production right

1327
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,160
it's a rite of passage

1328
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,680
usually you don't do that in your 40s

1329
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,200
i did

1330
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,440
what happened march 2020 right the

1331
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,839
pandemic hit and then everybody packed

1332
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:07,599
including government agencies

1333
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,680
we have to respond to this you know

1334
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,240
there was real concern that a risk of

1335
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,000
what was going on was the breakdown of

1336
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
the social worker right that was kind of

1337
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
the case people were operating so

1338
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,160
government agencies who are the most

1339
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,079
strict about change control and

1340
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,319
infrastructure through all the red tape

1341
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,079
out the window and in care they're

1342
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:28,400
setting up dashboards in this business

1343
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,520
to figure out we need to get the

1344
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,839
information off the public stay home

1345
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:33,920
figure out unemployment all of the

1346
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,599
things that were going on

1347
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,520
my motto started flagging public health

1348
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,160
authorities and knocking them offline

1349
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,480
in my career i didn't think i would rise

1350
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,240
to level the false positive of

1351
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,599
interfering with the public health

1352
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,200
authority during a global pandemic

1353
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,319
sorry the math said it was bad

1354
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:53,839
does not save you

1355
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:56,640
um you know the impact was solved fairly

1356
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:57,920
quickly

1357
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,839
but the reality is this is like reality

1358
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:01,839
changes underneath you and threat models

1359
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:04,400
change very quickly and hopefully we

1360
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,319
will never experience a pandemic like we

1361
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:08,720
have the last couple of years as long as

1362
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:09,839
i'm alive or my children or

1363
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,680
grandchildren alive maybe it's a once a

1364
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,240
century event and move on all right but

1365
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,240
these things can break very bad

1366
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,680
so how to get started machine learning

1367
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,200
than ai

1368
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,440
you know open up a terminal you know

1369
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,599
install the sk learner library and start

1370
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,280
coding it's very simple

1371
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,880
right people focus on machine learning

1372
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,839
and ais if it's complicated math

1373
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,680
sk learners a couple of other libraries

1374
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,720
do what makes math easy for you

1375
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,240
which is a benefit

1376
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,079
and a cost

1377
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:43,760
anybody can do machine learning which

1378
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,640
means anybody can do machine learning

1379
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,240
it's the same problem with the lampstand

1380
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,560
when it's a patching by sql php it made

1381
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,240
it possible for anybody to create a web

1382
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,000
app and they did

1383
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,640
which created a huge landscape of

1384
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,319
vulnerable web apps

1385
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,800
and later vulnerable mobile apps which

1386
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,680
in some ways are basically web apps

1387
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,520
you know doing all sorts of interesting

1388
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,920
things that create all sorts of risks no

1389
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,680
one ever really invented or

1390
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,640
thought of when making this uh ecosystem

1391
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,480
that we enjoy to create new technology

1392
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,960
so what to do about right those of us

1393
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,200
work in organizations we can't control

1394
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,079
floss and vendor software right you know

1395
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:25,760
smaller vendors you can go put through

1396
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,079
the paces of i want this i want that

1397
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:29,680
right no one's going to get a source

1398
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,319
code audit of microsoft windows except

1399
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:35,920
maybe the department of defense

1400
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,920
you know the fundamental problems that

1401
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,760
incentivize ransomware and cyber crime

1402
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,520
aren't going to change anytime soon

1403
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,280
right we're not going to solve global

1404
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,760
prospect global law enforcement

1405
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,359
you know some countries right a lot of

1406
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:50,720
bec and romance scams operate in nigeria

1407
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,040
the nigerian government is sincerely

1408
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,599
helpful or the fcc is

1409
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,520
you know but it's also a third world

1410
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,960
country there's only so much they could

1411
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,760
do

1412
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,280
right um

1413
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,440
so maybe we can solve that cod one day

1414
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,359
but it's not here today right

1415
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:08,720
you know hitting the wrong button on our

1416
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,119
remote control is no problem

1417
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:13,760
so what can we do about it

1418
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,920
we know a lot about the threat landscape

1419
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,440
you go back to the virus total slide

1420
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,440
right there's 900 000 now we're samples

1421
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,280
that we can detect

1422
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,680
um block them and forget it right

1423
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,400
there's a notion of reticence of just

1424
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,160
i don't want to block for fear or false

1425
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,640
positives right i think there's things

1426
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,440
that you can do to minimize the impact

1427
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,599
of specific false positives

1428
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:36,800
but really we've got to block the

1429
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,880
low-rent stuff there's only so much

1430
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,880
human energy going around

1431
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,440
and you know a multitude of alerts

1432
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,400
drowns out more important things

1433
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,200
and there's been public cases of that

1434
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,359
sim isn't bad as long as you're not

1435
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:54,000
using it as a digital dumpster

1436
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,680
right you know checking off the box of

1437
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,359
centralized logging

1438
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,680
right you go in there and you've got

1439
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,520
logs from your firewalls your networks

1440
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,760
and your dns results and your exchange

1441
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,480
server your ad and this uh and and maybe

1442
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,720
hopefully you get your edr in there and

1443
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,920
now you can sit there and say oh i've

1444
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,760
seen this network event and this network

1445
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,280
pattern and this behavior when i'm host

1446
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,040
opening these files

1447
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,720
now you can start doing real hunting

1448
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,359
versus signature-based stuff

1449
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,640
um

1450
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,240
breaking down the wall between network

1451
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,240
system and security right is that people

1452
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,480
say hey i'm network operations i'm

1453
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,880
system admin i'm security we all can't

1454
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,760
work together well the reality is the

1455
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,760
difference between system administration

1456
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,359
and system security

1457
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:37,280
really just needs to go away and the

1458
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,640
same thing with network security and

1459
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,599
network operations right uh those need

1460
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:43,839
to come down so that those

1461
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:45,359
because all the defenses are either

1462
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:48,480
applied on an endpoint or on a network

1463
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,240
device

1464
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,800
everybody has firewalls very few people

1465
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,720
are actually putting intelligence into

1466
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,559
their firewalls because network

1467
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,319
operators want to pass packets with as

1468
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:00,240
little friction as possible and security

1469
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,920
wants to block all bad

1470
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:02,880
and

1471
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,240
you have to stand off and that's not

1472
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,839
good

1473
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,440
every time we adopt the new technology

1474
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,720
needs to be somebody looking to threat

1475
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,839
model

1476
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,760
right the risks

1477
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,599
from a webcam on my laptop are very

1478
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:15,680
different than risks to the camera on my

1479
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,440
phone you know

1480
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,040
you know if i want to harass somebody or

1481
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,559
i want to steal information i want i

1482
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,319
want their device if i want to kill

1483
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,079
somebody i want their phone

1484
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:26,160
right there's an entirely different risk

1485
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,240
landscape there

1486
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,920
we need to focus on making things

1487
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,079
resilient right is that there's going to

1488
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:33,359
be things that get through there's going

1489
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:35,200
to be business operations that are

1490
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,040
interrupted how do you get around that

1491
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,800
uh with ransomware there's a lot of

1492
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,319
people focused so we can detect this

1493
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:42,000
rant somewhere i mean there's a machine

1494
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
learning uh tools out there to detect

1495
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,400
ransomware encrypting documents

1496
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,319
great by the time that's already

1497
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:50,240
happening you're already sol right you

1498
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,720
know you need something upfront uh or

1499
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,359
something to respond quickly

1500
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,480
you know because failures are always

1501
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,440
going to happen and sometimes people who

1502
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,599
moonlight as academics break things in

1503
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:04,480
catastrophic ways

1504
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,160
but we're probably not going to get out

1505
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,599
of firefighting though

1506
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:09,200
right you know there's a number on older

1507
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,520
people in the room so some of those some

1508
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,440
some of this matters but i think about

1509
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,960
this because of some recent incidents

1510
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,040
right there's a security researcher who

1511
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,800
would die recently you know we do have

1512
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,800
suicides in our industry there's a lot

1513
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,839
of mental health issues because

1514
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:25,839
similar mental stresses to firefighters

1515
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:27,760
and police and pandemics you're doing

1516
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,359
the same thing all the time you're

1517
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:30,240
seeing

1518
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,400
the bad outcomes happen all the time and

1519
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,680
there's very little that you can do

1520
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,760
about it

1521
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,440
creates a mental health

1522
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,160
health tool right so celebrating small

1523
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,200
victories

1524
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,800
uh and taking care of your own mental

1525
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,680
health

1526
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,200
actually having work-life balance i

1527
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,640
think we made a joke before the talk

1528
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,400
started what's the weekend

1529
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,480
you know well it used to be when i could

1530
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,000
work from home for a couple of days and

1531
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,520
i have to go to the office but now we're

1532
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,680
all working from home in a pandemic

1533
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,760
you know of taking time off because it

1534
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,319
is a stressful ministry and we have lost

1535
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:01,920
some of our colleagues

1536
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,000
due to suicide and other things because

1537
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,839
of the unique strains

1538
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:08,400
are not unique here the similar strains

1539
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,640
first responders have in their work

1540
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,559
so be mindful of that

1541
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:13,920
with that

1542
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,200
maybe

1543
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,960
i will take questions

1544
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,400
and if you want to copy my slides

1545
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,079
there's my contact information i'm happy

1546
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:22,400
to share

1547
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:30,079
just one thing there are no scrolling a

1548
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,000
window

1549
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,079
exactly i have another way of saying the

1550
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:35,839
windows will win there almost there are

1551
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:37,520
no small ones

1552
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,000
right so

1553
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,359
i'm trying to think of how many

1554
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:42,880
different criminal cases i've helped

1555
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,000
investigate

1556
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,040
dozens at least i've only got two

1557
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,319
indictments

1558
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:50,880
one arrest one guy right no actually he

1559
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,680
didn't do time and he actually basically

1560
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,200
processed after the bureau of prisons

1561
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,200
and then walked out

1562
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,280
that's the closest to putting somebody

1563
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,760
behind bars i've ever gotten spending

1564
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,839
years of effort on some of these cases

1565
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:05,839
as somebody who just got processed and

1566
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:07,920
blocked out you know early in my career

1567
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,720
i used to be able to get the money back

1568
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,680
now it's likely i'm not going to so if i

1569
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,200
did any money

1570
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,960
yeah it's a win

1571
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,800
yeah unfortunately carrying out

1572
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,480
consumers

1573
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,079
that are losing the money and they don't

1574
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:25,680
have insurance right yeah i mean

1575
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,558
there's often very little

1576
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:40,569
[Music]

1577
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,079
so

1578
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,319
if i can paraphrase the question you

1579
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:12,640
know with iot right and we're putting

1580
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,640
new devices online

1581
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,680
in some ways have some of the

1582
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,440
vulnerabilities that devices had 20

1583
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,640
years ago

1584
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,520
all right

1585
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,640
now

1586
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,720
the number of embedded iot machines that

1587
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,160
have telnet run

1588
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,640
a protocol i thought being murdered 10

1589
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:30,480
years ago that somehow came back

1590
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,960
the fundamental problem there is people

1591
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,280
making mri machines are medical

1592
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,480
equipment manufacturers not i.t system

1593
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,839
integrators

1594
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:43,440
so i haven't learned any of the lessons

1595
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,720
the single biggest improvement to cyber

1596
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,000
security in my career in two decades

1597
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,079
was when microsoft made

1598
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:54,880
software updates default applied

1599
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:55,680
you know

1600
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,920
not patched

1601
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,480
because nobody patched crap

1602
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,520
you know they realized that you know

1603
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,559
we're going to make that the default

1604
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:04,160
behavior your machine's just going to

1605
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,799
remove on tuesday hi

1606
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:09,359
tremendous gains in cyber security that

1607
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:11,119
nobody in the iot or embedded system

1608
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:13,680
world knows because they're not iot

1609
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,040
integrators

1610
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,079
they're

1611
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,680
siemens who make industrial control

1612
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,640
system not not that they've

1613
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,440
right

1614
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,400
these are people who are car

1615
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,480
manufacturers so the same thing right i

1616
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,720
think cars you know

1617
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,880
no one's there thinking about it

1618
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,280
so part of this cyber security needs to

1619
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,119
talk about these other manufacturing

1620
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:34,559
disciplines

1621
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:36,720
so i'm kind of trying to encourage that

1622
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,079
community college

1623
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:40,559
and university levels of saying

1624
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:42,400
please get people thinking about this

1625
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,400
the mentality

1626
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,640
of what could go wrong

1627
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,559
and it kind of works in the western

1628
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:50,400
world when i was an adjunct you know

1629
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,920
live for six years

1630
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,920
i'd start my class with this exercise

1631
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,920
here somebody think of some new

1632
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,160
technology somebody would name something

1633
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:03,040
right now tell me how you kill somebody

1634
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,799
the asian students they didn't

1635
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:06,160
understand how to process their

1636
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,400
questions and cultural differences so i

1637
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,000
kind of had to be really careful about

1638
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,799
how i played this you know the americans

1639
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,480
you know we're okay with it but the

1640
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,559
fundamental thing is this thing is like

1641
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:18,559
think of what bad could happen

1642
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:19,839
legitimately

1643
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:22,640
and that is a very specific small subset

1644
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,280
of the human population to do that

1645
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:29,520
in essence non-weaponized sociopaths

1646
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,040
i don't know

1647
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,640
right normal people don't think of how

1648
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,119
to kill other people

1649
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:37,040
but you know if you're doing a

1650
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,040
self-driving car

1651
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,520
that's legitimate thing to concern right

1652
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,760
what can i do to trick this car in

1653
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,760
thinking that that pedestrian is a

1654
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,200
sidewalk

1655
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,559
or uh

1656
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:50,319
crosswalk right on the street

1657
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:51,839
which is a very specific failure that

1658
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:53,839
didn't leak

1659
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:55,839
so i mean emerging technology i'm not

1660
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:59,200
working just at the machine learning

1661
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,079
is being in the right place at the right

1662
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:08,160
time and asking the right question oh

1663
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,240
you're adopting this technology here

1664
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,799
have you thought about x

1665
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:14,559
now the answer is going to know and if

1666
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:15,839
you're lucky you would start thinking

1667
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:17,200
about it
