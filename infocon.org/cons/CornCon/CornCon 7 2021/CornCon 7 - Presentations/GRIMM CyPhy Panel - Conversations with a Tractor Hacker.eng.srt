2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,840
hello

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,280
just made it in time how are you

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,600
good hello greetings all uh my name is

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,520
matt carpenter i helped found the sci-fi

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,199
team here at grim

7
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,760
grim is a cyber security uh research

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,599
firm with a heavy emphasis on reverse

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,320
engineering and vulnerability research

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,760
the sci-fi team specifically focuses on

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,000
the smaller things in life those that

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,040
are

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,800
don't typically have a keyboard and

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,760
mouse

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,680
anything that's embedded

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,640
that hits a lot of vehicles including

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,120
tractors

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,280
so embedded systems has had an impact in

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,840
a wide variety of markets like

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,760
tractors and satellites and aircraft and

21
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,440
cars

22
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,160
and heavy trucks and those are important

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,520
because

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,199
well we'll get to that

25
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,720
so let me

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,840
i

27
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,000
bear with me i have had technical

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,119
difficulties for the last 10 15 minutes

29
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,760
and i'm having to use my phone here let

30
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,520

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,400
so

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,320

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,399
director for the cyber physical systems

43
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,360
team here at grimm

44
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,880
hi i'm morgan whitlow i'm a senior cyber

45
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,040
physical security researcher at graham

46
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,960
one brief sentence

47
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,279
thank you

48
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,040
uh my name is donna somerville and i am

49
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,200
a junior cyber physical security

50
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,399
researcher erica

51
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,520
my name's jamie lightfoot i'm a

52
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,239
mid-level security researcher here at

53
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,239
grimm

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,760
that leaves aaron and jesse

55
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,560
i'm mario

56
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,800
senior

57
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,200
go ahead

58
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,040
no i'm jesse raleigh i'm a senior

59
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,480
security researcher at grimm

60
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,680
so aaron we're oh she's really

61
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,680
i can't recognize you jesse

62
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,440
uh

63
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,239
that's the idea and that leaves aaron

64
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,840
although aaron seems to be having some

65
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,840
technical difficulties right now

66
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,360
um

67
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,840
not like jesse's where justices are

68
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,319
intentional

69
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,879
so this is going to be very free form

70
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,920
uh we are happy we want

71
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,920
participation from the audience

72
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,599
uh bring your questions bring your

73
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,840
thoughts i've got some some seed

74
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,800
questions but i'll be watching the uh

75
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,159
i'll be right actually somebody else

76
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,800
will be watching the chat because i

77
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
can't do that very well on my phone and

78
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,599
see anybody

79
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,080
all right

80
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,840
can you how is this

81
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,480
we can hear you and see you hooray my

82
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,599
technical

83
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,959
difficulties are fixed anyway

84
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,799
uh your name which is kind of already

85
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,360
moot and one brief sentence let's see

86
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,120
how creative you get

87
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,720
well i'm not gonna be very creative

88
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,200
sorry i'm a senior uh security

89
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,120
researcher here on the cyber physical

90
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,680
systems team

91
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,400
excellent

92
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,959
thank you so that's uh that's the team i

93
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,200
know jen is in the audience there she is

94
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,400
uh she's

95
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,239
blending in

96
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,519
but she actually leads

97
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,560
the entire sci-fi team and a lot of

98
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,840
other things here at grimm she is

99
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,640
amazing

100
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,440
so we uh we wanted to start off

101
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,600
and guys if if there are questions

102
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,000
please bounce something in in chat

103
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,680
because i won't be there i won't be able

104
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,720
to necessarily see it or just speak up

105
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,320
um

106
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,360
but

107
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,520
we have been spending the last

108
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,800
seven years

109
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,880
hacking on vehicles we started off with

110
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,040
cars and we've gotten into

111
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,199
a lot of heavy trucks

112
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,440
and then from there branched off into

113
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,919
other things that bear similarities to

114
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,840
heavy trucks such as most of your

115
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,320
tractors

116
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,440
tractors are in fact if you were to tear

117
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,199
them apart and put them on a book on a

118
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,479
board

119
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,479
uh you would

120
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,919
you might be able to see the difference

121
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,199
between a tractor and a heavy truck but

122
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,720
there's a lot of similarities there

123
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,199
there's there'd be only a few telltale

124
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,680
signs

125
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,320
so that leads actually to my first seed

126
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,080
question and this should hopefully get

127
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,199
us started

128
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,720
but

129
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,400
it's gonna sound lame but bear with me

130
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,840
what is attractor

131
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,840
audience participation included but we

132
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,759
uh but we have the experts here that i

133
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,800
want to hear what they have to say

134
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,360
well i guess i'll start off with my

135
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,960
answer

136
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,919
tractor is a

137
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,560
a modern tractor i suppose the ones that

138
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,840
we're talking about

139
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,360
is a

140
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,840
a rolling

141
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,560
control plan

142
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,199
cool a very time sensitive rolling

143
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,600
industrial control plan i you and i were

144
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,800
chatting earlier i remember hearing

145
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,160
yesterday

146
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,440
i did forget about the time sensitive

147
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,919
part good point good addition

148
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,520
thanks i came up with that myself

149
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,160
anybody else let's let's dig into that a

150
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,440
little bit

151
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,080
any uh any thoughts

152
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,080
an industrial automotive piece of

153
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,720
equipment designed for farming for

154
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,560
taking care of fields and harvesting

155
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,880
plants and seeding and all of that good

156
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,080
jazz

157
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,800
okay what makes up a tractor what

158
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,720
that maybe that's what makes a tractor

159
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,840
but what's the tractor like

160
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,520
more importantly

161
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,160
why do i care as a cyber security

162
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,039
engineer or an attacker what do i care

163
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,080
about a tractor

164
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,560
the equipment

165
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,720
i was gonna say the uh

166
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,000
somebody else should probably take this

167
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,039
actually i've spoken already

168
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,199
go morgan we uh

169
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,840
sorry for the delay

170
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,120
i think we've had a little bit of lag

171
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,960
here that's uh knocking us out of sync

172
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,360
slightly

173
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,599
yep go ahead morgan

174
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,800
um

175
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,720
supply chain uh

176
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,319
tractors

177
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,919
protectors are behind

178
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,520
corn and a whole bun

179
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,560
as we are at corncon um

180
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,680
agricultural thing agricultural stuff uh

181
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,120
cotton clothing stuff all kinds of

182
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,199
anything that deals with plants that a

183
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,319
mass

184
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,080
industrial scale

185
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,960
if that's disrupted if that's held

186
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,599
hostage like by a ransomware attack

187
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:42,720
it's a

188
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,280
vital critical system that is

189
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,240
got a very juicy attack surface uh

190
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,840
through its equipment if it's not

191
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,638
properly cared for

192
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,560
okay

193
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,720
very good so that's the impacts jesse go

194
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,720
ahead

195
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,599
uh the

196
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,000
reason it's such an appealing target is

197
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,560
because of the economic impact of

198
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,240
attacking the equipment

199
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,319
um you know morgan touched on the

200
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,479
ransomware side of it but if you're a

201
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,759
larger scale

202
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,240
bad actor you could be targeting it

203
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,560
simply for the economic impact and the

204
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,319
disruptions that would result from that

205
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,759
supply chain attack etc

206
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,639
okay

207
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,080
aaron i know you're you're busting at

208
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,639
the seams so so say it anyway all right

209
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,360
all right sure um i mean supply chain is

210
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,760
obviously something we've seen uh very

211
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,958
visible

212
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,399
supply chain interruptions is something

213
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,479
we've seen very visible in the past few

214
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,640
years here

215
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,440
and that's just due to

216
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,720
well

217
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,680
you know pandemic and production issues

218
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,279
but in terms of tractors and agriculture

219
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,800
that's obviously on the supply side of

220
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,640
things and the supply chain interruption

221
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,600
there would be could be very dramatic

222
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,959
obviously

223
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,560
agriculture farming

224
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,320
food production is a very time sensitive

225
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,880
thing has to be in the right exact

226
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,720
geographic location for the equipment to

227
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,959
do the right thing you have to make sure

228
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,320
that the

229
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,600
different things happen on a very

230
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,880
precise

231
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,600
time schedule

232
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,600
you uh the

233
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,760
window for planting for seeding for

234
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,040
harvesting can be very small and also

235
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,360
is impacted by the weather as well so

236
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,680
all of these things make it a thing that

237
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,959
needs to be done

238
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,240
on a precise schedule very quickly

239
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,560
and if you screw that up

240
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,440
well

241
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,560
then you've got disruption

242
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,399
all right i just got an audience

243
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,399
question what's the day in the life of a

244
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,200
tractor hacker

245
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,360
all right so you want the audience to

246
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,800
tell you what they think

247
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,079
and

248
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,480
no this is this was for the uh

249
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,720
sorry this is from the audience

250
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,560
for in the chat experts here

251
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,959
it yep be a lot of a lot of dirty work

252
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,720
taking things apart getting to the

253
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,880
physical systems and the tractor

254
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,959
as matt mentioned earlier a lot of the

255
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,519
work that we do is on the the physical

256
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,399
computers in the the tractor or the car

257
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,920
or the truck

258
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,959
um

259
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,279
and seeing how they can be attacked and

260
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,040
protects refers to hassle there can be a

261
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,000
lot of

262
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,560
you know spending time actually removing

263
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,120
panels and taking these components out

264
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,320
so we can analyze them more carefully

265
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,360
and more thoroughly

266
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,200
tap it into the various communication

267
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,440
networks on the vehicle that we're

268
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,079
looking at and analyzing the bus traffic

269
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,440
and seeing what what attacks we can

270
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,480
uh you can go from there

271
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,720
so what kind of communications

272
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,920
technology do we find in tractors

273
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,959
uh these days

274
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,120
pretty much all of it um

275
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,160
there's

276
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,480
there's mobile apps for phones to

277
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,399
communicate with the individual

278
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,880
telematics systems

279
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,680
there's lte connections so that the

280
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,040
individual

281
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,640
devices in the field be it a tractor or

282
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,839
one of the

283
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,399
connected appliances to the tractor

284
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,279
can communicate there's gps sensors um

285
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,120
the buses are

286
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,240
are numerous

287
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,079
i could add on something else to the

288
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,160
hacker question that you post matt um

289
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,519
if we

290
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,240
uh so grim is a consultancy and we

291
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,720
usually have some kind of

292
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,920
time

293
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,680
limitation to our project so we're

294
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,920
trying to think of like what is the

295
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,440
the impact that a customer or a company

296
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,440
would be worried about and then we try

297
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,920
and find ways

298
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,240
in at least in my case to telematics

299
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,120
units or other connected parts of a

300
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,399
vehicle

301
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,680
to try and reach that so you know maybe

302
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,839
can i

303
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,839
can i put

304
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,560
bad firmware onto a tractor or can i

305
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,480
somehow get to the cloud and do that at

306
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,240
scale so

307
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,120
what a life is what a day in the life of

308
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,760
a tractor hacker or a car hacker or

309
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,040
whatever is

310
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,839
for us largely defined by

311
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,560
kind of the worst case scenario supply

312
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,639
chain or other issues

313
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,480
um because that that's what we're trying

314
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,480
to mitigate against there also is a lot

315
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,639
of like curiosity in our team you know

316
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,720
there are a lot of interesting

317
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,160
kind of weird corners in the

318
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,560
technologies but um

319
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,360
usually our work and what we dig into

320
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,440
and the rabbit holes that we go down are

321
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,839
largely motivated by

322
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:14,639
um

323
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,200
kind of the the impact that our

324
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,079
our

325
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:23,519
customers or end users are worried about

326
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,680
yeah our scrums would make most scrum

327
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,959
masters have a connection

328
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,160
completely confirmed with creative uh

329
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,399
with creative discussion but it is it's

330
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,519
amazing

331
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,399
so how do you

332
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,920
if you're going to target

333
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,240
a tractor in

334
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,440
say boise idaho

335
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,360
and you wanted to

336
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,639
take over

337
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,199
one tractor or all of the tractors of a

338
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,680
particular type

339
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,199
what would you do

340
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,560
how would you go about that what would

341
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,319
that project look like

342
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,120
uh can i just case

343
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,519
budget is budget is not just

344
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,079
it's not a big option but don't go on

345
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,760
don't go insane

346
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,680
yeah go ahead uh

347
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,440
so i would first identify

348
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,480
the larger dealerships for the equipment

349
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,199
i'm looking to target in the region

350
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,199
and i would do

351
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,920
you know basic recon on who works there

352
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,800
who works in field service

353
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,639
how long they've been there

354
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,680
and i would most likely approach that

355
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,199
with a phishing campaign to try to

356
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,880
harvest some credentials to get access

357
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,760
to

358
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,320
the control panel that gives them

359
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,959
observation over the entire fleet within

360
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,560
their region

361
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,839
um

362
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,240
in terms of like if the goal is to get

363
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,240
all of the machines then i would start

364
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,560
with the place that likely has access to

365
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,560
all of the machines which is typically

366
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,839
the dealer and repair network

367
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,360
that is a definitely a fun

368
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,720
attack rep

369
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,880
i think maybe you should also add in

370
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,199
that in addition to our scrums being

371
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,279
full of curiosity they're also really

372
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,839
morbid

373
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,800
or maybe morbid's not the right word

374
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,399
kind of uh

375
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,199
dark

376
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,359
yeah

377
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,680
for similar projects we usually begin or

378
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,360
at least i've usually begun with the

379
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,639
hardware

380
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,600
um

381
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,120
and you try and figure out how to get

382
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,680
access on a single unit that you have

383
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,759
you know in your hands

384
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,720
so that involves a lot of

385
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,480
embedded systems and electrical

386
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,720
engineering hardware reverse engineering

387
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,279
knowledge and then once you get access

388
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,320
on the

389
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,480
the processor the computer running on

390
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,759
that board

391
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,160
um you can start to see okay here's the

392
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,240
connected cloud service here are

393
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,839
vulnerabilities here but you do need

394
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,399
some kind of

395
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,040
wireless connectivity or remote

396
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,240
management capability

397
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,279
to

398
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,680
do a tax at scale which is why

399
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,519
when we work with customers to improve

400
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,880
their security we we are always like

401
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,040
focusing on the the remote part

402
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,560
i let me let morgan go

403
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,440
oh

404
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,759
sorry it yeah it always starts with

405
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,880
research um know your target know what

406
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,199
what kind of system you're going after

407
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,279
know if it like jamie was saying

408
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,360
broadcasts anything wirelessly does it

409
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,880
have an unsecured wi-fi access is their

410
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,639
bluetooth connection that you can join

411
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,800
uh does it require any kind of pairing

412
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,360
or code or is it just anyone can walk by

413
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,800
and connect to it

414
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,320
um

415
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,480
is are there any default security

416
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,880
measures in place and if there are are

417
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,120
the credentials a common heart set thing

418
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,680
that is known

419
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,079
grace i would add on one small piece to

420
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,800
that is that the uh the strategy to go

421
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,880
about you know attack in a cyber

422
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,880
physical system is essentially the same

423
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,319
types of strategies that you would do in

424
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,439
any type of attack you start with recon

425
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,959
and then you kind of look for your

426
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,640
attack surface that's your scanning and

427
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,880
then you know it goes from there

428
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,280
so the phases are effectively similar

429
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,119
it's just you have a different types of

430
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,280
technology that you're potentially

431
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,839
looking at

432
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,640
okay

433
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,480
um i'll add in that uh there is a point

434
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,720
where uh our research kind of crosses

435
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,640
over into more traditional red team

436
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,280
research where while hardware

437
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,880
and the firmware

438
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,320
differ greatly from traditional offset

439
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,000
there comes a point where they do

440
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,080
connect back to your traditional

441
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,400
back-end infrastructure where your

442
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,160
telematics units

443
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,960
are being controlled and

444
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,480
by a server hosted in aws their

445
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,039
communications in the cloud over just a

446
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,160
bunch of api calls

447
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,600
great

448
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,918
great context

449
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,400
so how did you guys get it get to

450
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,080
be here

451
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,520
or or more

452
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,679
more pointedly how does somebody become

453
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,240
like you an embedded systems reverse

454
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,919
engineer or exploiter

455
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,240
i don't know i don't think any of us got

456
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,160
here the same way yeah

457
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,360
i think we all got here through a

458
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,360
different path

459
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,360
there's not really a singular way in

460
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,039
right now there's a

461
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,799
um

462
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,559
i mean there's common paths in a lot of

463
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,559
us have like an engineering or computer

464
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,120
science background but i think that

465
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,840
maybe something that

466
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,840
um that the hacking community has in

467
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,720
common with um

468
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,280
with other communities such as farming

469
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,520
and agriculture is that there's a really

470
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,320
strong diy spirit um

471
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,200
a lot of us didn't you know like i don't

472
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,760
think any of us went to college for

473
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,320
hacking and security um

474
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,000
a lot of this was

475
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,080
taking things apart that were broken or

476
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,840
maybe things that weren't broken and we

477
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,080
just wanted to know how it worked

478
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,000
in my case i got into hardware reverse

479
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,600
engineering because

480
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,600
i had something that was broken

481
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,039
no one would give me

482
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,880
the documentation on how it was supposed

483
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,120
to work so i took it apart and figured

484
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,480
out

485
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,559
how to get it working

486
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,440
and that turned into a useful job skill

487
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,080
so a lot of it is just diy um you know

488
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,600
trying to figure out how things work

489
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,039
trying to figure out how to make them

490
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,720
work in a different way and then all of

491
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,039
us kind of stumbling into a career where

492
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,360
you can actually get paid to uh to take

493
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,959
things apart and tinker with them

494
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,159
yeah i i tell people before i was

495
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,000
officially a hacker

496
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,440
uh i did

497
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,919
embedded software systems development

498
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,600
integration testing

499
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,360
um i made made the different things that

500
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,320
i'm now

501
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,159
testing as a hacker and uh i tell people

502
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,720
that the skills for doing that embedded

503
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,559
development and hacking are probably

504
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,480
about you know for embedded security

505
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,640
hacking cyber physical systems

506
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,679
it's uh

507
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,440
you know probably about eighty percent

508
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,240
overlap um if you've ever had a cusp if

509
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,000
you're doing development you've ever had

510
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,159
a customer say here's this library we

511
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,440
want to use or we want to connect to

512
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,840
this piece of equipment

513
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,600
then and you've had a

514
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,039
and you've had to figure out how it

515
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,880
actually works because it doesn't work

516
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,280
the way the documentation says

517
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,039
then that's you know you're on the same

518
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,799
path right it's just being curious and

519
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,600
figuring things out

520
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,520
so

521
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,559
um

522
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,120
in my case i actually did go to school

523
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,360
and have some reverse engineering in

524
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,320
school

525
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,440
uh there didn't

526
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,559
anyone over anyone from

527
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,280
a certain time period back got into the

528
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,320
space completely through must through

529
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,679
hacking and everything that's where a

530
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,440
lot of the

531
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,640
stories you'll hear in the hacking

532
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,840
career about oh yeah i got i got broke

533
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,720
into like my school system or broke into

534
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,039
xyz computer type thing that's where a

535
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,120
lot of those and then i eventually ended

536
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,720
up in this that's where the field

537
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,559
started these days it is actually

538
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,400
possible to go to school and take

539
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,960
courses on things like network security

540
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,000
reverse engineering um digital forensics

541
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,320
all of that kind of thing

542
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,640
in my case i was mostly going for

543
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,640
development until

544
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,720
i actually discovered through a hacking

545
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,720
conference um

546
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,720
that reverse engineering was a thing um

547
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,480
actually that's not completely accurate

548
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,720
my my introduction to the fact that to

549
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,360
reverse engineering as existence

550
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,520
was a job interview where they didn't

551
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,919
tell me what i was interviewing for

552
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,240
um so i showed up and they started

553
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,559
asking me all these questions and i had

554
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,400
enough background to sort of muddle my

555
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,640
way through and keep guessing things

556
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,120
but not quite enough to get the job

557
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,720
after that they started mentoring me

558
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,760
though and it was became a oh you mean i

559
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,919
can actually try to break into and

560
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,760
access these systems

561
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,200
and not be the bad guy which was a lot

562
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,960
of fun um

563
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,120
and that started me down its whole other

564
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,039
path although for the longest time i was

565
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,280
doing lock picking rather than direct re

566
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,960
so that's a different story anyways

567
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,799
do we have any questions from the

568
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,520
audience uh we're getting into the

569
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,760
getting into about almost halfway

570
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,960
through

571
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,080
love to hear from the audience if you

572
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,400
have any questions speak up or or

573
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,600
go into chat

574
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,159
dr johnson is there some special magic

575
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,520
they have to do some incantation or

576
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,520
animal they have to slaughter

577
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,679
no

578
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,280
wrong kind of farming this is corn

579
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,799
okay we didn't hear you bryson

580
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,200
all right something fun we've hacked

581
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,440
that we can talk about

582
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,840
uh generically speaking generically

583
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,480
speaking uh

584
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,480
jamie i'm going to point to you i'm

585
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,400
going to throw that question in your lap

586
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,039
tell me something that you put on you

587
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,200
uh i got to hack an atm so

588
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,919
we got a atm delivered and got to

589
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,159
get some developer access to it and

590
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,799
figure out

591
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,480
if i were some kind of cyber criminal

592
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,320
wanting to get a whole bunch of money

593
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,559
you know spit out money from the atm

594
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,559
sort of thing how would we do it um we

595
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,480
got to do a really cool demo of that

596
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,799
nice

597
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,640
what about some of the telematics stuff

598
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,480
that you packed recently

599
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,760
without names or specifics obviously

600
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,000
um

601
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,840
yeah go

602
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:22,080
ahead without names or specifics um

603
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,679
i'm not i'm not sure what i can say

604
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,080
without

605
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,760
okay um

606
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,720
some of the things that we've been

607
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,039
talking about where you get access to a

608
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,919
single board a single pcb and then you

609
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,039
can

610
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,960
get access to the cloud back end and

611
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,600
then you could hypothetically you know

612
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,600
use that one

613
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,679
device that you bought off of ebay or

614
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,480
wherever else

615
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,120
to talk to other devices

616
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,360
and find a lot of shared vulnerabilities

617
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,919
between them and potentially

618
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,640
take over multiple devices we have found

619
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,480
that not in

620
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,600
agriculture but in another industry

621
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,400
which is fun um doesn't really

622
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,279
make me sleep great at night but uh

623
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,240
it's technically interesting

624
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,000
let me ask is this why you didn't fly

625
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,640
here no

626
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,039
see i'll offer when i was

627
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,960
i was working on a on

628
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,640
an embedded system

629
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,440
not too long ago where

630
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,159
they had checked all the boxes

631
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,799
and you know they shut off this they did

632
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,880
secure booting they

633
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,760
uh

634
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,320
they used encrypted file systems which

635
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,840
kind of baffled me for a while

636
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,679
um and

637
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,520
you know we

638
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,279
got through that first barrier and we

639
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,919
got we got shell on the box and then

640
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,279
we

641
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,440
uploaded like a stripped down linux

642
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,400
distribution but we were able to

643
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,080
upload uh various tools like gdb

644
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,720
to to debug the running processes

645
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,279
and then they they had encrypted file

646
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,960
systems for all the goodies and that you

647
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,159
know stuff

648
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,600
and so

649
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,240
and they store the keys inside the chips

650
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,440
security

651
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,039
secure area

652
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,799
but we were able to

653
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,720
take the debugger and work through the

654
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,360
code and say okay there are the keys

655
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,440
that are stored in the uh

656
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,480
in the

657
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,120
internal systems the the hsm security

658
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,240
module

659
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,039
uh here's how this works oh and by the

660
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,799
way before i even got to this point they

661
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,640
decrypted the file system for me and

662
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,960
there it is it's like

663
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,799
okay

664
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,120
um

665
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,440
jimmy

666
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,679
uh

667
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,760
i've already picked on you enough

668
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,279
erin what are some of the lessons that

669
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,360
you would take away

670
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,720
from

671
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,240
the interesting things that you've

672
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,360
hacked over the last several years

673
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,159
in

674
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,720
this space

675
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,799
um

676
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,840
let's see

677
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,830
most interesting things i've hacked um

678
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,720
[Music]

679
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,159
most interesting things are probably a

680
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,039
bit more geeky than some of uh

681
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,320
i don't know how interested some of the

682
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,760
audience is because it's a lot of you

683
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,399
know here's a board running this

684
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,039
particular architecture that i we can't

685
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,360
find any good tools to do reverse

686
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,120
engineering on and so it's you know

687
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,559
figuring out how to do reverse

688
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,760
engineering and figure something out of

689
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,039
that

690
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,279
as far as most interesting it's it has

691
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,880
been uh it is lots of fun to be able to

692
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,320
execute code from one ecu

693
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,279
and then uh be able to pivot to you know

694
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,720
be loading

695
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,320
implant on a different ec you want to be

696
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,600
a goal and

697
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,120
seeing what can be done with that that's

698
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,039
fun being able to affect the control

699
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,880
systems of a vehicle at speeds in ways

700
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,000
it's not supposed to be those are

701
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,200
interesting

702
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,640
i always

703
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,080
try to do it safely

704
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,840
of course but

705
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,760
it's uh very interesting to be able to

706
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,960
demonstrate that type of thing

707
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,399
very cool hey tim what about you

708
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,520
drones are always fun

709
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,440
okay tell us about that

710
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,440
uh

711
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,760
yeah the control system for drones some

712
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,640
of them are just fairly simple wi-fi

713
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,720
access point so don't really have much

714
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,200
control or security

715
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,120
on the link so doing things like taking

716
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,120
over a drone and flying it somewhere

717
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,960
else is

718
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,960
sometimes possible

719
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,600
various manufacturers have gotten too

720
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,559
different

721
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:49,200
lengths to secure that attack surface

722
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,440
indeed from from easy to heart i i

723
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,960
understand

724
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,960
um

725
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,679
any details in

726
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,200
that would which would be interesting to

727
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,880
the audience

728
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,039
uh

729
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,520
nothing much i can talk about

730
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,200
yeah it does seem to be the sucky part

731
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,320
of this um

732
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,600
yeah did you did you have phil's

733
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,720
question

734
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:25,120
[Music]

735
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,520
have you have you worked on on airplanes

736
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,840
and in that industry

737
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,520
anything that you can you can share

738
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,600
without attribution

739
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,279
or whatever

740
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,559
you we don't care if you have

741
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,000
attribution that's

742
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,840
your

743
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:43,279
call we like to hear the dirt but yeah

744
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,880
aaron and tim

745
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,480
yeah so uh

746
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,080
uh part of my background when i was

747
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,880
doing development and creating systems

748
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,760
is working and developing and testing

749
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,520
aviation systems

750
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,960
so i've got background i've got a

751
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,960
background in creating them also we have

752
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,720
done some testing of them

753
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,640
of some aerospace components

754
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,480
when it comes to security for aerospace

755
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,960
things it's

756
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,320
uh what's the best way to say this

757
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,000
when it comes to security of aviation

758
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,960
systems it depends a little bit on

759
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,039
how

760
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,880
what the particular thing you're testing

761
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,720
is the attack surface is a little bit

762
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,799
different it's not like you know it's

763
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,279
within range of a great deal of uh you

764
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,840
know the entire earth for um

765
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,960
most of the time it's in operation but

766
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,320
when it's on the ground and it's in

767
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,360
maintenance there's a little bit

768
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,960
different attack surface

769
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,200
it's

770
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,640
i don't know it feels like about what i

771
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,360
can say i suppose

772
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,440
fair enough

773
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,720
it's always interesting going from

774
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,200
industry to industry thinking about the

775
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,360
differences and how the industries view

776
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,519
themselves and what

777
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,799
they see as being the threats and and

778
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,240
what they don't really aren't really

779
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,880
concerned about like aviation in

780
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,760
particular generally

781
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,760
especially in like the commercial

782
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,279
airplane type

783
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,440
you know of course like airplanes rely

784
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,600
heavily on their physical access

785
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,360
controls to the airplane that you know

786
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,279
you can't just walk out

787
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,200
on into the airport and walk up to an

788
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,960
airplane and plug something into like

789
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,360
that there's not really a way for you

790
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,880
know so an unauthorized person to

791
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,320
do that sort of thing

792
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,679
to the point of possibly over reliance

793
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,159
whereas in you know agriculture it would

794
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,159
be fairly easy for somebody to do that

795
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,320
to a tractor you know they usually not

796
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,880
store enough disorders out in fields or

797
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,480
out in

798
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,440
you know loaf in chat or you know

799
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,039
outside of the dealership

800
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,600
and in terms of getting the in terms of

801
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,240
reconnaissance uh aerospace presents uh

802
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,159
some difficulties also

803
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,360
because it's uh it's a a little bit

804
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,480
trickier

805
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,720
of a thing to

806
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,640
you know you can't just go on ebay and

807
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,399
get an airplane

808
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,559
uh like you can rent a car for looking

809
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,640
into it uh you can't just go but they're

810
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,279
harder to deal with they're harder to

811
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,679
deal with the components themselves are

812
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,200
worth a lot more even when an airplane

813
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,399
is no longer in use so they get

814
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:23,200
repurposed and reused and sold off

815
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,080
so

816
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,840
uh the reconnaissance part of

817
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,200
reconnaissance scanning is a little bit

818
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,039
trickier unless you've got an actual uh

819
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,519
you know uh unless somebody with the

820
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,279
equipment contacts you for doing

821
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,640
research

822
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,640
there's some that are available through

823
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,519
various universities but that's one

824
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,919
model that you have to work through that

825
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,080
university's uh

826
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,320
rules of engagement and it's not the

827
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,159
same as being able to tear it apart and

828
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,480
make the magic smoke go bye-bye a couple

829
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,000
times and

830
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
yeah right

831
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,760
yes i will

832
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,919
you tell the audience that uh they

833
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,360
shouldn't hack the airplane on the way

834
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,919
home they shouldn't try to uh lying

835
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,120
actually

836
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,519
that is inadvisable

837
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,880
uh it's not about poorly it's

838
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,519
one part of aerospace is that these the

839
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,679
concerns are about the same as any other

840
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,080
industry that has computers controlling

841
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,399
physical things right the concerns and

842
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,000
the potential impact

843
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,919
are there's similar levels of concern

844
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:31,519
and impact across all of these different

845
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,919
industries

846
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:34,799
the

847
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,320
biggest challenge is that there's

848
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,000
access is one of the bigger challenges

849
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,880
attitudes or the the historical view of

850
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,559
the industry in terms of their own

851
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:45,960
security

852
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,440
[Music]

853
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,559
has uh

854
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,640
you know it's not changed as quickly in

855
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,720
aviation as it has in other industries

856
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,799
the aerospace village

857
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,799
at def con has been

858
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,320
i think has done a really good job of

859
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,919
kind of bringing this a little bit more

860
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,200
into the

861
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,320
at least make it a little bit more

862
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,159
accessible put some resources out there

863
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,919
and a little bit more than they have

864
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,600
been in the past well not a little bit a

865
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,440
lot more in the past

866
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,280
uh and then especially like the hakasat

867
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,960
uh ctf challenge those have been

868
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,760
fantastic for being able to get a view

869
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,839
of some of the different uh i guess some

870
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,280
of the view of the problem space in

871
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,599
terms of

872
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:22,800
aerospace

873
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,599
uh security and hacking that's obviously

874
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,280
a bit of a satellite view instead of an

875
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,760
airplane view but the systems are have a

876
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,000
lot of similarities

877
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,918
you bring up villages it's a very good

878
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:37,199
point i know the grimm is involved in

879
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,199
many of the villages including the

880
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,280
biohacking village the aerospace village

881
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,480
the car hacking village the ics village

882
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,399
and i think i'm forgetting one other

883
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:47,440
that we

884
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,199
have invested people

885
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:53,118
we've also taken part in hacksad but

886
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,960
why

887
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,520
yes this is a test

888
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,480
why do we do that guys

889
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,640
because it's fun

890
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,560
spreads awareness spreads awareness and

891
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,760
helps see

892
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,880
the

893
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,800
spreads awareness and helps bring other

894
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,800
people into the fold so more people are

895
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,640
looking at this more people are

896
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,760
learning how to do the same kind of

897
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,520
things that we do also more people who

898
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,520
use these products or develop these

899
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,440
products can be aware of some of the

900
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,880
issues or some of the vulnerabilities

901
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,880
and they can head it off not just in the

902
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,800
existing products but things that are to

903
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,720
come

904
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,480
we'll say for people who are learning

905
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,040
new stuff for people who aren't familiar

906
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,400
with villages um defcon which is a big

907
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,280
security conference out in las vegas has

908
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,960
villages which other conferences have

909
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,359
now too and they're all self-organized

910
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,680
like mini conferences around a certain

911
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,599
area so there's

912
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,920
there the aerospace one there's car

913
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,760
hacking there's a drone one there's um

914
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,599
there's like a maritime one hopefully

915
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,560
we'll see an agriculture one um

916
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,760
you know after

917
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,960
uh after this pandemic hopefully

918
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,119
um but all all community organized um

919
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,760
where individual hackers and specialists

920
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,680
and then their companies that support it

921
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,680
come in and put together

922
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,320
material to help spread awareness and

923
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,720
and recruit people into

924
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,160
improving the security in whatever

925
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,760
industry or area

926
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,760
so there's there's an altruistic part of

927
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,599
it that i'm hearing that we want to make

928
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,280
the world a better place there's a

929
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,400
connection part of it we want to want to

930
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,240
get to know other people in the same

931
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,480
headspace and so much goodness can come

932
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,839
from there and there's an educational

933
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,200
piece those are the three i've heard so

934
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,560
far

935
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,839
anything new

936
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,400
oh okay well i was going to say uh in

937
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,400
terms of the educational piece i think

938
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,720
one important part of this is that in

939
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,240
every single i said there's a lot of

940
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,839
different industries right that have

941
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,320
these cyber physical systems security

942
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,839
concerns

943
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:56,960
one of the

944
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,960
biggest reasons for that is that the

945
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,640
people who make the equipment in those

946
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,000
different industries

947
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,359
are

948
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,599
experienced in

949
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,240
you know they've got experience in the

950
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,560
making their products in their industry

951
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,280
they don't have experience in the

952
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,359
security concerns around adding

953
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,960
different types of technology to them

954
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,560
like network connectivity and

955
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,960
centralized server access

956
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,960
so in

957
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,480
in reality they shouldn't need to have

958
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,520
that experience either you can't uh it's

959
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,200
not productive for most people making

960
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,359
devices to have to be experts in

961
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,839
everything to be able to make products

962
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:34,880
so that's

963
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,119
part of the job that i see us in in

964
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,720
terms of security professionals security

965
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,400
researchers part of the job of the

966
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,440
villages

967
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,839
the more we want to

968
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,480
more we're able to spread knowledge

969
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,000
among the people who at least a little

970
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,359
bit of knowledge and experience among

971
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,599
people who make these devices it helps

972
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,800
to increase the awareness and increase

973
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,320
and bring

974
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,160
more higher levels of security to those

975
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,879
different industries

976
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,160
you

977
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:02,960
uh

978
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,560
along with what aaron was saying but

979
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,240
also matt you mentioned the

980
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,359
altruistic aspects of it there is an

981
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,040
there is also a certain level of

982
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,040
enlightened self-interest it's a great

983
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,280
way to network with other people in

984
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,640
community it's a way for us to we get to

985
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,200
learn a ton as well it's not we are the

986
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,720
founder of all knowledge we get to take

987
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,000
in uh

988
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,280
information about what's current in the

989
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,040
field new technologies that are coming

990
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,000
out uh letting other people know hey we

991
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,359
exist this is the kind of thing we do

992
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,920
let us help you brings in good business

993
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,280
um it's

994
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,000
a very multifaceted thing that villages

995
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,599
and outreach

996
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,520
it's got all kinds of altruistic reasons

997
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,839
and it's got all kinds of practical

998
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:48,720
uh reasons

999
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,720
absolutely

1000
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,160
so

1001
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,640
where do we see tractors and cyber going

1002
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,759
in the next 10 years

1003
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,200
and

1004
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,800
is there anything that we can do to

1005
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,680
curtail the risk that is

1006
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,320
inherent in increasingly connected and

1007
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,760
intelligent

1008
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,800
tractors and vehicles

1009
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,720
is there a is there an audience question

1010
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,480
that i missed here yeah

1011
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,560
there is

1012
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,599
i'm sorry i didn't see it

1013
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,320
such as

1014
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,440
hey john could you repeat that please i

1015
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,599
can't i couldn't hear it it was muffled

1016
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,320
yeah do you want to come up here and

1017
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,400
i i don't know that i can remember all

1018
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,960
that you said

1019
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,440
he was talking about

1020
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,599
emergent properties and systems of

1021
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,839
systems but he's kind of come up and

1022
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,480
asked the question

1023
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,640
phil's question was easier yeah

1024
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,760
airplanes but all right john why don't

1025
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,280
you ask the question

1026
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,839
uh the question was is the industry

1027
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,160
starting to look into vulnerabilities

1028
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,520
that emerge

1029
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,240
from systems of systems so in the food

1030
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,000
chain industry

1031
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,119
the whole

1032
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,640
farm to table

1033
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,680
the tractor systems the grain elevators

1034
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,040
the wholesalers the retailers

1035
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:33,839
our

1036
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,160
researchers starting to look into

1037
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,480
the connection points and how

1038
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,760
vulnerabilities

1039
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,319
emerge when you have these systems

1040
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,079
developed by different people

1041
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,319
connected with apis and communication

1042
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,119
and

1043
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,640
all of that sure

1044
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,800
that is a really really difficult

1045
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,800
question to answer

1046
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,599
because does an industry

1047
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,800
each of the vendors

1048
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,760
have a different level of buy-in at the

1049
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,520
moment

1050
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,560
so we're looking at it

1051
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,960
is industry wow that's a really tough

1052
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,240
question to answer thank you for it

1053
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,240
but we've

1054
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,599
we've gotten

1055
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:17,839
we've gotten the sense

1056
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,599
that some vendors are a little more

1057
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,359
lackluster than others and some are

1058
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,280
really interested

1059
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,560
so

1060
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,560
take that for what it's worth so from a

1061
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,200
vulnerability standpoint um

1062
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,560
what about the

1063
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,800
you know what do you look at in regards

1064
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,040
to the supply chain

1065
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,880
not the not the system of system

1066
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,359
communication but the but just the

1067
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,920
supply chain being

1068
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,440
adding

1069
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,400
you know risk to the equation

1070
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,880
all the different parts coming together

1071
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,760
right

1072
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,640
yep

1073
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,960
uh so

1074
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,480
yeah that's a that's a great question

1075
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,240
i'm not i'm gonna try not to open my

1076
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,240
mouth too much on it and let the rest of

1077
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,040
the team play but uh

1078
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,839
yes so what you've just identified is

1079
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:07,119
that there are really two significant

1080
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,839
uh ways that we need to think that we

1081
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,599
that we do but that you need to think

1082
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:12,480
about

1083
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,560
uh vulnerabilities here first of all

1084
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,240
where do the parts come from in the

1085
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,480
supply chain where are the weak points

1086
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,319
and the ways to uh

1087
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,400
to inject malicious

1088
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,680
code

1089
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,359
or hardware

1090
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,440
and the other one is the system of

1091
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,440
system approach where we have a tractor

1092
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,440
that can drive itself but it's actually

1093
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,680
its connection to the cloud and its

1094
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,800
ability to potentially swarm

1095
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,560
that

1096
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,200
is a really much bigger existential

1097
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,960
threat

1098
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,839
but

1099
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,920
anybody uh want to respond to those

1100
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,680
from this so

1101
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,440
the interface between various systems

1102
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:54,800
say uh

1103
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,599
just

1104
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:57,680
the way that i think about the problem

1105
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,839
uh at least as i understand it as

1106
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:01,119
described is

1107
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,359
effectively when i look at an individual

1108
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,839
vendor or an individual platform of

1109
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,839
products within the agricultural space

1110
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:09,440
or really any space

1111
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,800
i think of

1112
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,599
devices as a tactical problem

1113
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,400
and the interop you know between the

1114
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,319
devices and various components within

1115
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,560
the overall ecosystem as more of a

1116
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,040
strategic problem right

1117
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,359
a disruption at one point in the

1118
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,440
agricultural supply chain

1119
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,000
might be far more impactful than

1120
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,160
being able to hack a specific model of

1121
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,560
tractor during the specific time of year

1122
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,200
so understanding where the biggest risk

1123
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,200
is and and where the

1124
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,560
the biggest impact could originate from

1125
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,319
is part of you know

1126
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:46,720
modeling the threat landscape at a at a

1127
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,800
higher level

1128
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,400
because of the nature of a lot of our

1129
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,240
work we focus

1130
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,560
quite a bit on the tactical level where

1131
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,560
it's do we how do we just secure an

1132
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,880
individual device or an individual suite

1133
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,359
of devices

1134
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,599
yeah what's the possible

1135
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,640
that's

1136
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,359
the question that we answer

1137
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,400
yeah um

1138
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,720
we're we're about at our time so yeah if

1139
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,920
you have some

1140
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,760
concluding remarks or if there's anybody

1141
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,520
who wasn't able to say something that

1142
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,319
they

1143
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,720
would like to get across um

1144
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,720
this would be the time to to do that we

1145
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,880
could keep talking about this and and

1146
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,040
hopefully you can attend uh in person

1147
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,680
next year things will be better um i i

1148
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,839
know that the audience would love to uh

1149
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,000
have a chance to sit down with you

1150
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,240
um this is a very interesting topic

1151
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,040
the question that i just threw out uh

1152
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,400
before

1153
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,760
before and we didn't get a chance to

1154
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,319
answer where do we see tractor the

1155
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,640
tractor space in agricultural

1156
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,160
and cyber in 10 years and what do we

1157
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,920
need to do now

1158
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,680
to try to avoid

1159
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,000
getting to and i could insert a number

1160
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,359
of different references but i'll just

1161
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:03,560
say skynet of trackers

1162
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,560
see that how do we see the devices

1163
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,480
i think i lost a word there uh how do we

1164
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,920
see the industry moving or what do we do

1165
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,760
to secure it

1166
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,599
what do we do to secure it where do we

1167
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:18,880
see it going

1168
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,000
i mean we've

1169
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,599
we've already seen

1170
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,720
swarms becoming the next direction

1171
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,000
right farms are just going to get

1172
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,240
smarter and smarter tech is

1173
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,119
going to seep deeper and deeper into

1174
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:32,560
every aspect of

1175
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,040
every just about every aspect of the

1176
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,119
operation

1177
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:40,480
smarter tools give lower costs lower

1178
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,560
labor

1179
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,319
but if you don't know how to use them

1180
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,440
they become their own kind of

1181
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,040
vulnerability that people aren't used to

1182
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,480
dealing with

1183
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,280
it is a really interesting opportunity

1184
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,160
in the ag space because

1185
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,560
you're not operating vehicles in the

1186
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,440
presence of civilians for the most part

1187
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,040
uh and so

1188
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,280
there's a lot more opportunity bleeding

1189
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,760
edge as far as automation

1190
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,040
um

1191
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:07,839
the

1192
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:10,560
being able to have different types of

1193
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,359
tractors or some systems operate in

1194
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:15,359
tandem together in a field

1195
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:16,640
um

1196
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,800
and it's kind of a double-edged sword

1197
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,240
because you get to do some really cool

1198
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,240
stuff you get to make some really good

1199
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,480
progress as far as

1200
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,839
the intersection between tech and

1201
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:29,920
agriculture but also

1202
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,760
because it's disconnected from the

1203
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,400
larger population at home you don't get

1204
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,960
as much attention on it as far as

1205
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,160
security goes right

1206
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,560
people may not really think it's as big

1207
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,359
of a deal to worry about it because it

1208
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,680
doesn't immediately impact someone's

1209
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,960
life but

1210
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,280
um people don't realize the supply chain

1211
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,000
issues that you know having a humidity

1212
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,200
controller

1213
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,880
in your silo connected to aws that isn't

1214
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,359
properly secured could mean

1215
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:04,400
that someone playing futures market

1216
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,400
could destroy a large portion of a crop

1217
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,720
across the nation in one fell swept just

1218
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,720
to make a profit and then people go

1219
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,480
hungry and i think it's real

1220
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,920
it's really interesting to see this

1221
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,319
start to develop and

1222
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:21,040
uh and to see different vendors care

1223
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,359
different amounts is uh

1224
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:26,000
also pretty interesting to watch

1225
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,319
and one of the things that i mean it's

1226
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,880
not reasonable to expect a farmer to

1227
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,240
have a cyber security expert on staff

1228
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,440
to maintain their fleet of tractors

1229
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,480
that's

1230
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,880
that doesn't sound at all reasonable

1231
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:44,400
um so as an industry

1232
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,760
a lot of times the big guys and the

1233
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,520
vendors have to take the hit for the

1234
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,119
smaller guys

1235
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:50,000
but

1236
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,680
you know

1237
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,240
yeah wow we're here to to help support

1238
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,000
you buy a computer you couldn't log into

1239
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,680
you can put a password on why would you

1240
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,119
do that with your farming equipment

1241
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:00,960
that's what makes you your profit well

1242
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,880
and i think was it morgan that made the

1243
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,119
comment about interfaces or started to

1244
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,760
um when you and we have to we'll

1245
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,160
conclude after this but uh

1246
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,839
i just want to make the comment that as

1247
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:12,880
these

1248
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,800
these are they are systems of systems

1249
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,160
like john said

1250
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,880
um that we have uh

1251
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,960
um the

1252
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,040
you know let's say it's a tractor

1253
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,640
let's say you have a truck that follows

1254
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,400
along and there's a communication

1255
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,319
there's some signal between that and the

1256
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,720
and the truck and it's not from the same

1257
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,680
manufacturer and now you have a sensor

1258
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,760
that comes from a third party

1259
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,200
that's it's dealt

1260
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,520
with humidity and maybe you're pulling

1261
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,079
in uh agronomic data from different

1262
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:43,119
sources

1263
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:44,960
um and so

1264
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,040
you know it really becomes

1265
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,079
lots of things communicating together

1266
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,079
and every time you have those interfaces

1267
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:54,000
there's uh an opportunity there's an

1268
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,359
opportunity for

1269
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:57,200
them to be exploited

1270
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,160
yep

1271
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,839
so so exactly what i was trying to get

1272
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,240
to there's going to be more more of that

1273
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,640
i think in the future with wanting to

1274
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,440
have this be more functional by having

1275
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,000
it play with other toys right and uh and

1276
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,839
so the risk is going to continue to go

1277
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:16,400
up and i think it's really important

1278
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,200
um

1279
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,960
i'll try to wrap up here i want to thank

you for for joining us this is an

1281
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:23,200
important topic and uh it's important to

1282
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,359
have researchers like you out there

1283
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,599
um who are who are digging into this and

1284
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:29,839
staying on top of the technology thank

1285
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:31,119
you for bringing it to the forefront

1286
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:34,559
through corncon dr johnson appreciate it
