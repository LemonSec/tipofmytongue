[Music]

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,690

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,519
uh fireside chat if you will

8
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,560
a little bit of distance between

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,400
everybody but that's probably

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,320
where we are for this probably not a bad

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,079
day no so

12
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,040

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,559
three gentlemen who know a lot of

22
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,480
cyber security because they are on the

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,440
receiving end of some of the

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,559
worst sorts of bad guys

25
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,280
and i'll let my colleagues introduce

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,200
themselves so

27
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,880
when you introduce yourselves let's get

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,040
a little bit of a bio

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,640
and then uh if you had a boat

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,960
what would the name of that boat be so

31
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,080
you make a

32
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,000
win the lottery

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
buy your yacht what name goes on the

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,880
back of your brand new yeah and why

35
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,159
john kniff

36
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,080
goo

37
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,400
well thank you aaron uh thanks everybody

38
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,040
for being here i'm john neff um worked

39
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,040
for kirkwood community college and the

40
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,320
cio there been there for about 16 years

41
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,200
prior to that um i worked for uci uh

42
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,840
telecommunications company uh that used

43
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,799
to exist and doesn't anymore but um

44
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,600
great place to get a start there

45
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,399
um so my boat

46
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,479
i would call it peace and serenity

47
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,399
because i think my daily life probably

48
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,840
uh doesn't typically have that and i'm i

49
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,240
am a big boater and fisherman and that's

50
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,520
why i like to seek out i guess uh in my

51
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,520
my spare time so

52
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,639
i'll hand it over to joel

53
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,280

and

63
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,480
the name of my boat

64
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,239
several things come to mind help is on

65
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,280
the way no uh hallelujah i

66
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,879
i don't know what i picked for a boat

67
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,040
name i'm not much of a boater or a

68
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,680
fisherman right now

69
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,560

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,360
security officer at mercy hospital cedar

72
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,560
rapids

73
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,040
i've been there for five years

74
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,080
if i had

75
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,599
a name i guess i would go with no

76
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,959
regrets

77
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,319
you know because i hope when i get to

78
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,000
the end

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,360
i don't have

80
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,800
anything to say that i have requests

81
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,440
about so that's kind of

82
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,239
yeah

83
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,959
not no reverse like the bad tattoos

84
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:11,760
um

85
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,239
so yeah

86
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,200
so to kick us off a little bit here you

87
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,640
guys are from

88
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,440
three um pretty different industries

89
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,680
right

90
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,560
education government and healthcare

91
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,120
and as a result of that you attract uh

92
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,799
some different sets of

93
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,640
challenges from a cyber security

94
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,319
perspective so

95
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,640
what would you say is unique about

96
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,799
the industry in the area that you work

97
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,879
in in terms of cyber security and

98
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,799
compliance what's different about what

99
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,879
you do

100
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,120
yeah i'll kick that off um

101
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,040
so in education particularly higher

102
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,519
education um it's

103
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,439
really open so you think about your

104
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,200
students you think about your guests

105
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,040
where the communities college is kind of

106
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,879
one of the tag lines so

107
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,040
we accept everybody on our campuses we

108
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,680
have seven different locations uh our

109
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,040
main campus and see if there's some

110
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,640
cedar rockets but

111
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,400
we have another campus in iowa city

112
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,560
that's pretty sizable and then some

113
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,720
smaller ones in our counties

114
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,399
and um

115
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,399
being that communities college means

116
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,639
that you're going to provide them with

117
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,960
particular services so it's

118
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,160
really

119
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,400
a challenge it's not like where i used

120
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,960
to work where you badge in or they

121
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,040
pull a gun on you and say no if you're

122
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,639
out of here type thing they would really

123
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,800
pull down but they wouldn't let you in

124
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,759
if you

125
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,440
didn't have a badge didn't sign it

126
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,960
didn't have

127
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,120
you know some sort of reason for being

128
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,360
there versus you know

129
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,240
a community college any college

130
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,520
uh k-12s are a little bit different uh

131
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,479
now

132
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,800
you know with resource officers and

133
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,479
locked doors and you've got to go to the

134
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,960
office and you're going to go and so on

135
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,440
but we remain really open so that's

136
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,360
that's definitely a challenge

137
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,199
i would say maybe one of the unique ones

138
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,520
for us

139
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,639
well one of my duties as the auditor

140
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,320
commissioner elections as i won

141
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,080
elections in the second largest county

142
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,520
in the state

143
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,520
and i think in

144
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,039
2016

145
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,120
the presidential election

146
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,880
was probably the last year that i would

147
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,520
say was normal in elections

148
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,680
and but it turned out it really wasn't

149
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,000
normal we found out a couple of years uh

150
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,039
later probably 2018 2019 that there was

151
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,880
attempts to hack into the election

152
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,520
systems in the country iowa was one of

153
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,680
the targets that did not

154
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,440
get anywhere

155
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,880
with it and now we move forward to 2021

156
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,919
five

157
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,800
uh five short years from 2016 and we

158
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,720
spend a lot of time

159
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,639
uh focusing on

160
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,160
are we secure in everything that we do

161
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,560
and we're spending more money on it

162
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,759
and

163
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,639
we thought that in 2020 that we were

164
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,160
going to be

165
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,160
going to be a target for hacks but it

166
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,720
turns out that what the biggest problem

167
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,280
that we have right now is disinformation

168
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,479
in elections

169
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,319
and uh we see

170
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,360
can see

171
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,240
that that is uh equally

172
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,960
as big of a problem as anyone hacking

173
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,680
into anything because now everyone's an

174
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,400
expert on elections and on what we do

175
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,600
and

176
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,639
they think they are and they approach it

177
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,039
approach us

178
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,319
me and my 98 fellow auditors from that

179
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,000
perspective that they know more about it

180
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,120
than we do

181
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,160
uh because they've read something that

182
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,160
somebody's doing and they want to know

183
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,240
if we're doing the same thing or what we

184
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,120
did

185
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,520
differently so we're really under the

186
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,000
microscope i always knew we were

187
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,479
what we really are now in this present

188
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,719
day

189
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,160
thank you

190
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,120
we'll see health care uh some different

191
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,360
differences with health care that

192
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,639
you know you might not have with some of

193
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,759
the other

194
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,000
other organizations

195
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,840
number one and foremost in healthcare

196
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,240
we're there to provide a service to our

197
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,360
patients right so our job is to meet

198
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,599
regulatory requirements and ensure that

199
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,080
the information availability is there to

200
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,199
provide that patient care

201
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,960
that's one one piece of that hipaa

202
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,720
regulation that you know we were

203
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,479
required to follow

204
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,240
so that kind of drives a lot of our

205
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,160
direction um and some of the

206
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,800
requirements and then how we turn

207
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,960
hipaa to provide those services and make

208
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,319
sure that they're secure as they can

209
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,840
possibly be

210
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,160
outside of those things

211
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,520
some other things that are different

212
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,280
healthcare

213
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,160
from my previous jobs is biomedical

214
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,319
equipment you know that that brings in a

215
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,599
whole new risk just by the nature of how

216
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,120
medical equipment makes it into your

217
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,800
organization

218
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,440
for instance you know we have policies

219
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,199
and procedures for vendors to come on

220
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,000
site to try out new biomed equipment

221
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,960
so we have to be aware of things that

222
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,639
might be connected to our network and

223
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,000
make sure that we're allowing that to

224
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,639
happen in a secure manner while we're

225
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,319
you know doing security reviews for

226
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,080
those pieces of equipment to make sure

227
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,400
that they do maintain hipaa compliance

228
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,360
so that

229
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,280
we're protecting not only our patients

230
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,159
health and our patients information

231
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,159
okay so i'm gonna skip ahead a little

232
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,440
bit um

233
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,440
let's get a fun one in here

234
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,559
uh and i

235
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,240
admitted like i won these guys ahead of

236
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,240
time i was gonna ask this question so

237
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,800
we'll call chatham house rules here

238
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,720
we're all friends none of this could be

239
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,279
public or end up in the press

240
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,800
right

241
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,360
yeah so um yeah and it's being rewarding

242
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,800
so um how about a war story so can you

243
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,600
tell a story about an attack or an

244
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,360
incident does it necessarily have to be

245
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,279
a breach right

246
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,360
um it doesn't have to be reportable

247
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,440
what's one time when

248
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,040
either the hair stood up on the back

249
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,600
your neck or it was kind of all hands on

250
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,880
deck and

251
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,040
can you share with these guys what that

252
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,880
experience was like what you sort of

253
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,360
went through

254
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,839
yeah

255
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,880
um not your funnest day right um from

256
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,399
that perspective so the one i'll share

257
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,320
with you guys um

258
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,560
uh probably fairly

259
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,880
uh common you know four or five years

260
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,880
ago and uh

261
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,279
this one went to an office that's

262
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,040
responsible for payroll i'm not going to

263
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,279
say which office that is but anybody who

264
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,040
works in an organization can figure that

265
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,640
out

266
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,600
and

267
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,480
it

268
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,839
came to

269
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,080
one of our folks that was inexperienced

270
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,640
with actually processing payroll and

271
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,800
kind of a newer employee and it came

272
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,560
from our president

273
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,040
and it was very kind of

274
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,680
informal and chit chatty which was very

275
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,200
interesting because that's how our

276
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,839
former president was

277
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,560
and it said uh hey i need

278
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,040
to get some information out

279
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,360
immediately to the state i'm at a

280
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,120
conference right now

281
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,120
and i need all of uh everyone's personal

282
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,000
information including their salaries and

283
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,120
ssns and things of that nature

284
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,680
so this person was you know dutifully

285
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,720
doing what the president asked her to do

286
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,360
i shouldn't what the president asked

287
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,160
them to do and

288
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,040
uh

289
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,839
at that at that point um

290
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,160
they were smart enough to ask one of

291
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,600
their peers

292
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,440
how do i transmit this this is going to

293
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,680
be a really big file and one of their

294
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,800
peers said

295
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,279
what are you talking about

296
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,600
why would you ever transmit something

297
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,720
like that

298
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,440
and you know so they got to the bottom

299
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,640
of the story

300
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,120
found out you know that this was coming

301
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,959
from our president

302
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,920
looked a little bit more at the uh

303
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,920
at the email looked underneath it of

304
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,279
course it wasn't coming from our

305
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,120
president it was coming from someone

306
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,279
impersonating the president

307
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,399
so they did

308
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,040
shut that down and we had some really

309
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,399
good training

310
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,320
for folks after that

311
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,120
particularly for those that

312
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,920
we called our vips so that's anybody in

313
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,640
finance that can mess around with money

314
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,480
anybody at hr that can mess around with

315
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,519
money anybody obviously in i.t

316
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,600
you know special access that type of

317
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,200
thing so

318
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,640
they get extra training all of them

319
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,600
and that was that was something that uh

320
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,120
was an eye-opener thank goodness it

321
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,000
didn't result in any harm uh

322
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,519
to us uh

323
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,880
um but

324
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,320
you know definitely one of those things

325
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,839
that oh my gosh i'm glad

326
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,399
you know i don't know am i glad that

327
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,880
this happened yeah i i guess so i'm glad

328
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,120
that it didn't you know turn out to be

329
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,120
anything but it was it was a great

330
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,720
experience and it was something that

331
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,480
kind of showed us

332
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,519
um

333
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,360
you know i'll get into this later i

334
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,519
think too but um it's uh

335
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,399
how important having those people uh

336
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,920
that you work with

337
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,959
um

338
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,760
have good knowledge of systems and

339
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,160
security so that was i guess our story

340
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,279
again

341
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,600
had a happy ending uh maybe not so much

342
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,680
for the the person that

343
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,320
um you know almost uh spilled the beans

344
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,200
but

345
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,399
yeah

346
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,639
it definitely was something that was an

347
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,070
eye-opener for us

348
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:50,509
[Music]

349
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,000
one of the functions that

350
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,920
the auditor's office does is accounts

351
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,480
payable we are the county department for

352
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,480
the for the county we have about 800

353
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,200
employees so one of the things we

354
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,120
encounter is

355
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,279
that

356
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,600
like most companies we do direct deposit

357
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,160
so we have payroll authorizations we

358
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,800
have people giving us their their direct

359
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,639
deposit slips and

360
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,200
wanting to change bank accounts and most

361
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,279
of those are legitimate but we get

362
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,760
illegitimate ones as well and thankfully

363
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,320
we've caught all the the bad ones that

364
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,839
originate

365
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,320
from who knows where trying to get us to

366
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,279
change to a bank account of somebody

367
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,800
that doesn't work there

368
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,680
uh

369
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,040
on elections as i uh illustrated

370
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,639
before

371
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,199
the the disinformation

372
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,160
is

373
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,000
really the problem we have now

374
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,240
now if you're following election news

375
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,800
and what's going on in maricopa county

376
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,079
arizona

377
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,079
um the the

378
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,000
the word of the day is forensic

379
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,839
forensic audits

380
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,760
uh we're getting requests and i just got

381
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,639
one this week we would like to we

382
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,720
noticed some anomalies on the secretary

383
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,360
of state's website and we would like to

384
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,760
investigate that and

385
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,959
conduct a forensic audit of this data

386
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,120
now they weren't explicit as to what the

387
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,680
data was they didn't

388
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,600
define it very well

389
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,160
but in tracing back this

390
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,800
potential person it looks like this

391
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,800
person may be involved in some lawsuits

392
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,040
of some sort

393
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,880
we don't have a definition of what a

394
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,000
forensic audit of alexis is in the state

395
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,399
of iowa you may have in your mind what

396
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,440
forensic means but that doesn't mean

397
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,360
it's what i think it means

398
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,000
and we do a post-election audit after

399
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,399
every election now anyway

400
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,279
so we would have to write a new law that

401
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,959
says we're going to do forensic audits

402
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:55,760
and

403
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,519
everyone would have

404
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,120
would have to agree upon what that

405
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,480
really is

406
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,480
along with uh election officials

407
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,440
all right um

408
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,399
i hate to sing the same tune here this

409
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,240
question is you know can be kind of

410
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,920
sensitive so

411
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,120
the fact that we're on camera and

412
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,240
everything like that is probably going

413
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,959
to change my uh answer here a little bit

414
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,959
so i want to talk about an instance that

415
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,480
we had

416
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,680
that kind of speaks to security controls

417
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,000
and the fact that when you

418
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,920
put out security controls or create

419
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,240
security controls um you need to have

420
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,560
more than one right because yes one

421
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,800
single point failure

422
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,800
odds are at some point that's going to

423
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,040
fail for you so we had a similar

424
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,639
instance where

425
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,399
one of our vips was targeted with a

426
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,880
phishing scam and so this started it

427
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,279
went to payroll it went to hr it was

428
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,040
coming from you know one of the top guys

429
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,279
in the organization so

430
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,519
anytime that happens you know you

431
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,279
receive that you want to be very helpful

432
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,480
right

433
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,120
so they kind of dropped the processes

434
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,959
that they should have been following

435
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,880
which is to follow up have them actually

436
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,120
come fill out paperwork to change your

437
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,240
uh

438
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,600
your payroll

439
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,240
so they bypassed that now luckily we had

440
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,279
an additional control um with the vendor

441
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,759
company that does our payroll and

442
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,600
they were able to before they make a

443
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,839
change their process was they had to

444
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,560
call and speak to that vip personally

445
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,720
well they did that and obviously you

446
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,240
know i get the phone call what is going

447
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,759
on here

448
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,079
so they caught it they didn't do it but

449
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,480
it speaks to those controls

450
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,639
outside of that

451
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,320
you know that was a very good learning

452
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,800
lesson for everyone internally

453
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,639
because everyone at that point

454
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,560
understood why those processes were in

455
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,040
place why they were important and you

456
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,880
know why security's always telling you

457
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,880
to follow those processes

458
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,000
and the importance and

459
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,480
it's been super beneficial because this

460
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,480
year last year i guess we started

461
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,639
receiving and we're not the only people

462
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,880
in the state of iowa but

463
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,119
a scam around

464
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,760
unemployment right so

465
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,319
we hr receives that scam that says hey

466
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,919
we got this unemployment benefit for

467
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,559
so-and-so

468
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,559
this time they followed the processes

469
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,559
and they realized very quickly that this

470
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,559
was a scam these people still work for

471
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,760
us um so obviously not it we spoke to

472
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,919
you know the state um investigators

473
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,000
about it and they assured us you know

474
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
that this information isn't coming from

475
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
you uh you know they told us where they

476
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,280
thought it was coming from and it's

477
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,679
impacting organizations all over iowa so

478
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,679
i'd be shocked if people in this room

479
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,280
probably haven't heard about that that

480
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,440
scam that's happening but it is still

481
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,679
happening we still see those trickling

482
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,520
in we're probably down to a couple

483
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,919
months now

484
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,039
but yeah

485
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,880
i can't stress enough having those

486
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,880
controls in place and more than one

487
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,679
control um

488
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,160
yeah i'll just tag

489
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,400
um one sec i'll just tag on to that a

490
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,760
little bit um sometimes those simple or

491
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,080
kind of uh you know 2d

492
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,640
solutions for the controls are as

493
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,720
important as the really elaborate ones

494
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,640
so having that extra

495
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,320
call-in check and that's actually one of

496
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,320
the things we have for making payroll

497
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,000
cheese too

498
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,720
is really good

499
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,440
oh do you have a question

500
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,790
top three in the country in terms of

501
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:39,869
[Music]

502
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,840
yeah it's interesting when you when you

503
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,520
look on the dark web

504
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,840
you uh we have clients that

505
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,840
will ask us occasionally if there's a

506
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,160
if there's a credit card breach

507
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,160
they'll ask us to go poke around and see

508
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,640
what we can find and

509
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,160
personal identity

510
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,919
especially if it's relatively fresh

511
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,280
those go for i don't know five bucks 15

512
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,440
bucks a pop give or take

513
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,679
medical id so if you get a copy of

514
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,400
somebody's medical record from an ehr

515
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,360
system

516
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,400
uh those can go for between 150 and 300

517
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,039
a pop and what a lot of the bad guys

518
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,960
will do is use that they'll go get a

519
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,960
prescription at like six or seven

520
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,720
different shady pharmacies for oxycodone

521
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,880
and then they get somebody to go in and

522
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,880
pick up the 90 pills a week and they

523
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,640
sell each of those pills

524
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,640
to some poor

525
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,679
person

526
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,200
who

527
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,360
is addicted to opioids for a hundred

528
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,720
bucks a pop

529
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,520
and

530
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,960
yeah that's where that's where a lot of

531
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,080
those identities end up

532
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,440
work here

533
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:10,109
[Music]

534
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
is

535
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,880
my guess would be that they didn't

536
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,039
finish the second half of the project

537
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,640
where they redirect

538
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,960
those funds to their own account they

539
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,039
didn't get that far they got you got the

540
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,960
first part of the job done what do you

541
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,120
guys think

542
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,080
yeah

543
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,840
they got halfway there

544
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,679
you know

545
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,760
one of them's gonna go out and do maybe

546
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,600
the the first part that we talked about

547
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,559
another one is set up to have all the

548
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,799
wire transfers or you know

549
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,960
like a box credit card you know

550
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,400
something like that they've got all

551
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,880
those things lined up so i would agree i

552
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,440
think with the consensus there but yeah

553
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,039
certainly in your position i would

554
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,559
wonder too i'm like

555
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,320
the heck did they even do that you know

556
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,640
take that risk if it's not going to die

557
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,039
but that would make sense

558
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,080
just like

559
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,080
you know any organization has

560
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,520
specialists

561
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,039
they do too it's and it's scary i mean i

562
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,360
always you know

563
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,280
back before all this stuff became very

564
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,120
prevalent would i always think oh it's

565
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,559
like one person sitting in your

566
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,240
yeah that's he said to his buddy like

567
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,320
who are you well i'm the guy who does my

568
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,600
job

569
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,159
who didn't do your job we've seen that

570
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,840
too where they've divided some

571
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,760
especially the russians

572
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,919
those cartels have gotten complex enough

573
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,919
that they actually divide the labor ups

574
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,640
you have your negotiations guy you you

575
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,760
have your

576
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,280
what like the transfer the guy who

577
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,799
handles the money and then you've got

578
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,120
the actual hacker that introduces the

579
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,159
malware in some cases you'll see in some

580
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,679
of the irs incident responses we do

581
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,360
one of the first steps is to figure out

582
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,679
who else has been invited to the party

583
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,679
because what they'll do is take down

584
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,520
like

585
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,320
a school or a bank or a government or a

586
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,799
hospital and they'll use it for what

587
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,000
they're going to do and when they're

588
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,360
done

589
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,360
they'll go sell the keys to somebody

590
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,679
else and say hey i've got you know

591
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,200
access to a bank

592
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,280
10 grand and i'll sell you the login and

593
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,760
password and all the ips that you need

594
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,000
so sometimes in an incident you have to

595
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,600
figure out like you may have two or

596
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,840
three people invited to the party that

597
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,440
makes things quite a bit more

598
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,159
complicated

599
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,799
you would probably know what's better

600
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,159
than me it was supposedly in the case of

601
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,280
branson where they actually have a

602
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,159
customer service department as well

603
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,360
to to to ensure that they can uh handle

604
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,280
the transactions and

605
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,480
get the end result they want

606
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,880
they yeah they're multiple languages all

607
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,520
kinds of stuff they have call centers in

608
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,520
india that'll do just about

609
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,760
they'll read any foot book that you send

610
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,679
to them

611
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:36,799
so

612
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,960
you know i wanted to try and do this

613
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,200
panel in a way that wasn't like let's

614
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,880
regurgitate the

615
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,720
same stuff that you saw in the new york

616
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,200
times or the verizon breach report

617
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,880
weekend so what

618
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,400
i'd like to talk about what's a little

619
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,919
bit different

620
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,320
right um because if you're everybody

621
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,919
who's sitting here like you're at a

622
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,520
hacker conference somehow you've

623
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,360
probably figured out that this is kind

624
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,360
of the thing um

625
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,480
so what what would you say uh that

626
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,880
people get wrong about what you do like

627
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,720
what are some of the misconceptions

628
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,760
about

629
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,880
the the

630
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,320
jobs that you have like what did you

631
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,120
what do you wish people knew

632
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,320
about what

633
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,120
your work and security looks like other

634
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,320
than it's not like ncis wait a minute

635
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,799
i'm almost took a firework okay i'm in

636
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,240
like the

637
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,640
cool hollywood stuff what what's the

638
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,799
thing that you kind of wish people knew

639
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,039
about the security aspect of your your

640
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,640
job or a common misconception

641
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,120
yeah that's a really good question um

642
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,360
and this would even go back to kind of

643
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,600
my mindset before kind of knowing more

644
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,640
about it and i'm an enthusiastic learner

645
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,120
of cyber security by no means am i an

646
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,880
expert so i feel a little bit

647
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,000
unqualified up here um but uh so i'll

648
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,080
just i'll leave that

649
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,200
from that standpoint but i think

650
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,679
the thing that i've learned the most you

651
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:02,480
know

652
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,120
about it that i think people

653
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,159
may think it's different is it's not all

654
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,480
about the infrastructure side i mean

655
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,400
certainly you want to have a good strong

656
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,279
infrastructure but a lot of it is

657
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,159
about

658
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,159
the people that you work with and their

659
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,480
knowledge and their ability

660
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,760
to spot things that aren't right spot

661
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,840
things that you know

662
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,520
may be an issue

663
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,559
and then

664
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,799
come up with kind of on their own or

665
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,960
with help asking a neighbor

666
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,559
a friend by them

667
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,360
hey

668
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,559
does that look right to me is are you

669
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,919
kind of looking at this the way i'm

670
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,640
looking at it so that skepticism i think

671
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,480
is something that

672
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,520
us

673
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,400
kind of midwestern illinois iowa nice

674
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,440
people

675
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,200
don't have a lot of that we need more of

676
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,200
you know

677
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,559
probably the things that we were talking

678
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,240
about before

679
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,520
would have happened maybe as easily um

680
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,960
gotten to the point that they did

681
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,960
certainly uh none of them were

682
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,760
catastrophes but if you're in new york

683
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,360
i mean those people like

684
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,840
i'm not switching you know the score yet

685
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,840
you know give me some information write

686
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,080
it down on a piece of paper but the iowa

687
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,000
nice people are like oh geez that's my

688
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,559
boss's boss and i need to you know kick

689
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:21,440
in and

690
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,039
pay attention to this and take care of

691
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:27,320
it so um i i think i definitely had

692
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,760
underestimated um

693
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,240
the power of kind of getting everybody

694
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,919
uh trained up

695
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,960
getting them all to a certain level of

696
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,400
you know kind of what's going on out

697
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,440
there maybe not being you know an expert

698
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,480
but

699
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,360
being smart enough about

700
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,840
what they're doing on a daily basis

701
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,360
you know with

702
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,440
their network credentials with their

703
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,640
email with

704
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,840
you know the things that they're

705
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,279
responsible for um

706
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,679
and i think without that it's a lot more

707
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:00,960
dangerous

708
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,799
you know if

709
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,240
a lot of the folks that we support until

710
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,480
we kind of engage with them so somebody

711
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,559
new coming from somewhere else thinks oh

712
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,360
i t you guys got this

713
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,159
oh no my friend we have this cyber

714
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,159
security thing and you're going to help

715
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:18,880
us

716
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,640
because you're going to be out there

717
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,039
kind of scanning and patrolling and

718
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,520
paying attention to stuff and letting us

719
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,679
know i mean that's one of the one of the

720
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,880
ways that we get stronger is we have all

721
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,799
the things that get reported you know

722
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,600
come into a central dispatch and we get

723
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,279
to look at those trends we get to find

724
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,440
out what's going on we get to you know

725
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,399
investigate that ticket and close it um

726
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,120
but

727
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,720
so if somebody was just kind of out

728
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,120
there going oh you know i t stuff will

729
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,640
take care of this

730
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,159
not so much

731
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,840
there's got to be there's got to be that

732
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,440
collaboration there's got to be

733
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,000
understanding and there's got to be

734
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,600
somebody with kind of an inquisitive

735
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,720
mindset

736
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,200
as an employee to be able to

737
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,440
to kind of help us in that so that's

738
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,159
kind of what i've got

739
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,440
well as i said

740
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,640
election security control

741
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,240
a few a few

742
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,720
if you strip away my title and

743
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,600
everything uh what it comes down to is

744
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,679
that uh

745
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,840
me and people like me throughout iowa

746
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,360
throughout illinois or throughout the

747
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,200
nation

748
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,760
we're administrators of american

749
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,440
democracy

750
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,240
we

751
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,320
do our jobs

752
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,840
to ensure

753
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,880
that

754
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,880
the supporters

755
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,520
of the loser accept the results of the

756
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:43,840
election

757
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,600
[Music]

758
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,080
we just want to do a good job

759
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,840
we want to be the referees of the

760
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,440
football game that you don't pay

761
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,080
attention to because they made all good

762
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,039
calls and nobody notices them that's how

763
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,799
we used to be

764
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,240
and we did our jobs and we were secure

765
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,880
but as i said in 2016 we

766
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,159
we found out probably in 2017 that

767
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,000
people tried to hack into

768
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,399
election systems in illinois and other

769
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:13,440
places

770
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,600
so we got ready for the election in

771
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,080
2018. you know we heightened our

772
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,080
awareness and tried to

773
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,799
look at every vulnerability we had

774
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:27,600
we did the same in 2020 uh and got ready

775
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,480
and

776
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,399
to my knowledge there were no breaches

777
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,240
that occurred

778
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,480
but as i said the the disinformation in

779
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,799
the campaign took over

780
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,240
and what i think that people don't

781
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,520
realize and just need to be reminded of

782
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,080
is that the people running elections

783
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,600
my office um i have 160 000 residents

784
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,240
and 106 000 voters in lincoln county

785
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,840
we're the second largest

786
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,679
polk counties of 320 000 voters

787
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,960
my permanent staff is five people

788
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,000
we don't win the election

789
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,240
we have to go out and hire up to 600

790
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,960
people to run the election on election

791
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,279
day those are democrats republicans

792
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,679
libertarian greens and nobody people

793
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,000
those are our neighbors

794
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,919
uh from from each of the precincts that

795
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,559
we have in county every county in iowa

796
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,559
is the same way we hire people your

797
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,559
friends your neighbors and in fact if

798
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,799
you wanted to be a part of that i'm sure

799
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,399
you could go to your county auditor or

800
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:27,919
your election administrator or wherever

801
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,919
you're at and volunteer to work on

802
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,080
election day you have some doubts as to

803
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,440
what

804
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,720
goes into

805
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,640
keeping elections secure and running

806
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,039
that election and they would welcome

807
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,720
that help because there's a shortage if

808
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,080
you haven't noticed when you go in to

809
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,960
vote most everybody has 60 plus years of

810
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,000
age i like to say that they're

811
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,799
chronologically gifted but they're doing

812
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,320
it because they feel a patriotic duty to

813
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,960
work that election so elections are not

814
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,000
run by some russian cartel they're run

815
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,159
by your neighbors

816
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,519
and

817
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:04,320
we did have at one time a lot of trust

818
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,760
in the process

819
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,320
and the disinformation has destroyed the

820
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,360
trust

821
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,480
and is destroying our democracy

822
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,279
and i'm here to counter that

823
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,080
i'm here every step of every day trying

824
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,880
to counter that disinformation and it

825
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,039
requires us to be

826
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,799
our antidote to that i believe is

827
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,880
transparency

828
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,960
government is supposed to be transparent

829
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,200
elections are supposed to be transparent

830
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,360
i try to make my office as transparent

831
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,720
as possible i want you to know

832
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,720
everything about it that's why we have

833
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,559
public tests of our voting machines

834
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,600
that's why we have observers

835
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,240
we want to increase the trust

836
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,720
and remove the disinformation that that

837
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,880
surrounding us now that is not founded

838
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,000
on fact

839
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,279
but is founded upon somebody decided to

840
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,760
make up a lie

841
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,480
and people are buying into it and that's

842
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,679
a problem of course paul

843
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,519
yes sir i totally agree um i find it

844
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,200
interesting

845
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,799
that you're hacked in a different sort

846
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,480
of way instead of your systems being

847
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,440
happy

848
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,480
a lot as i mentioned is that the same

849
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,519
foreign

850
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,080
adversaries that have

851
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,240
education and healthcare

852
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,640
started a lot of this information that

853
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,240
has sort of hacked the minds of my

854
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,159
friends and neighbors and caused you a

855
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:27,600
problem it's a different form of

856
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,279
attacking it's a different form of

857
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,679
cybersecurity we're not used to it

858
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,840
and we're not we're not used to it we i

859
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,399
mean people you know grew up in eastern

860
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:37,279
europe

861
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:40,080
they're not used

862
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,159
we haven't lived that life but a lot of

863
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,159
that is the exact same mortgages

864
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,799
so the comment wasn't i don't know that

865
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,480
cameron picked that up that

866
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,799
yes the social media and the information

867
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:53,679
and

868
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,200
the people that were focused on

869
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,679
happiness electronically are now hacking

870
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,760
us via the the media

871
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,240
and uh putting out that information yes

872
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,240
that's that's our that's our threat now

873
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,760
but that can flip you know they can

874
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,960
pivot in two years and in 2022

875
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,120
you know they'll they'll go from yes

876
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,799
they're doing the disinformation but now

877
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,600
they're also attacking our systems or

878
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,600
and and trying to find that one here

879
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,679
that somebody you know came in and

880
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,120
reached a voting machine it's probably

881
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,519
only a couple thousand in iowa and you

882
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,200
know and that's going to make the news

883
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,960
you know they've reached it just like

884
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,840
the

885
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,760
comments made about the different voting

886
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,039
machine manufacturers i mean

887
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,760
it's out there it's very harmful

888
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,799
and we use paper ballots in iowa and so

889
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,399
as people say it's really hard to hack

890
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:41,360
people

891
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,559
um

892
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,640
so i'll pass along just like i do on a

893
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,200
long time about this thank you

894
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,880
thank you

895
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,120
so i have two answers for this question

896
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,440
i wanted to be health care specific but

897
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,360
the other ones um i think

898
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,279
it's more of a general statement but

899
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,600
it's i think one of the most important

900
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,840
um so anytime we have an entire class

901
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,519
that starts you know i go down and i

902
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,440
speak to the entire class the one thing

903
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,600
that i tell them is that we have a lot

904
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,159
of great security tools that we're using

905
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,639
to help protect our patients and you but

906
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,480
the best tool that we have

907
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,560
is sitting right in front of me security

908
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,320
awareness

909
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,599
what you guys are going to bring to the

910
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,560
table

911
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,079
i don't have any tools that can beat

912
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,040
that

913
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,399
and the reason that that is is our

914
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,560
number our two biggest attack vectors

915
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,839
right phishing emails and surfing the

916
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,839
internet right a lot of bad things can

917
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,239
happen doing those things so we have a

918
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,839
lot of tools that we don't protect we

919
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,679
can't protect against everything and

920
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,520
plus you have to go home too right you

921
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,440
have to internet in the house so

922
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,960
everything that you're going to learn

923
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,399
that we're going to teach you to

924
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,000
increase your security awareness is not

925
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,599
only going to benefit us and our

926
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,719
patients but also yourself so

927
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:53,599
i think that has to be said uh i truly

928
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,359
believe that's that's one of the biggest

929
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,119
security things that we have

930
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:57,839
now

931
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,240
healthcare specific answer

932
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,960
you know i want people to know um how

933
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,240
much work goes into protecting your phi

934
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,680
right that's the most important data

935
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,000
that we have at the hospital phi is

936
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,839
personal healthcare information right

937
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,280
protected healthcare information is

938
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,680
personal healthcare information

939
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,000
so we spend a lot and that's that's why

940
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,400
you have the hipaa rule right um because

941
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,079
the government wants to make sure that

942
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,000
we're doing that now the hypno rule

943
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,079
while it's great in its entirety it

944
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,560
doesn't tell you what to do right

945
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,720
you have to interpret interpret what you

946
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,040
think that it needs you to do right now

947
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,119
luckily we have other frameworks that we

948
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:37,119
apply that on top of to get to the

949
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,880
security that we need like in this cyber

950
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,359
security framework for instance um so i

951
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,200
think it's very important that people

952
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,320
realize that and

953
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,079
effective july 1st 2021

954
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,800
the inoperability act was rolled out

955
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,520
what that is is that's

956
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,880
the basis of that is that healthcare has

957
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,359
to make your personal information

958
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,240
um very available to you so what i mean

959
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,000
by that and maybe some of you have

960
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
already seen this maybe you sit in the

961
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
hospital room and you have my chart

962
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,160
right you just took a test you're

963
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,079
waiting for the doctor to come in and

964
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,160
tell you the results of that test if you

965
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,160
log into my chart now you're going to

966
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,839
know the results before that nurse walks

967
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:20,560
in

968
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,480
right that's created some heartache for

969
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,960
the nurses and the doctors because you

970
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,640
know maybe it's information that they

971
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,640
want to provide to you in a

972
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,960
particular way because you know the

973
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,960
impact it might have on you so that's

974
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,359
one impact but the other impact is is

975
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,040
that we have to provide

976
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,640
your information we have to provide it

977
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,480
to you when you want it right so if you

978
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,400
want to have your health after care

979
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,040
information come through our

980
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,800
apple health care act or something like

981
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,599
that

982
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,480
you know

983
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,320
the one thing that the act doesn't tell

984
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,800
you is that hipaa doesn't apply across

985
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,960
the board right so just because the

986
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,520
healthcare agency is responsible for

987
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,440
providing all the hipaa security that

988
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,119
app might not be under the same

989
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,200
regulatory requirements so they might

990
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,480
not be providing the same protection so

991
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,040
if there's one thing that i think people

992
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,359
misunderstand especially when it comes

993
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,520
to sharing information or providing

994
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,480
access

995
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,839
is that

996
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,359
just because you have access to do

997
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:18,320
something

998
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,240
with your information you might be

999
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,040
changing actual

1000
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,800
the security of personal information so

1001
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,400
that those would be the two things that

1002
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,119
i would talk about

1003
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,119
i'll ask one more question

1004
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,720
3 45

1005
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,520
and then maybe

1006
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,119
any questions

1007
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,040
in here

1008
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,240
what are your

1009
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,359
priorities so when you look in let's say

1010
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,280
the next three years or so when you

1011
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,400
think about

1012
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,880
where cyber security is going and how

1013
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,200
things are changing over over time and

1014
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,240
kind of what

1015
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,320
what you think i mean to the degree any

1016
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,640
of us know what tomorrow holds

1017
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,760
but

1018
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,520
what are what are the

1019
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,200
uh what are your priorities when it

1020
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,480
comes to

1021
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,280
security um in the in the coming years

1022
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,640
in the next let's say the next three

1023
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,640
years what's up what's kind of top of

1024
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,200
mind for you guys in terms of

1025
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,880
what things you're going to change or

1026
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,079
introduce

1027
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,760
to to deal with

1028
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,119
the threats you see coming

1029
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,400
yeah that's a big one um because things

1030
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,400
come at us so so quickly but i see

1031
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,119
brandon back there and um he's told us

1032
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,760
this for a year and we definitely pay

1033
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,680
attention to brandon he's our

1034
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,640
ciso for our college and does a great

1035
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,520
job for us um but one is two factor for

1036
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,720
everything

1037
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,000
so people are very used to that now

1038
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,960
we do have that in lots of situations

1039
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,880
but not everything so when i say

1040
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,119
everything i mean everything and talk

1041
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,920
about apps that students use apps that

1042
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,720
adjunct faculty use and talking about

1043
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,680
all of those things so it's a it's a

1044
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,320
bigger ask particularly for higher ed

1045
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,240
than it would be for somebody that's

1046
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,560
getting a paycheck from a company

1047
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,880
because these students are kind of like

1048
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,680
why is kirkwood asking me to do

1049
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,480
two-factor you know that seems weird but

1050
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,720
we have a pretty good answer it's going

1051
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,640
to help you become more secure it's

1052
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,680
going to help us be more secure so

1053
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,480
but uh you know it's it's less

1054
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,200
convenient but sometimes security is

1055
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,680
you know the antonym for uh convenience

1056
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,079
from that standpoint you just have to

1057
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,359
kind of work that way um

1058
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,200
trying to think of something another

1059
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,720
thing that we've got

1060
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,440
we're kind of re-bolstering

1061
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,599
our backups as well as our disaster

1062
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,839
recovery process

1063
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:00,720
so

1064
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,119
when you think about a ratio coming

1065
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,960
through and

1066
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,960
hitting very close to your primary data

1067
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,280
center

1068
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,440
that kind of gets things amped up around

1069
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,800
that so

1070
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,520
the president said here's some money go

1071
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,599
make this happen because you know we've

1072
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:18,880
talked about it

1073
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,560
uh since she's been there for three

1074
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,599
years and very big supporter around that

1075
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,480
but we've always had other priorities

1076
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,160
this uh

1077
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,440
sometimes

1078
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,079
well i i got a proper data center

1079
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,760
because of an ice storm

1080
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,000
about 14 years ago

1081
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,960
that took out all the electricity for

1082
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,560
lynn county and some of the surrounding

1083
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,040
counties for about four days and thank

1084
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,440
goodness it wasn't around a time when

1085
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,760
it's a peak enrollment because i i

1086
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,520
monetized it and i shared it with our

1087
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,359
president's cabinet and said this is

1088
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,119
what would have happened if you know

1089
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,520
even 10 of the people who were going to

1090
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,280
enroll couldn't have enrolled during

1091
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,119
that time frame and it was you know

1092
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,000
millions of dollars so um have a little

1093
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,599
ounce of protection

1094
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,920
uh worth that pound of cure is pretty

1095
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,760
important from that standpoint and i

1096
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,359
would say the last one it's a little bit

1097
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:10,800
of a cop out

1098
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,560
because i don't know what i don't know

1099
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,440
about this but it's to stay open and

1100
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,680
stay flexible

1101
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,839
i think that's a that's something that

1102
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:23,200
really has served uh us well uh to this

1103
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,839
point is really staying open-minded uh

1104
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,000
staying flexible to things that are

1105
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,720
presenting themselves out there um

1106
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,000
and

1107
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,599
you know once once we see something

1108
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,240
that's going to really make a difference

1109
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,560
to execute on it and

1110
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,240
we've got a pretty good track record of

1111
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,800
being able to get money

1112
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,370
because we can make a good case

1113
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:48,000
[Music]

1114
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,599
of my peers not so much i mean um it's

1115
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,680
it's difficult uh we we compete

1116
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,680
really with um

1117
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,480
making education potentially better you

1118
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,400
know for our students

1119
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,680
with that money

1120
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,880
but the way i kind of spend it is um

1121
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,200
look if we have a big breach or we have

1122
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,720
something that's uh taking time away

1123
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,319
then your students aren't going to learn

1124
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,200
like for a couple weeks go ask dmacc and

1125
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,760
sorry mark i love you but uh

1126
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,319
you know that that was a challenge for

1127
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,160
him and a challenge for

1128
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,000
um for that community college and uh for

1129
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,640
us to be down for two weeks during like

1130
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,319
peak time

1131
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,119
i'd

1132
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,480
be updating the resume

1133
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,319
doing other things

1134
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,160
maybe i just hit the checkout button at

1135
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,920
that point because

1136
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,599
that uh that would be very very

1137
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:44,400
difficult

1138
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,520
for anybody but um you know certainly uh

1139
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,599
it wouldn't be something we would wanna

1140
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,440
we would wanna entertain so we're trying

1141
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,280
to stay one step ahead doing the best

1142
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,839
that we can

1143
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,880
well i would categorize this as a circle

1144
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,119
of control maybe a very servant control

1145
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,599
influence concern and i've added a

1146
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,920
fourth one noise but circle control what

1147
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,960
do i control as a county auditor uh

1148
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,119
speak the truth to the lives make us as

1149
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,440
transparent as possible uh try to be as

1150
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,160
responsive to the public as possible to

1151
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,599
answer the questions

1152
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,240
uh about elections and

1153
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,960
cyber security and so forth uh we have

1154
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,560
also

1155
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,560
my office has also partnered with our

1156
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,960
i.t i i don't have a separate i.t group

1157
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,960
i have a i.t group that takes care of

1158
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,880
our election equipment but i don't have

1159
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,280
uh i don't control i.t

1160
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,079
for the county of lynn but we do partner

1161
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:41,680
with them when we got

1162
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,760
we were able to get grant funds

1163
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,359
uh earlier

1164
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:46,480
last year

1165
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,520
um

1166
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,079
i i gave a lot of money to to the it

1167
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,079
department to uh to increase the

1168
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,280
security of the entire county system uh

1169
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,880
as a safeguard to

1170
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,000
and over

1171
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,480
you know to partner to also protect

1172
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,040
elections

1173
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:03,760
so

1174
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,599
other things that i could influence are

1175
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,599
you know try to help smaller counties

1176
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,760
there's 98 other counties

1177
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,000
try to help them some of those offices

1178
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,680
are three or four people in the smallest

1179
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,520
counties adams county is the smallest

1180
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,920
county in iowa 2800 voters

1181
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,920
but they still have a county auditor and

1182
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,160
they do the same functions as we do only

1183
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,480
with a staff of three

1184
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,000
or four people in that county but they

1185
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,040
have to do

1186
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,800
you know they have to be just as

1187
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,520
vigilant as we do in the larger counties

1188
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,920
where our it department for the county

1189
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,119
is 20 plus people in it so it makes a it

1190
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:38,560
makes a difference

1191
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,680
on the state

1192
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,440
level

1193
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,599
particularly in iowa and i have made

1194
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,200
this a public issue

1195
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,560
is that our

1196
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,240
voter registration and election

1197
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,960
administration system was created in

1198
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,440
2004. that's not to say

1199
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,520
that it is

1200
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,520
insecure

1201
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,520
but it's dated and there's probably

1202
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,240
technologies that exist today

1203
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,319
and so far that could be written today

1204
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:06,640
that is more security more secure than

1205
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,160
what was written and done in 2004

1206
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,560
so from a statewide basis i'll continue

1207
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,200
to lobby to ensure that that system

1208
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,839
which is centralized in iowa and is

1209
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:19,440
supposed to be centralized in every

1210
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,240
other state in the union

1211
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,720
but in iowa is as secure as possible

1212
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,280
because i rely upon that if that system

1213
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,960
is corrupted

1214
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,960
my voters are corrupted my my vote

1215
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,400
registration is corrupted so

1216
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,760
[Music]

1217
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,599
it's all about the weakest link in the

1218
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:36,720
chain

1219
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,040
and making that weakness link stronger

1220
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,240
and stronger and stronger

1221
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,240
thank you

1222
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,480
um two things jump out to me that we're

1223
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,839
going to spend time focusing on

1224
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:49,440
obviously it's a little good question

1225
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,800
because you know

1226
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,720
continuous improvement in all areas you

1227
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,240
know increasing domination is always

1228
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,520
going to help make it more secure and

1229
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,119
things like that

1230
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,760
but last year was a pretty difficult

1231
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,520
year a lot of things

1232
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,599
you know with coven and we saw a lot of

1233
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,839
staff moved to work from home

1234
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:07,680
we weren't a company that was expecting

1235
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,560
that

1236
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,800
so you know we met the challenge but

1237
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,119
that's something that

1238
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:14,240
you know when you ask people to start

1239
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,760
coming back into the office now you have

1240
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,720
to start rethinking things right so

1241
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,880
a lot of staff especially in i.t have

1242
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,280
the ability to work from home so do you

1243
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,760
make them come back in the office

1244
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,960
you know that's the decision that you

1245
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,880
have to make

1246
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,640
i think most companies are going to be

1247
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,800
forced to start supporting more work

1248
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,359
from home so i think as

1249
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,760
security especially at our hospital

1250
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,680
we're going to support that which means

1251
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,520
we have to start figuring out what's the

1252
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,000
best way we can secure those work from

1253
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,720
home staff still you know getting into

1254
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,960
our network and in the best and most

1255
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,880
secure possible way

1256
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,800
some of the threats you know that that

1257
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,680
that

1258
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,520
brings is you know what about the home

1259
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,680
network how is that secure

1260
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,040
you know i don't have any visibility

1261
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,880
into your network at your house

1262
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,839
um so those are things that i think that

1263
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,119
we're going to focus on and i don't

1264
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:06,960
think that's unique to health care i

1265
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,280
think everybody every company is

1266
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,920
probably going to have to focus on that

1267
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,960
and it might be something they haven't

1268
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,359
thought about but in the next five years

1269
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,440
it's definitely going to be a top of the

1270
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,400
list

1271
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,920
the second thing that i think is top of

1272
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,839
the list that we're gonna that

1273
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,559
personally we're focusing on because i

1274
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:27,040
think it's an area that

1275
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,079
we've seen

1276
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,720
really exasperated with the civil

1277
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,160
women's hack

1278
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,480
in microsoft right these are

1279
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,319
third parties that the majority of

1280
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,640
people use that have a lot of

1281
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,720
high level credentials already in your

1282
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,280
network solar winds was

1283
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,000
you know pretty scary stuff

1284
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:46,960
but

1285
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,480
how are you going to handle that so

1286
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,720
supply chain management you know it's

1287
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,319
that's something i think organizations

1288
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,000
haven't focused on

1289
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,280
so how are you going to increase your

1290
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,280
security around supply chain management

1291
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,839
and we're looking at actually creating a

1292
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:02,720
new role whose job is to manage supply

1293
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,960
chain management and so what that means

1294
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,240
is are we doing the security uh reviews

1295
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,920
up front when we're bringing a new

1296
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,559
vendor right that's super important and

1297
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,119
then secondly how are we managing their

1298
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:17,280
access how do we know when those vendors

1299
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,280
leave the organization and that we're

1300
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,599
cutting off access correctly there's a

1301
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,760
lot of tools out there that i know you

1302
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,079
can use to help you accomplish those

1303
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:27,839
things but a lot of companies probably

1304
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:29,839
don't have those in place

1305
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:32,000
you know because until last year

1306
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,480
with solarwind microsoft it wasn't again

1307
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,760
another thing that wasn't top of the

1308
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,079
list that i think has uh

1309
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:40,160
very quickly gotten us to gotten

1310
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,160
themselves to the top of the list so i

1311
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,680
think not only us but i think a lot of

1312
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,200
companies are going to start focusing on

1313
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,520
those two things

1314
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,760
well gentlemen thank you for your time

1315
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,920
today thanks for for coming out

1316
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,520
hopefully you're doing okay at the

1317
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,839
tables after this

1318
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:01,720
are there any questions from anybody in

1319
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,720
the room

1320
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,960
you know amazon would like to know and

1321
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,559
the dilemma is

1322
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,800
uh

1323
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,960
government agencies seem to operate as

1324
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,319
silos and if you guys could get your i.t

1325
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:32,880
groups together to put a shield around

1326
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,920
it to protect my information uh

1327
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,000
that would make me feel much more secure

1328
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,079
and i have access you know to the city

1329
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,240
council and the county people and the

1330
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,240
township people

1331
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,000
they listen to me and

1332
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,319
you know maybe not pass laws but they i

1333
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,640
can't understand what's happening and so

1334
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,480
in a way uh

1335
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,319
yes the cia is nice the federal

1336
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:56,319
government's nice but if you could all

1337
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:58,480
work together to be more productive with

1338
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,640
your citizens

1339
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,839
we may find that that is a

1340
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,760
good labor

1341
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,079
thank you

1342
