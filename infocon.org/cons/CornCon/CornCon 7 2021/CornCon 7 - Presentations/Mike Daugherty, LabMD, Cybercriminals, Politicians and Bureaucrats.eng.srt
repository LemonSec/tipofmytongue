1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,080
um

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,600
so i'm like dougherty not of the world

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,839
of technology and now the world of law

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,160
and but i've been sort of

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,760
parachuted in

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,920
on you know in the difference of what i

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,440
really wanted to do so here i am 13

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,960
years later how many people have heard

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,000
anything about live md or just ftc

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,080
someone else did okay so what i'm gonna

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,439
do uh

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,600
i mean ultimately my my core is i'm a

13
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,000
sales guy a consultative sales guy so we

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,760
always are taught to take seven

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,359
times to get the

16
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,760
impression or even notice and so i'm

17
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,040
going to tear you through really quickly

18
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,040
what i call the tunnel of fire what

19
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,440
happened and then the rear view mirror

20
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,280
because

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,360
i will just say in the beginning what we

22
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,039
thought happened all those years and

23
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,600
what what was not really going on and so

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,160
this is uh uh

25
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,360
and and why anyone should care

26
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,559
um

27
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:55,840
and it's something that's changed to

28
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,520
sort of my experience with audiences and

29
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,640
and

30
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,640
public perception of anything that goes

31
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,359
out of washington is that we um i'm not

32
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,559
the victim

33
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,119
uh the victim is the patients of my

34
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,040
company and everyone that's related to

35
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,479
any of those patients that were getting

36
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,280
diagnosed for cancer and what we don't

37
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,960
understand as americans is when someone

38
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,960
else is a victim we're also a victim

39
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,479
and we don't make that connection nearly

40
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,720
enough hence we have an unspeakable

41
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,320
amount of corruption in the country

42
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,840
which 10 years ago when i talked about

43
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,720
this people would think i was crazy so

44
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,159
speaking so we'll start off by saying

45
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,479
this is the ftc versus lab md cyber

46
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,320
primary politics getting to the hospital

47
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,200
after the funeral

48
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,439
so lab md very quickly

49
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,200
oh i got one of the questions up front

50
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,040
let's see who can

51
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,079
are you leaving no okay so can you save

52
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,159
me at half past the hour mike it's half

53
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,720
past the hour yes thank you

54
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,759
because i can

55
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:50,880
drown in

56
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,200
so i i worked i went to the university

57
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,280

58

raised in detroit parents police

59
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,360
officers when they met

60
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,479
one of the first kids in the family to

61
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,159
go to college

62
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,159

63
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,799
rep work at you with surgical mentored

64
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,720
making great money life goes on split

65
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,120
off open my own medical laboratory and

66
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,879
you know next thing i know i'm 47 and

67
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,319
doing great

68
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,360
pretty well off and no debt workaholic

69
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,680
diagnosing cancer that's labmd and this

70
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,760
is lab md

71
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,560
latin md was a medical laboratory that

72
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,640
worked on prostate cancer and what

73
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,520
differentiated us was our technology

74
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,640
and

75
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,800
that was because i wasn't a physician i

76
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,400
just had them work for me so i could

77
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,080
look more big picture ceo stuff and we

78
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,959
were kicking butt and out of the blue

79
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,000
one day

80
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,560
the phone rings and it's a guy

81
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,040
saying my name is robert bobbik and i've

82
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,120
got uh i found nine thousand other

83
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,000
patients on center space so 9 000

84
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,480
patients and was a big deal in 2008 and

85
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,080
where people i knew the word breach was

86
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,680
like a breach burst

87
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,599
so you could retrain this stuff and so

88
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,480
i'm just like okay how'd you find it

89
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,120
and he wouldn't tell us how he found it

90
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,000
and uh i i refused to

91
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,280
to to pay him his money to help me fix

92
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,680
it and i'll skip over a lot of that

93
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,959
because we've got the occasion bottom

94
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,680
line is we're being extorted but we but

95
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,360
the extortionist was saying he was the

96
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,480
nice guy and i called the cab county

97
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,480
police and no one really believed us and

98
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,519
then they also know what are we going to

99
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,239
do about it we have no idea and so

100
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,319
and you're sitting there by yourself

101
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,720
and you experience

102
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,080
no one really believes you and if they

103
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,120
do believe they don't know what to do

104
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,319
and you're supposed to just move on it

105
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,319
was not a good time

106
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,840
and when i wouldn't uh hire him

107
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,200
next you know the government's on my

108
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,200
back investigating us the federal trade

109
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,519
commission sent a letter in 2010

110
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,760
where we're seeing if you violated

111
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,080
section 5 of the ftc act in your when

112
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,120
your uh

113
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,680
your cyber security practices are

114
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,239
deficient now obama had just won and we

115
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,159
were terrified of obamacare and the

116
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,519
whole world was actually obama had won

117
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,360
before that but but in the middle of

118
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,680
that obamacare passed and we were

119
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,280
terrified that we have to diversify the

120
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,879
whole company because small businesses

121
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,720
were going to lose in medicine big time

122
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,280
to diversify again so we're having to

123
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,880
like cake or death what you going to do

124
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,238
are you going to worry about these guys

125
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,720
and it really set the stage for a future

126
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,839
fiasco

127
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,280
and you have all these things that you

128
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,040
have to deal with

129
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,440
that that which is

130
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,520
the second you're accused of anything

131
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,880
doubt kills you

132
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,800
especially if you're a big mouth an

133
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,440
entrepreneur that doesn't play victim

134
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,919
that has an airplane and has a big house

135
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,120
in buckhead

136
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,120
you know you're terrible human for this

137
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,400
so and the ftc goes out and says uh lab

138
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,400
indeed not employ basic risk management

139
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,600
techniques or safeguards such as

140
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,120
automated intrusion detection systems

141
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,320
file target monitoring software

142
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,680
penetration testing it also failed to

143
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,280
moderate traffic coming across club it's

144
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,919
firewalls when if you look in the file

145
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,520
we submitted there's not only the

146
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,080
firewall data but the logs

147
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,560
but who with the media or anyone that's

148
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,160
out there is a cso is going to go look

149
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,240
at that nothing so i enjoyed the fun

150
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,600
time of having i remember ciso from usf

151
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,520
or some floor just send me a shame

152
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,240
message from all over linkedin

153
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,199
giving me helpful advice that they said

154
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,800
i did admirable work but it would be so

155
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,080
much more compelling if i would just

156
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,759
admit to take responsibility for my

157
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,520
wrongs this is what's going on in

158
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,039
people's heads i appreciated that she

159
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,000
actually said it because i know there

160
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,120
are a thousand other people that just

161
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,280
thought well this juror can't admit his

162
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,680
problem and everyone else wants to just

163
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,039
avoid the blame game okay so

164
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,039
this is really about

165
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,039
what happened after all that right so

166
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,560
2009 2008 we were hacked quote unquote

167
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,680
10 to 13 we had the ftc investigation 14

168
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,440
and 15 with the administrative trial

169
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,720
congress got real crazy because i fought

170
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,880
back and holy cow

171
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,800
if you fight back they're gonna come get

172
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,360
you because you cannot teach other

173
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,680
people the fighting back is a successful

174
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,360
road they don't care if you're right or

175
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,840
wrong you just it's just like

176
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,759
kill kill the fighting bad person we

177
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,840
don't get any ideas

178
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,880
16 17 ftca returns u.s court of appeals

179
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,160
okay

180
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,520
they set up the state now you gotta

181
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,720
remember this is a really important

182
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,080
slide here because this is going to be

183
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
so indicative how they actually operate

184
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,080
uh which is they put a press release out

185
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,919
wide spread this is the ftc wide spread

186
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,240
data breaches uncovered by ftc pro ftc

187
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,319
wants their proper release of sensitive

188
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,160
consumer data repeated pure file sharing

189
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,680
networks i mean this is laughable in the

190
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,240
rearview mirror but they had a hundred

191
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,000
companies and they're investigating all

192
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,960
of them and they send cids to everybody

193
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,960
now remember that because it's gonna

194
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,560
shock you later i'm so glad i have your

195
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,160
feet approved now i'm trying to figure

196
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,440
out what is

197
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,680
section five of the ftc act i mean i

198
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,680
work with health and human services we

199
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,840
just had a perfect inspection we love

200
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,680
them they're on med techs they're

201
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,080
scientists they're not just bureaucrats

202
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,319
they're not lawyers so we i had a

203
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,520
naively fantastic relationship with our

204
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,680
regulators for 20 years

205
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,680
but i find out the ftc act came from

206
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,440
woodrow wilson

207
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,400
in 1914 so timely for the 21st century

208
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,360
and the act is is uh it seems as your

209
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,360
practice is unfair where causes are

210
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,759
likely to cause substantial

211
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,599
injury to consumers

212
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,919
cannot be avoided by consumers and is

213
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,599
outweighed by countervailing benefits to

214
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,080
consumers of competition so if you're

215
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,720
a lawyer and you look at that you go

216
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,479
well who decides what who decides

217
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,880
anything the ftc that's who if you did

218
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,160
it if you're with that you're going to

219
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,599
be having to invest your time money

220
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,720
investigation so the passage of time

221
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,000
their ignorance and corruption will

222
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,240
become all the more clear but when

223
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,840
you're in the middle of that

224
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,960
trying to figure out what does that mean

225
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,360
how do i build this system to protect my

226
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,240
company with words like this

227
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,919
you can't

228
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,160
but that's because so this is me back

229
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,120
then

230
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,759
i feel like what the hell is and why am

231
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,520
i suddenly so lonely

232
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,759
and then i had to go back and and your

233
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,400
lawyers that you're interviewing uh will

234
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,319
say things in washington like

235
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,599
um well you're toast and just settled

236
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,120
and and

237
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,919
and i'm like this isn't happening

238
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,919
and i found out woodrow wilson is

239
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,560
actually who had the brilliant idea to

240
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,560
start our administrative state over 100

241
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,400
years ago because back then we had the

242
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,720
medical and technological revolution

243
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,960
and he didn't want politicians

244
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,720
regulating all that he was a bit of an

245
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,319
arrogant racist

246
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,880
and uh and ironically that's the first

247
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,479
statue they should be tearing down when

248
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,159
they were tearing statues down but the

249
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,240
health history and he

250
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,519
um

251
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,760
you know

252
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,559
so

253
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,360
um

254
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,760
you know the founding fathers created

255
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,680
you know three branches of government

256
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,640
right the

257
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,240
executive judicial and then the

258
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,920
legislative which they actually split

259
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,160
into because they wanted to you'll love

260
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,959
this

261
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,880
prevent the legislators from over

262
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,560
legislating us

263
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,360
and so that was

264
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,519
the whole system government that point

265
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,519
but he created this sub

266
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,839
administrative

267
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,000
process where these agencies they

268
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,399
started which seemed innocent for 50

269
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,279
years

270
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,160
had

271
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,120
no

272
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,560
separation of powers they had their own

273
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,320
judges their own rules they made them

274
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,399
all and the way to take their

275
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,760
i'm i'm xyz agency i'm going to regulate

276
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,480
this who says so i say so how do we

277
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,240
unsay so that well someone's going to

278
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,160
have to sue me for 10 years who's going

279
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,760
to do that it's going to take so so

280
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,200
basically they get away with burn and

281
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,800
then what happens is

282
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,399
you have the fist

283
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,519
of power

284
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,440
and then you have bureaucrats with scan

285
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,200
experience in the worlds they regulate

286
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,640
which was not the intent of woodrow

287
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,560
wilson but what academic has ever worked

288
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,080
in reality well

289
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,519
doesn't happen

290
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,440
so medicine and technology have a common

291
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,760
burden that is we're dealing with

292
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,160
buffoons with power

293
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,040
okay so here's the quick example um this

294
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,399
guy wrote this bernie anyone else about

295
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,839
the federal trade commission and how

296
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,680
they give themselves power and it's

297
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,720
always better if someone else has aced

298
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,839
acidity so the federal trade commission

299
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,000
promulgates substantial rules of conduct

300
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,800
the commission then considers whether to

301
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,880
authorize investigations into the

302
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,240
commissions is to see whether the

303
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,240
commission's rules have been violated

304
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,920
the investigation is conducted by the

305
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,640
commission which reports its findings to

306
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,480
the commission if the commission thinks

307
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,000
that the commission's findings weren't

308
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,920
an enforcement action the commission

309
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,000
issues a complaint the commission's

310
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,519
complaint that a commission rule has

311
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,600
been violated is then prosecuted by the

312
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,399
commission

313
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,720
and adjudicated by the commission this

314
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,560
commission adjudication can either take

315
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,640
place before a full commission or before

316
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,399
a semi-autonomous commission

317
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,320
administrative law judge if the

318
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,160
commission chooses to adjudicate before

319
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,920
the administrative law judge rather than

320
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,160
the commission the commission can appeal

321
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,519
to the commission

322
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,279
if the commission ultimately finds a

323
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,640
violation then and only then the

324
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,240
affected private party can appeal to an

325
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,560
article 3 court but the agency decision

326
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,240
even before the bona fide article 3

327
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,560
tribunal possesses a strong presumption

328
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,640
of correctness and matters both effect

329
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,800
and law that means you're screwed settle

330
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,240
mike

331
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,040
because and if and if i spent an hour

332
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,480
explaining that to you you would

333
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,040
probably think that i have an attitude

334
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,839
but what we have is all these regulators

335
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,440
being guns with guns we're here to save

336
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,640
the world we're going to shoot you and

337
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,959
if you push back you're dead

338
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,120
and so settle

339
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,360
and don't fight back

340
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,200
or i'm going to get pissed

341
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,680
and this is your lawyer's advice right

342
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,680
or we're going to

343
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,959
save the world by bearing your

344
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,399
procedures and data

345
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,680
and congresses of the last 20 years

346
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,760
50 years will give us this great option

347
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,640
we can

348
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,120
just go right at you to federal court

349
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,040
and tear you up the shows there but

350
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,640
that's for the people that we really

351
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,240
know we're going to win but if we really

352
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,000
want to format you we want to tear the

353
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,680
shreds or really grind you through the

354
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,040
system we're going to take you to our

355
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,360
own court first where we make our own

356
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,040
rules and the federal rules of civil

357
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,200
procedure don't work we have our own

358
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,279
rules which means we get to

359
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,839
drain you dry with financial but you

360
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,079
don't participate in federal procedure

361
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,760
hearsay's allowed

362
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,160
because they can say any made-up crap

363
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,000
they want about you like what they did

364
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,360
and what i read earlier which turned out

365
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,120
to be completely untrue and the

366
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,720
administrative judge is supposed to

367
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,760
decide

368
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,079
which is crap and which to which which

369
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,079
sticks

370
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,000
attributes are privileged so all your

371
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,680
investigators are privileged so we don't

372
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,920
get to say anything there's no there's

373
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,079
no discovery barely a little amount of

374
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,120
templates you know we've got to keep it

375
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,639
back over here at the whole time because

376
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,399
it's not an article three court so

377
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,440
you're not allowed to know what the

378
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,360
other side says we take now do you think

379
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,920
the legal publications that put stories

380
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,120
about lavende and the wall street

381
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,959
journal and forbes et cetera

382
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,959
say any of that no

383
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,839
so i had the fun time of of running

384
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,480
around saying the very effective line of

385
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,240
we didn't do that which everyone

386
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,839
immediately believed

387
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,600
so you have reputation assassination

388
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,079
psychological warfare cooperation damage

389
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,800
operations chevron deference which is a

390
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,040
a supreme court ruling from 40 50 years

391
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,720
ago that drives everyone crazy now which

392
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,920
said

393
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,120
well

394
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,880
you gotta give huge difference to the

395
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,680
government because they're the

396
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,800
government

397
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,399
so every judge has always hid behind

398
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,600
that so what this is in reality is head

399
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,839
on a spike regulation in cyber security

400
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,839
technology because congress will pass

401
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,040
nothing

402
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,880
so what we're going to do

403
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,279
is we're going to just find anybody out

404
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,720
in the industry and we're going to pull

405
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,440
them out like a lottery

406
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,360
and they didn't do anything and we're

407
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,000
going to make them sign a consent decree

408
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,320
to say what they did wrong and they're

409
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,720
going to sign it just to make us go away

410
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,240
and they'll have a nice day and we'll

411
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,079
just get on with it and then we'll be

412
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,440
able to take this list of what you

413
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,680
shouldn't do and all the big law firms

414
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,720
are going to charge you a thousand

415
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,399
dollars an hour so you know what to take

416
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,800
to your board to know not what to do and

417
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,040
i am the head on a spike that wouldn't

418
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,720
shut the f up

419
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,320
this pissed them off

420
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,480
because they were destroying a cancer

421
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,959
detection center and nobody wanted to

422
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,199
point that out that we had 700 000

423
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,040
patients that we had diagnosed for

424
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,480
cancer and you know what there's not a

425
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,480
lot of them that are that good

426
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,160
but that you know

427
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,120
i mean

428
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,839
they were so amused at first that i was

429
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,360
pissed off and then it moved to

430
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,040
annoyance and now i learned all the

431
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,040
unfortunate experience of people wanting

432
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,839
me to shut the f up

433
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,920
i was like amazing well clearly your

434
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,000
mother is now one of our patients

435
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,800
so so i go to con to to um

436
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,639
to congress and that was another

437
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,079
experience i'll just let this speak for

438
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,760
itself

439
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,760
and then the bottom one game is they

440
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,519
exhaust you into submissions so you're

441
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,040
out of resources before you get to a

442
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,800
fair and impartial court because they

443
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,079
get to run that years right and so it's

444
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,279
nothing but a game of steam roll

445
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,600
and so i start doing more research about

446
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,680
this tyversa character because now i'm

447
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,519
going to face some sort of a trial in a

448
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,000
kangaroo court and i find out that

449
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,600
homeland security had hired dartmouth

450
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
with 25 million dollars who hired

451
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,760
tybersa the company that called me on

452
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,639
the phone to start doing research for

453
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,399
homeland security

454
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,800
and about all these medical leaks that

455
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,760
were all over the world and so and and

456
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,000
wesley clerks on their advisory board as

457
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,600
well as our friend howard schmidt and

458
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,360
all sorts of other well

459
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,360
respected academic people you know what

460
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,519
that means that means that no one vets

461
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,880
you when you go to washington because

462
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,040
you know so-and-so so they let the the

463
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,839
crook in the door

464
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,920
and so this guy traversa thank goodness

465
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,360
for google

466
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,360
or youtube or whatever because this guy

467
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,519
we look back at this now he said on

468
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,880
these videos that they do 300 to 1.8

469
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,639
billion searches per day 4.5 million

470
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,560
workstations worldwide 1.3 million files

471
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,240
downloaded and they put the ft lmd file

472
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,519
up in front of a house oversight

473
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,440
committee and 07. so i so i'm looking at

474
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,279
this i'm sorry oh nine i'm looking at

475
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,759
this in like 11 in the room here going

476
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,160
holy gosh i i'm like famous didn't even

477
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,240
know it i'm sitting here in oversight

478
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,000
committees and my files in warren

479
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,240
magazine no one ever called me and i'm

480
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,320
just this big example

481
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,839
and this is what they do they'll pick a

482
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,600
small one and because it's not the point

483
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,279
to really get you're just supposed to be

484
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,360
an example so no one knows

485
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,680
and um because it's really about shaking

486
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,519
you down to shut you up

487
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,920
and ty versa is supposed to be this

488
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,920
right hand wonderful company

489
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,440
and you were just supposed to sign the

490
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,440
consent ukraine get along and here's the

491
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,759
game of the ftc we're going to create

492
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,759
common law because congress don't make a

493
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,680
law on cyber security we're going to

494
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,160
create common law through pattern so

495
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,800
judges can go oh see the pattern and we

496
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,040
create common law by getting the consent

497
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,440
degree beat up beat up beat up 27

498
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,880
companies and then we build the

499
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,720
precedent and then we get to avoid

500
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,120
courts and juries and then we mislead

501
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,639
stonewall congress because we go in

502
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,160
there once a year for three minutes

503
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,079
going everything's great

504
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,320
and then we play hero to the press

505
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,680
and the last time i checked the list of

506
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,279
valedictorians most of them did not go

507
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,559
to journalism school nothing personal

508
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,480
so my own lawyers

509
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,119
sorry richard

510
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,359
was really annoyed because i was going

511
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,079
we didn't do anything and my lawyer who

512
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,400
worked at the ftc for 20 years said you

513
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,919
know if you don't settle they're going

514
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,520
to watch you forever and they can always

515
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,520
come back and so i'm sitting here going

516
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,599
can this get any worse my own lawyer's

517
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,880
billing me to threaten the hell out of

518
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,400
me

519
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,000
so we're lambs to slaughter and it's

520
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,080
persecution through process and this is

521
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,760
the reality of the administrative

522
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,280
situation okay which means you can't get

523
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,440
to an independent agency

524
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,960
until you're through what's below the

525
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,039
red line and that takes years of money

526
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,480
so you got that point so it's a long

527
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,640
slog of justice mountain

528
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,240
and it's not what we learned on the tv

529
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,919
show because you're because you are

530
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,520
going to be the flying appointment

531
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,080
you're ignored by law government when i

532
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,760
say well i mean big law media and

533
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,240
business because everyone's afraid

534
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,160
and it's really a self-preservation game

535
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,880
but i started to win

536
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,200
and then everyone else started to notice

537
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,919
because my company folded

538
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,280
and then

539
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,160
real people went oh wow if dougherty

540
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,320
loses we're stuck with an agency they

541
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,559
can just run their us into the ground no

542
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,480
matter who we are so maybe we better

543
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,720
give a damn about ourselves

544
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,600
so but i digress

545
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,559
so

546
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,400
one of the commissioners talked about

547
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,280
how

548
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,360
the fix was in uh

549
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,760
their administrative process gives them

550
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,360
huge advantages in the past 20 years ftc

551
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,919
here ruled in favor so when the judge

552
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,880
rules when the ftc judge rules against

553
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,480
the ftc the ftc commissioners always

554
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,919
overturned

555
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,240
and in the 20 years

556
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,559
100 of the overturned cases stayed

557
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,320
overturned so what good has happened in

558
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,840
administrative law judge

559
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,080
so and then when you get out and go the

560
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,360
appellate court you're finally out to

561
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,120
freedom they lose half the time so

562
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,200
there's a problem we get we start

563
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,960
getting to court finally

564
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,480
and the courts uh said no one's really

565
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,840
litigated your authority in this area to

566
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,799
do this although you apparently have

567
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,559
done a lot of it and that means 37

568
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,559
companies before me had actually just

569
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,000
rolled over and you can hear every

570
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,080
corporation of america do this

571
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,640
oh it's expensive okay and so basically

572
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,240
self-preservation

573
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,320
and let the beast get bigger so the

574
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,919
screws are neighbor that's what they're

575
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,679
doing so much for their community

576
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:24,640
service

577
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,840
you know tag at the bottom of the

578
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,120
website

579
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,520
i'm going to skip over some of this but

580
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,200
because it's really about steamrolling

581
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,679
and bullying and i decided that okay i'm

582
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:34,799
going to be dead

583
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,160
i'm going to write

584
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,200
a book

585
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,080
because i i have enough

586
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,600
i just wanted this documented and i

587
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
wrote it like a novel because if i just

588
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,039
get up and yell scream and rant no one

589
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,640
wants to realize you really have to

590
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,799
understand writing like a novel brings

591
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,559
the reader into their own self-interest

592
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,400
and that's the whole goal like why the

593
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,400
hell do i care about this i'm sorry for

594
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,559
you mike get over it but this is about

595
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,919
well yeah except this is our government

596
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,679
my friend

597
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,600
this is several thousand cancer patients

598
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,440
so you get over the fact that you can't

599
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,120
figure out why this is important so i

600
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,840
but i had to learn to write it up so i

601
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,000
did and it was

602
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,880
really

603
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,240
more i mean i got to tell you it was

604
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,600
incredible

605
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,039
i never really thought it was going to

606
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,520
take off like i did but

607
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,400
so

608
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,360
this really annoyed the ftc

609
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,080
uh we went into our pre-trial first

610
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,240
hearing and white had one lawyer and one

611
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,400
paralegal and they marched in

612
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,039
seven lawyers and 13 paralegals it was

613
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,840
like it was just like

614
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,200
lockstep and then he comes up to my lord

615
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,440
he goes we're very upset about the book

616
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,200
and my lawyer i was very proud of my

617
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,720
lawyer when he said

618
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,280
i guess we just saved 20 free copies and

619
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,080
so i was like right on way to fight back

620
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,320
because nothing pisses off a bureaucrat

621
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,240
than not being afraid of them

622
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,720
that sends them in the outer zone of

623
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,840
crazy

624
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,799
so that followed up by disrespect

625
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,360
which this book is all about a mirror

626
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,760
this book is nothing more but a mirror

627
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,000
and what these bureaucrats live on they

628
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,600
think that they're working for 200 a

629
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,960
year when they can go on to corporate

630
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,240
make 600 so they think they're

631
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,600
sacrificing for america and they're

632
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,280
wonderful people and they don't pat each

633
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,559
other on the back right there and some

634
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,840
of them are fine

635
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,919
but there's no accountability when most

636
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,200
of them aren't

637
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,559
and so

638
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,480
i really intentionally went for their

639
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,400
self-image so to speak

640
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,919
so because i knew justice and fairness

641
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,679
was not on their table

642
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,400
so they came at me shocking all 40

643
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,120
40 subpoenas they're terrifying everyone

644
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,679
doctors nurses

645
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,320
customers tech people uh i mean my

646
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,520
personal assistant i thought they're

647
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,559
gonna i really thought they're gonna

648
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,559
subpoena my mother because she worked

649
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,919
she filed some insurance stuff for me

650
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:44,960
for like three months i thought they

651
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,400
were gonna go for mom

652
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,720
and what this does is this makes

653
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,440
everyone go okay there's doubt around

654
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,720
here i need a job mike's a stubborn sob

655
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,080
see ya

656
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,679
and that worked really well

657
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,360
so the company closed six months after

658
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,559
this

659
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,640
and we go to the hearing and the judge

660
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,480
says the ftc okay exactly how is lab md

661
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,480
supposed to know what to do

662
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,159
and i luckily can take this out the

663
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,240
transcript where the guy says there is

664
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,600
nothing out there for a company to look

665
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,320
to

666
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,480
well i naively and stupidly thought ah

667
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,320
game said match we're done now there's

668
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,159
no law in writing and no corporation

669
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,400
could know what to do i guess we're gone

670
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,640
wrong oh oh there's no place for you to

671
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,000
know what to do and you're violating the

672
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,120
law and you're still going through this

673
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,520
yeah oh okay

674
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,919
and so everybody i mean i spoke to marco

675
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,679
rubio about this at the conference about

676
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,679
your life and he goes i know terrifying

677
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:36,559
isn't it

678
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,640
anyway

679
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,559
that's pretty much any i mean i was all

680
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,720
over the hill and all i'm learning is oh

681
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,400
my god they all know and there's nothing

682
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,600
they can do about it and that they want

683
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,280
to do about it so it's steamroll

684
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,200
steamroll steamroll steamroll now people

685
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,960
say out to me well we had a hippa

686
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,200
violation it's always good there was no

687
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,520
hipaa violation and it helped health and

688
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,960
human services

689
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,799
wrote themselves there was none i'll

690
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,360
skip you i'll skip over the details so

691
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,840
the company closed and i had to call i

692
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,880
mean i never lost money ever

693
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,000
since the company opened in 1996 not one

694
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,799
year until 2013 we lost almost a million

695
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:13,760
bucks

696
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,280
so i had to shut to stop the bleeding

697
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,600
and so what i say is vilny wears many

698
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,360
vet masks none more danger than the mask

699
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,240
of virtue and this is the game they play

700
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,640
they're they're sobs behind the scene

701
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,360
and i mean horror stories and if you say

702
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,679
the horror story people think you're

703
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,000
a conspiracy theorist or have an axe to

704
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,400
cry obsessed so you either you have to

705
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,039
be nice and not be emotional and then

706
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,960
they're not going to be the problem

707
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,760
or if you're not nice and emotional

708
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,799
they're not going to want to hear you so

709
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,240
it was a really tough situation for a

710
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,960
long time it started to change later but

711
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,080
that's once we got court wins which took

712
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,360
years

713
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,559
so

714
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,799
i wrote the book the book came out

715
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,320
and then this is where you start

716
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,919
throwing hail mary pass and a

717
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,559
whistleblower comes out guy calls me

718
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,960
in april 14 hi

719
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,080
i'm um i'm the guy that stole your file

720
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,559
and i uh and my name is richard wallace

721

and i work for diverse and i quit

722
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,520
yesterday and i stole everything and

723
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,720
it's worse than knowing your book's

724
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,679
correct

725
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,240
and and and i got an award from robert

726
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,559
miller that that's rick on the right

727
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,919
and

728
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,600
the i take him to daryl ice and they

729
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,159
start investigating and we have hearings

730
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,760
the summer 14

731
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,720
and

732
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,600
it is insane to see it every time i

733
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,799
thought okay

734
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,400
i'm testifying for a house oversight

735
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,679
okay i can't tell anyone anything's

736
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:36,559
going on in the summer because i'm

737
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,559
working with house oversight like crazy

738
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,120
we're going to win

739
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,840
i'm testifying in front of congress

740
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,279
c-span won't put it on because jay

741
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,600
rockefeller scared the crap out of them

742
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,840
no meat is there including conservative

743
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,159
media by the way

744
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:59,360
yeah fox news no heritage no cato no

745
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,279
it's like no no no i'm sorry

746
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,440
it's it's just theater theater for the

747
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,159
damned and so we start going through

748
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,679
this after

749
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,120
and we start reverse engineering what

750
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,240
happened

751
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,279
and i mean daryl isa deserves a

752
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,360
humanitarian award because he was well

753
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,039
aware of what i was up against and he

754
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,880
went up against it anyway and we got a

755
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,320
lot of information

756
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,960
about um how they were funneling secrets

757
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,640
back and forth and they did it by

758
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,400
creating a false company the ftc wanted

759
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,320
all the data and all the companies from

760
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
typersa that they had found

761
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,080
leaking files because those were bad

762
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,120
companies without the proper the cyber

763
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,080
security

764
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,320
which they can say what that is

765
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,840
and so

766
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,360
ty versus said we're not doing that we

767
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,279
don't be known as the boy for the for

768
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,600
the f for the ftc so he said we'll

769
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,440
create a false company and so they

770
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,799
created the privacy institute out of

771
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,240
delaware which had uh the ceo's uncle as

772
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,159
the address and that's how they'd funnel

773
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,320
everything and it was a steam roll and

774
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,880
and in addition it wasn't just me it was

775
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,640
thousands of companies and the

776
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,880
whistleblower said they stole they they

777
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,640
told the media and the feds that an iran

778
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,640
ip address downloaded disclosed the

779
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,960
prince of the uh president's helicopter

780
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,760
marine one really they stole it from a

781
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,919
from a consultant's place that changed

782
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,120
same thing happened with supreme court

783
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,279
justice briars in the washington post he

784
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,880
they stole themselves and changed the

785
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,279
metadata made it up

786
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,799
so now things are getting really

787
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,720
uncomfortable for the ftc and they want

788
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,799
me to shut up and we end up in court

789
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,640
again this is some of the some of the

790
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,480
outrageous things that they would come

791
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,039
into court and say and you observe they

792
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,360
don't care about judges or courts

793
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,679
they're contemptuous of these people and

794
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,279
so the judge would say so you have no

795
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,799
information to establish how evidence is

796
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,559
obtained is that you're right yes that's

797
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,240
correct so we don't know how i got it so

798
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,360
you don't know where the evidence came

799
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,720
from you don't know how these people got

800
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,000
possession of it you don't know whether

801
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,200
they originated from webbing or some

802
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,559
other place but you were going to use

803
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,080
that to show that certain others were

804
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,740
damaged yes your holy cow remember this

805
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,880
[Music]

806
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,640
okay so the judge is right on them but

807
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,159
they don't care because they've got

808
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,960
government deference

809
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,200
so there's teemo in us and we get to go

810
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,039
to kangaroo court

811
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,240
and then we end up through kangaroo and

812
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,279
now basically i'm on trial

813
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,039
every day and the congressional

814
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,039
investigation is going on so i'm loving

815
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,200
this internal mind so it comes so chirpy

816
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,600
when i'm in court because i'm like oh my

817
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,840
gosh it's investigating all you pieces

818
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,440
of crap

819
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,760
so so that just goes

820
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,760
this is a judge you get a lot of bad

821
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,399
judges this just was awesome says hang

822
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:33,840
on a second you don't plan to do

823
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,279
evidence of harm but your position is

824
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,480
that doesn't mean no harm occurred is

825
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,720
that what occurred that's correct do you

826
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,919
plan to use evidence of actual

827
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,640
penetration we are not gonna no so you

828
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,480
know you're a rapist but we don't have a

829
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,360
girl

830
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,559
okay

831
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,360
but we think you might have done it

832
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,640
so

833
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,240
they said

834
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,520
the court's order provides that lab md

835
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,360
can't know

836
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,360
may not discover the legal standards ftc

837
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,799
has used in the past is currently using

838
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,520
enforce section five so they're pointing

839
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,240
out the court says you by the law and

840
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,720
you can't know a law you violated and i

841
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,039
just say this in quotes of a transfer

842
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,720
because who would believe me if i said

843
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,600
that

844
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,120
i would not believe me

845
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,039
but more steamrolling

846
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,679
so rick comes in so the ftc wrestler

847
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,440
case and then here comes rick and he

848
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,880
pleads the fifth and blank hits the fan

849
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,240
and

850
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,760
everyone is just uh everyone is now like

851
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,440
hot potato crazy i'm gonna skip the

852
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,760
whole summer thing because

853
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,799
thank you

854
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,159
so um

855
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,000
we're doing well actually and what i'm

856
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,159
learning at this point is now we have

857
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,799
all this evidence we've got transcripts

858
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,120
we get reports we've got all the stuff

859
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,960
and everyone's gone i've been 60 minutes

860
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,480
60 i'm in new york

861
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,600
three times

862
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,919
not interested wonder why because the

863
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,039
producer was on the obama campaign when

864
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,880
she started and she works for stephen

865
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,600
croft and they they do all the ftc stuff

866
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,080
and they're not going to defend little

867
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,080
irrelevant me

868
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,080
so that they burn their stories from

869
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,440
president obama sorry have a nice day

870
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,039
because journalism is a business

871
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,640
so everyone's whistling past the

872
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,000
graveyard

873
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,520
but then the department of justice gave

874
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,960
rick immunity

875
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,279
which shocked everybody

876
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,120
and i thought oh here we go and the

877
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,760
congressional report comes out which is

878
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,880
ty versa and the ftc had a quid pro quo

879
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,159
relationship

880
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,399
you give us companies

881
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,039
we tell you who we're investigating you

882
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,559
approach them and they'll know you have

883
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,120
inside information and they'll hire you

884
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,480
metlife

885
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,039
lifelock million dollars million dollars

886
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,440
so they went and made a ton of money

887
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,480
that's okay because justice

888
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,600
so in closing arguments in the ftc court

889
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,039
so just so i'm clear the government's

890
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,720
position is a mere breach is all that's

891
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,000
required for this election five

892
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,919
violation your honor a breach is not

893
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,799
required that statement is what woke up

894
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,480
corporate america

895
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,399
give a damn about me

896
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,880
until that moment and then everyone's

897
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,440
like oh my god you mean this isn't just

898
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,399
a little entertaining legal show

899
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:17,679
with some dramatic big mouth

900
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,080
entrepreneurs we might get stuck with

901
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,360
this bag

902
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,120
that's right so how many how many

903
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,799
victims have you identified we have not

904
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,640

00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,960
okay now they're going to get

919
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,080

that the ftc can just overturn them and

927
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,159
the ftc did that

928
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,480
so and the ftc knows okay

929
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,760
they hate my guts big time because

930
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,760

rule book you're just supposed to roll

932
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,360
over and everyone can accuse you for the

933
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,960
rest of your days and lose your company

934

936
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,360
shark and they they had to overrule with

937
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,880
nothing but lies i'll skip through that

938
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,039
in a minute here okay so now the media

939

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,279
court of appeals an article 3 judge

943

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,240
paid

955
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,320
fantastic cyber

956
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,000
law well they're big from them but their

957
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
cyber department is known for if you

958
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,679
want to roll over to the government

959
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,679
we're your people because most of these

960
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,840
people not to mention a few you know law

961
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,080
firms i'm not gonna mention a ton but

962
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,399
they're um they're all infiltrated with

963
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,000
people that used to work at the ftc and

964
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,080
once you have a ftc

965
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,559
you know badge on you know once a nazi

966
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,120
always a nazi so you can't wipe that

967
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,880
stuff off when you're in another when

968
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,120
you're in a law firm so that now we

969
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,519
wanted to judge the lottery again i i if

970
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,200
i had two more hours i could talk about

971
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,480
the judge's way they were terrible but

972
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,600
we got this

973
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,240
we got judge cho flat 88 years old at

974
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,559
the time not even senior status judge

975
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:53,600
appointed by gerald ford 88 going on 50

976
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,679
reads everything doesn't trust as well

977
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,919
as clerks people that i know that used

978
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,919
to clerk for him are just all like oh my

979
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,240
god you've got to show flag this is so

980
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,840
good for you no idea

981
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,240
so we get to oral argument

982
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,360
and and he starts going after him it

983
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,799
doesn't underscore the importance or

984
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,480
significance of rule making otherwise

985
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,919
you're regulating data secure in a

986
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,840
case-by-case basis

987
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,159
and here we now keep in mind this is 10

988
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,320
years later i finally get the sentence

989
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,720
from these bastards which is we are

990
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,960
regulating data secured on case-by-case

991
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,720
basis and that's exactly what the

992
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,480
supreme court says in the atlantic and

993
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,039
chenery the agency is entitled to

994
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,279
now that's bs by the way but a lawyer

995
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,200
will say anything right because that's

996
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,399
their job

997
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,000
so and it doesn't matter whether the

998
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,480
subject is any notice at all

999
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,559
so folks just understand

1000
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,720
you're not allowed to know what you have

1001
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,760
to do to comply with the law in your

1002
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,159
large expensive companies and when you

1003
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,559
screw up that guillotine from the board

1004
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,279
is going to whack your head right off

1005
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,200
but that's okay just take it so they'll

1006
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,039
get correct correct all right so notice

1007
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,960
becomes irrelevant you can adopt new

1008
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,640
rules and adjudication know what that

1009
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,200
means that means i get to say what the

1010
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,800
rules are after the violation

1011
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,119
new rules after the violation i'm

1012
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,040
allowed to do that because the supreme

1013
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,679
court made that uh very clear what you

1014
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,520
missing just the texas at this point the

1015
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,599
judges are chuckling i appreciate your

1016
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,879
confessions

1017
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,520
because you're like no you can't more

1018
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,119
steamrolling

1019
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,440
this is about

1020
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,040
truly persecution through punishment do

1021
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,399
you think these lawyers cared if they

1022
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:31,839
lost you know they're making a

1023
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:33,280
quarterback they don't care he's doing

1024
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,040
their job a bunch o'clock you know so

1025
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,040
that and now this is a headline

1026
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,639
decision reigns in the ftc's authority

1027
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,000
to actually broadly award him and he'll

1028
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,760
define orders which cracks at this

1029
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,918
because of all the lawyers especially

1030
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:47,839
the academic guys out of berkeley

1031
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,719
you know and georgia tech you know oh

1032
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,079
the government the government department

1033
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,520
and then suddenly when you get you don't

1034
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,159
get like oh we were wrong you get

1035
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,839
the silence of the lambs that's what you

1036
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:58,720
get

1037
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,040
so and then nothing goes on

1038
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,160
and so i get the equal access to just a

1039
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,400
sec so i go through we win with the

1040
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,160
court of appeals

1041
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,040
it's all going well and then um so to

1042
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,920
speak

1043
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,680
you know i should say going well but i

1044
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,119
mean because i i'm gonna turn i'm sort

1045
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,960
of a genetic optimist no matter what i'm

1046
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,800
in a good mood and so that's kind of a

1047
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,160
lucky break for this and uh but but

1048
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,040
there was no the way to really sue them

1049
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,480
but i thought but one of my lawyers said

1050
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,960
that equal access to justice act so this

1051
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,400
is only the government would call this

1052
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,720
the equal access to justice act you're

1053
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,520
allowed when you are a company with net

1054
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,640
revenues of less than seven million to

1055
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,960
to file for reimbursement for your legal

1056
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,839
fees

1057
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:42,880
if you

1058
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,880
defeat the government

1059
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,640
and they have to pay back and the

1060
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,040
maximum hourly rate adjusted for

1061
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,680
inflation in 2018 was 192 an hour

1062
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,680
and my lawyer's billable rates were

1063
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,920
between 800 and fifteen hundred and

1064
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,920
fifty dollars an hour

1065
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,920
and so and my by this time my case

1066
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,280
getting so much media by the way my

1067
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,960
lawyers in boston were all really

1068
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,119
excited about it because they got a

1069
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,920
whole whole media piece ran on this and

1070
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,520
talked about how expensive they were

1071
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,000
robeson great which which translated how

1072
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,320
incredibly good they were and even

1073
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,480
though the reporter goes

1074
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,640
these people are so good that this is

1075
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,880
how much they get so

1076
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,119
they were fired up and it's true i mean

1077
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,560
he's phenomenal and when you're talking

1078
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,119
a multi-billion dollar company

1079
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,640
that's you get

1080
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,119
but that that's which is why that's not

1081
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,359
who they pick on

1082
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,240
so we for 16 million dollars of invoices

1083
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,880
submitted we i got 840 grand because

1084
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,920
it's an equal access to justice

1085
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,480
and now yes were you allowed to go over

1086
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,720
uh after like loss of income for you're

1087
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,560
going out on oh

1088
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,560
no

1089
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,119
no because it's the government

1090
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,640
what about what about the patients that

1091
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,520
you were

1092
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,839
oh no no no no no no because there's no

1093
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,240
patient damage we protected all of them

1094
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,240
and so now now just listen now that's

1095
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,240
the trial fire okay so now now we're

1096
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,839
assuming that just like me i assume that

1097
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,839
was on a reality okay so subsequent to

1098
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,920
that we found things up and here's a few

1099
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,520
things after things settled i'm just

1100
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,320
gonna

1101
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,760
go through we find out in 2014 that rick

1102
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,079
wallace went through

1103
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,119
two attorney law firms because they kept

1104
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,680
screwing him over and he he finally had

1105
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,920
to find a lawyer that

1106
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,480
he had that would believe what was going

1107
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,200
on he is a cyber criminal right he is

1108
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,079
got criminal immunity he has has left

1109
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,480
this organization he's basically bs

1110
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,200
congress for several years uh and he's

1111
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,920
got the money and and so

1112
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,240
he the first lawyers just took the money

1113
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,920
and ran and just once the bill ran out

1114
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,560
they left because we got money through a

1115
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,800
non-profit and then the second lawyer

1116
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,960
they fired them after three weeks so

1117
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,480
unless with me i was talking to rick a

1118
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,160
lot but i was not talking that much at

1119
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,079
this point and he hired mary beth

1120
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,520
buchanan the u.s attorney for the

1121
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,720
western director of pennsylvania and he

1122
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,160
did that because she was the one that

1123
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,720
was working with him back when she was

1124
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,000
in office and he was doing all this

1125
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,839
stuff in the 2000s

1126
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,160
but we didn't know until 2018 when one

1127
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,440
of my lawyers went to work at the white

1128
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,400
house

1129
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,920
and then he calls me

1130
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,280
she's been

1131
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,119
committing a felony i mean this is her

1132
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,599
primary case she was working in so why

1133
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,960
do you think she's taking this

1134
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,960
representation so he filed freedom of

1135
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,960
information next on all this meaning

1136
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,200
stuff and lo and behold

1137
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,720
five days before he testified in

1138
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,520
immunity she's meeting with the ftc and

1139
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,680
from a miraculous act of god or a really

1140
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,680
good friend of the ftc i don't know we

1141
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,960
had 10 we got 140 pages and in the foia

1142
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,760
in

1143
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,079
uh in 10 and

1144
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,119
in

1145
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,280
66 months which is incredible it takes

1146
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,960
like years

1147
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,359
the top 10 pages were fully redacted and

1148
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,359
the bottom 10 pages were the top 10

1149
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,839
pages fully unredacted so i can't

1150
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,040
believe that kind of mistake was

1151
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,839
unintentional that was merry christmas

1152
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,440
five days before testimony she's been

1153
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,880
with me with every big shot now here's

1154
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,880
the thing to understand his criminal

1155
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,680
immunity was only when he was sitting in

1156
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,920
the stand and therefore he had to

1157
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,800
testify everything that happened to be

1158
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,320
immune from being persecuted for the

1159
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,480
years before so and she put a letter

1160
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,280
into the court asking her if she could

1161
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,760
be the one to redirect him so that she

1162
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,079
could get everything out which i

1163
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,880
approved because i still was not even

1164
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,960
stupid because i thought

1165
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,640
what former u.s attorney is going to lie

1166
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,680
to the court

1167
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,200
and so she got up there and she didn't

1168
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,560
pull it all out

1169
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,640
and then the fact that whole part of

1170
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,800
what he did criminally that she didn't

1171
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,720
bring out on the stand she used against

1172
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,720
leverage for him for the next four years

1173
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,960
to threaten him with his immunity if he

1174
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,880
kept talking to me because things would

1175
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,720
creep out

1176
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,800
so this is the threat that what she

1177
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,040
would do and it was all about the power

1178
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,760
and that the government has to be

1179
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,640
lawless and the power they have to not

1180
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,359
be held accountable that's what this

1181
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,359
story really is about it's complete lack

1182
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,200
of accountability and the self-interest

1183
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,119
to everyone here is that this is who we

1184
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,880
have trying to run cyber security so

1185
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,040
it's just the wild wild west of crazy

1186
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,520
and you have a ton of lawyers making a

1187
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,440
ton of money off of this and you have an

1188
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,480
entire privacy uh uh you know about

1189
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,520
industry

1190
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,520
i don't mind having another chat one day

1191
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,119
about how what the dirty things i can

1192
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,800
say about iapp

1193
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,520
you know enabling these people

1194
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,359
because it's money it's money money

1195
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,960
money money money

1196
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,680
so

1197
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,400
they actually ipp actually had a web

1198
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,560
conference what they had to pay 149

1199
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,520
dollars

1200
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,640
a member for to listen to coincidentally

1201
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,520
the lead person prosecuting me so she

1202
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,599
could tell you what to do when the ftc

1203
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,280
sent you a subpoena

1204
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,760
but they didn't get a counter so this is

1205
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,560
how these organizations are in the bag

1206
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,920
all right

1207
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,400
what i learned over time through finding

1208
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,240
things out outside the legal process

1209
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,720
which is oh we run a wild goose chase

1210
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,640
the bullets aaron is married chase and

1211
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,000
then attempt a waste of time a red

1212
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,960
herring lost cause wasted effort

1213
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,880
because we had other litigation going on

1214
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,880
and we had a deposition and in the

1215
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,960
deposition it said mr wallace take her

1216
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,800
with the term epdp yes what did you

1217
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,800
understand pppp it's an enhanced period

1218
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,400
of your application is it commercially

1219
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,640
available no where is it who developed

1220
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,839
it to your knowledge it was a

1221
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,680
collaboration of law enforcement how did

1222
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,920
you get access to epdp if in your view

1223
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,520
it wasn't commercially available it was

1224
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,079
given to me by whom by the fbi who had

1225
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,480
the fbi greg frank announced here's the

1226
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,839
deal

1227
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:39,200
in 2008 or nine

1228
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,319
the software that ty versa used to break

1229
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,720
into thousands of companies

1230
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,119
and the 100 the ftc certified was not

1231
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:49,520
even taken with their own software

1232
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,720
and it took

1233
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,400
how many years was that

1234
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,280
11 years to find that out because i'm on

1235
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,119
a stubborn sob

1236
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,800
and um which is not nearly a good thing

1237
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,640
and so

1238
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,599
then so so what happened and i i'm gonna

1239
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,920
i was just gonna read this to you uh

1240
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,599
because the whole thing is about cancel

1241
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,599
culture cancel me one way or the other

1242
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:14,400
any way you can by attacking anyone that

1243
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,839
could want to help and again the log

1244
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,079
slot now i understand why it was so

1245
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,800
steep i understand why

1246
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,119
they're hiding the fact that

1247
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,040
it's giving an award to a cyber crook oh

1248
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,079
my god um and that it's it's a big it's

1249
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:31,599
it's a protection racket it's just a

1250
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,280
protection ring okay

1251
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,240
so

1252
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,280
let me just

1253
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,720
read the whole now we're gonna get to

1254
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,000
what really happened i'm just gonna read

1255
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,880
it

1256
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,880
the ftc heard of companies allegedly

1257
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,880
finding proprietary files floating on

1258
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,960
cyberspace via p2p networks at a

1259
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,640
congressional hearing in 2007.

1260
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,720
the fptc reached out to company

1261
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,480
testifying diversa saying that they

1262
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,720
would be sending the cid to diversa for

1263
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,200
those allegedly leaked files

1264
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,800
tigers have pushed back stating they

1265
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,280
would find the cid because they didn't

1266
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,040
they didn't want to be seen as embedded

1267
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,160
with the feds

1268
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,400
the ftc told diversity to create a sham

1269
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,560
company to funnel the files

1270
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,480
through subdiversity created the privacy

1271
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,960
institute and the ftc senate cid there

1272
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,800
and a cid is a criminal investigation a

1273
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,480
simple investigation demand

1274
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,319
upon receipt of the files the ftc

1275
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,319
noticed okay here's

1276
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,319
here's criminal act number one

1277
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:24,079
upon receipt of the files the ftc

1278
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:25,680
noticed that the files possessed

1279
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,520
metadata showing that they were taken

1280
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,000
directly from the owning company

1281
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,040
computers and were not as represented in

1282
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,599
congress and elsewhere floating outside

1283
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,839
of space now here's why that is so

1284
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:40,480
huge

1285
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,800
there was a there was a ninth circuit

1286
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,440
ruling in like 2002 a child pornographer

1287
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,560
had been

1288
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,160
busted criminally and he appealed up the

1289
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,760
appeals court he said the government

1290
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,200
came into my computer and took these

1291
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,720
files that's illegal search and seizure

1292
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,400
the fourth amendment and then this and

1293
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,359
the appeals court said when you put file

1294
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,760
sharing software on your computer as the

1295
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,319
owner as the owner as the owner as the

1296
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,240
owner of the computer

1297
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,839
then you've given up your right to

1298
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,839
privacy if that folder is open in the

1299
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:09,200
world that folder is open to the world

1300
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,480
if you open it up in the world you open

1301
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,160
it up to us too

1302
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,000
now that means the fbi the justice

1303
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,839
department for the last 19 years has

1304
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:17,359
been having merry christmas over

1305
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,599
everybody's files all over the country

1306
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:23,680
or the world okay and so they

1307
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,200
um

1308
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,280
hold on just some just happened here all

1309
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,560
right so

1310
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,839
so

1311
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,119
this representation meant that if they

1312
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:33,839
knew

1313
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,480
that my file came from my computer

1314
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,480
instead of foley and science face then

1315
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,720
that's then my fourth amendment right

1316
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,839
would protect me from their

1317
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:43,920
investigation so what they do they

1318
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,599
killed it

1319
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,760
they wiped the metadata from all those

1320
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,680
companies and then put that press

1321
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,359
release out remember that and that was

1322
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,280
so they could start the investigations

1323
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,640
of everyone

1324
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,720
now i would be shocked except now i'm

1325
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,480
jaded but you know

1326
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,960
um so that's the first thing so they can

1327
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,359
start the investigation a harmless

1328
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,040
little thing for justice because all

1329
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,440
they wanted was a consent decree

1330
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,880
so this isn't going to do anything

1331
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,560
anyone really we just have consent

1332
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,000
decrees and then we say what people are

1333
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,079
supposed to do and i'm sorry but no one

1334
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,760
remembers who you are anyway target

1335
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,119
survived tj maxx survived you know just

1336
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,400
go along

1337
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,000
so that's pretty much what's in their

1338
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,119
head

1339
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:24,400
at this point the ftc should have

1340
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,480
investigated diversa but instead they

1341
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,640
told tybersa to strip the metadata off

1342
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:31,440
the files and resubmit them effectively

1343
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,960
removing the file's owner's fourth

1344
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,800
amendment rights falsifying evidence and

1345
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,599
suborning perjury typersa complied and

1346
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,119
the ftc put out a press release

1347
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,440
announcing their starting investigations

1348
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,920
widespread data breaches uncovered mtc

1349
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,040
probe now

1350
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,240
we learned this because when mary beth

1351
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,440
buchanan left brian cave i told rick to

1352
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,240
get his entire legal file sent to him

1353
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,160
and a couple years later he wanted

1354
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,240
information for me we signed an

1355
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:02,000
agreement and he sent that entire brian

1356
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,200
k file

1357
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,240
to me

1358
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,680
now

1359
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,359
you are the owner

1360
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,359
correct richard marshall

1361
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:12,079
of your files in your law firm not them

1362
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:12,839
so

1363
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:13,920
don't think

1364
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,520
meredith mccannon who never calls and

1365
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,960
doesn't send his postcard suddenly

1366
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,280
called up rick and said uh why are you

1367
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,280
getting the files at your ass

1368
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,119
and uh and they were kind of on to her

1369
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,000
so they you know whatever and then

1370
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,280
we got

1371
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,599
he gave up privilege

1372
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,520
um his right to do so

1373
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,040
lawyers could never do this this would

1374
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,119
be unethical for lawyers but he and i

1375
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,400
want to help each other in our cases

1376
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,920
because he was suing

1377
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,400
ty versa in butler county

1378
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,359
so we get this and of course i mean i

1379
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:44,960
don't have time to realize we don't find

1380
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,960
this stuff in here for months

1381
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,200
but anyway so now we're sitting

1382
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,680
so that's the setup as to the first

1383
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,760
strike of corruption okay and that's

1384
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,040
when they just and it wasn't personal

1385
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,720
against me all right

1386
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,040
and the reason i was on that list this

1387
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,680
was testified in the court hearing was

1388
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,440
everyone that was on that list turned

1389
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,680
over to the ftc was basically enemies of

1390
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,079
the ceo people that wouldn't hire him or

1391
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:10,000
fired him i'm going to finish him i'll

1392
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,160
take questions okay

1393
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,839
i bet you the answer is in here i'm

1394
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:15,920
almost done okay

1395
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,400
uh the ftc notified lab mp in lavendy

1396
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,000
spent years under draining and ruinous

1397
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,470
investigation the

1398
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:23,040
[Music]

1399
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:23,599
the 2011 and

1400
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:25,040
for a consent decree and lebanese

1401
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,119
refused the ceo of open began writing a

1402
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,640
book about the unaccountable behavior

1403
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,520
the double-sided beltway in 2012 the mtc

1404
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,760
filed more cids versus labmd and let me

1405
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,920
objected when in court the ftc lied at

1406
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,520
the northern district of georgia via dj

1407
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,640
lawyers covering up the initial

1408
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,240
foundation to investigate what's

1409
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,240
fraudulently created

1410
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,280
so because

1411
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,040
to investigate you must have

1412
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,240
plausibility is you have to if you have

1413
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,040
to

1414
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,520
manipulate data and lie there's no

1415
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,440
plausible reason to investigate and so

1416
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,800
you can't just come in

1417
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,960
the government has so much power

1418
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,000
it's

1419
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,520
they couldn't even get that far off the

1420
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,559
ground

1421
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:01,760
and so

1422
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,839
the 2013 book trailer came out for

1423
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,599
doherty's upcoming book the ftc went to

1424
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,599
the website 75 times in two days

1425
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:08,880
immediately notified dory they were

1426
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,480
proceeding with enforcement action

1427
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,800
dory's book releasing 13 was successful

1428
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,640
the ftc told webmd's during their upset

1429
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,520
blah blah okay this the ftc had never

1430
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,000
adjudicated burglary security violation

1431
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,520
before and did not have the evidence to

1432
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,280
under prosecution so that they are

1433
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,800
fierce with dougherty and lack of dates

1434
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,440
so longer the ftc via now and shared

1435
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,960
contact with diversity again and told

1436
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,359
robert they needed spread so here's the

1437
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,200
second bone now it's personal now it's

1438
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,800
lab md

1439
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,280
versus ftc and i'm the only one they're

1440
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,880
selling

1441
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,319
they don't have victims

1442
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:41,839
they don't have evidence you wanna know

1443
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,240
why nothing happened it's not a lie and

1444
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,119
they know it so now and i'm gonna show

1445
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,559
you that in a second

1446
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:49,680
um

1447
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,559
so they told them well create spread

1448
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:54,880
makeup ip addresses so i'm sitting there

1449
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,040
in the deposition and having this sop

1450
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,359
bob this sociopathic lying piece of crap

1451
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:01,920
say to me and they're going you know um

1452
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,319

1453
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,640

1454
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,000
they're making this up they're on this

1455
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,599
together and this is our first

1456
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,520
deposition ever and of course my lawyer

1457
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,599
of course thinks i'm the crazy courage

1458
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:14,800
person

1459
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,960
i'm the nut bag i'm the control freak

1460
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,559
i'm the emotional one

1461
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:21,760

the uh the ftps

1468
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,520
okay with falsified evidence used to

1469
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,200
start investigations and then more

1470
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,640
created to specifically after lab indeed

1471
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,200
the ftc sued webmd on august 28th first

1472
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,400
and fourth minimum rights were stripped

1473
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,319
as well as any rights to due process one

1474
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:49,520
week later tyversa sued labmd for

1475
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,880
defamation

1476
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,640

00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,720
alan shearer the lead attorney bob had

1479
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,880
purged himself numerous times sheer

1480

support perjury numerous times at the

1481
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,119
time 11d had no idea the entire racket

1482
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:04,640
was to punch level day and destroy it

1483
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,920
for threatened expose they have to see

1484
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,760
in diversity appalling and corrupt

1485
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,760
practices wouldn't even know what they

1486
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,359
did i just knew they were terrified of

1487
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:13,680
me it took this long to figure this out

1488
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,079
in january 14 the cancer detection

1489
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,960
closed its doors and 14 and april 14

1490
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,920
richard waltz contacted la dougherty

1491
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,839
in may 14 the ftc hearing started in

1492
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:25,680
front of the alj which after the ftc

1493
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,160
arrested again supporting perjury from

1494
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,160
the next witness who told them to

1495
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,400
automatically assume the ftc told their

1496
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,359
three

1497
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:35,599
expert witnesses from high powered

1498
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,520
academia all over the united states to

1499
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,760
assume that labmd had bad data security

1500
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,440
practices and the files were on cyber

1501
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,280
space so they didn't have to look and

1502
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,800
they got paid like half million dollars

1503
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,559
for that

1504
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,480
and so the whole thing's a set you get

1505
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,760
that you get so only 2018 and 11d learn

1506
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,200
about the altered evidence because as we

1507
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,359
got the brian k file and then in 19 we

1508
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,440
got the testimony i just read you

1509
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,319
so that's how we learned about us so

1510
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:01,760
here we are today

1511
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,680
so um

1512
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,559
so in these notes from here there's this

1513
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:08,480
five page of notes that i'm just showing

1514
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,880
we have the written evidence

1515
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:11,910
from um

1516
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:13,040
[Music]

1517
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:13,920
from

1518
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,520
from this case and that is that's from

1519
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,760
wallace's attorneys and wallace's

1520
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,480
interview and that is absolutely to be

1521
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,520
relied upon in court now so now we just

1522
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,079
sued and i'm almost done we just sued

1523
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,240
the ftc and the federal

1524
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,200
torts claims act which is this i mean

1525
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,800
they've got so much race to screw over

1526
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,960
you have no idea and and and they're so

1527
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,599
hard to get them but we still have them

1528
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:40,720
and so

1529
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,240
we've sued in northern district of

1530
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,720
georgia it's really hard to find a

1531
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,200
lawyer that wants to take on these guys

1532
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:51,599
really hard big law is not interested

1533
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,480
um because it's all interwoven you know

1534
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,359
they leave the agency they go work for

1535
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:59,920
the big law firm the law firm has access

1536
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,319
to clients in the agency and if y'all

1537
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,160

1538
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,280
fine

1539
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,559
which question

1540
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:09,440
uh what was the discovery of the fbi

1541
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,760
rate of diversity oh i'm so glad you

1542
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,359
brought that up sorry i can't fit

1543
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:15,119
everything in an hour

1544
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:15,839
uh

1545
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:19,359
i was in london at science and i was in

1546
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:20,400
uh

1547
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,200
and

1548
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,520
i was at the the

1549
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,480
virgin atlantic lounge at heathrow

1550
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,119
yelling at the fbi investigator when he

1551
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:30,839
informed me that they closed the

1552
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,599
investigation they couldn't prove that

1553
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:36,640
bobby knew and i mean it was just i was

1554
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,440
like

1555
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,599
jeffy's name's john too i was like john

1556
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:42,160
quit bullshitting me there's no way in

1557
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,800
hell but i said i understand you can't

1558
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,359
tell me the truth i understand you can't

1559
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,359
say this i i really was off the chain i

1560
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:50,559
was yelling

1561
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,599
and but but bottom line is i started

1562
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,920
getting anonymous emails from proton

1563
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,839
mail telling me that all this is going

1564
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:58,800
down

1565
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,559
and we are still trying to get discovery

1566
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:02,800
to figure out who sent that stuff we've

1567
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,800
hired international law firms in

1568
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,480
switzerland to try to get this out of

1569
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,960
protonmail because this whole thing is

1570
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,960
it's unbelievable and it turned out that

1571
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,640
the bottom line is the fbi the fbi works

1572
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,480
each city's like a different

1573
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,240
vertical and

1574
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,520
dc initially went tearing in there and

1575
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,599
they opened the casket and they went oh

1576
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,760
my god gunk

1577
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,160
because what they discovered is what i

1578
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,160
discovered later which is

1579
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:30,880
the

1580
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,240
ghj and the fbi was the co-conspirator

1581
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,400
to steal these files from thousands of

1582
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,680
corporations

1583
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,800
because

1584
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,079
they're the ones that gave them the

1585
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:42,559
weapon it it is it's the fast and fears

1586
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,640
of cyber security

1587
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,880
so therefore they can't prosecute them

1588
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,400
because they're the co-conspirator so

1589
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,800
any defense lawyers can say excuse me we

1590
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,000
have a primary who's bringing the

1591
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,359
charges

1592
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:55,760
yes can you prove that with a foia

1593
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:57,760
i've got it proven already here

1594
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,079
wow i mean all these articles all these

1595
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:02,400
notes all these witnesses and some voice

1596
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,559
stuff but i've got i've got testimony

1597
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:06,000
i've got the name

1598
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,559
we we know

1599
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:10,559
so i mean what happens is

1600
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:13,200
you have i mean we we don't have hearsay

1601
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,079
we have written documents from lawyers

1602
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,640
who used to be a former us attorney and

1603
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,280
her associate stating what went on in

1604
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,160
their interview with richard wallace so

1605
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,000
now we have to get an article three

1606
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,480
court to open up more discovery and i

1607
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,280
will tell you it will take a long time

1608
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,240
because

1609
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,079
the government doesn't like having its

1610
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:36,480
dirty laundry exposed but yeah we can

1611
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,400
prove it right there so are you done are

1612
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,640
you good now we're just starting so how

1613
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:41,680
much longer do you think this is going

1614
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,119
to take

1615
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:44,319
10 more years

1616
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:45,839
it's not the point the story is the

1617
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:46,720
point

1618
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,440
i mean the point about this is the this

1619
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,280
is how they roll

1620
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,559
and and so is the bigger picture but so

1621
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:56,319
so um i mean i don't it depends on what

1622
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:58,480
judge you get you know i mean look if

1623
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,200
you read the ruling from um of the 11th

1624
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,480
circuit on award-winning hundred

1625
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,760
thousand dollars

1626
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,520
you know usually lawyers are like

1627
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,520
objective corpses nothing gets them

1628
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,480
excited

1629
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,680
nothing because emotion no no no emotion

1630
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,079
you know and and they know that this

1631
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:15,440
really is about justice but they're not

1632
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,640
going to tell you that because you why

1633
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,880
would you be there and so

1634
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,720
it was fascinating to me because when

1635
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,200
judge joe flatt did that normal argument

1636
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,440
and when they came out with that ruling

1637
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,000
they were so animated with things like

1638
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,599
you never see this this never happens

1639
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:31,440
this is unbelievable these are these koi

1640
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,960
supreme court guys i mean ropes are

1641
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,440
great it's a phenomenal job i mean they

1642
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,359
brought in tons of people they were

1643
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:38,799
incredible for working pro bono they

1644
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:40,960
were unbelievable and it was like i was

1645
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,640
paying them all tons of money they were

1646
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,119
so on it and and they were it was a

1647
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:46,880
great observation of watch

1648
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,559
i'm usually the one they're concerned

1649
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:51,280
about being emotional and but i'm i'm

1650
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,200
when i'm on i'm on i would not i would

1651
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,040
not be a successful

1652
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,640
you know entrepreneur with surgeons

1653
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,640
dealing with cancer if i was you know

1654
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,400
had a reputation of always flipping out

1655
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,400
my reputation is i have no

1656
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,760
and so when you're in trouble guess who

1657
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,799
you call

1658
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:07,520
but um and that rubs people some people

1659
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:10,319
the wrong way but as far as that was i

1660
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:12,880
was i was in the courtroom just like an

1661
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,240
iceman and

1662
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,520
mr iceman's like elbowing me going

1663
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,520
so the point is

1664
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,359
you know again

1665
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:22,960
i wrote this

1666
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,280
because the story has to be told this is

1667
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,520
how they roll regardless of whether we

1668
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,640
win or not

1669
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,480
okay now um go ahead yeah what's the

1670
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,480
name of it again oh

1671
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,240

1672

it

1677
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,040

anyway does anybody else have any

1681
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,160
questions

1682
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,479
yes

1683
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,960
so

1684
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:03,179
[Music]

1685
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:04,640
yeah

1686
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,599
you

1687
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:08,240
you selected the middle finger for the

1688
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,640
judicial branch was that intentional or

1689
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,640
subliminal

1690
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:15,680
it was a test

1691
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,359
and i owe you a cocktail

1692
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,720
let me see did i do that hold on i

1693
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,559
actually let me tell you something i

1694
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:25,839
have very missed emotions about the

1695
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:27,760
judicial plans because there's nothing

1696
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,280
better and nothing saves you more than

1697
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,359
if you get a great judge

1698
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:33,680
i mean judge cho flat was just i mean

1699
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,079
the second they announced my panel by

1700
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:38,240
this time i was so deep in law and

1701
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,839
technology i have a lot of friends at

1702
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:41,599
the top that i mean it used to be all my

1703
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:42,799
friends for surgeons remember the

1704
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:44,960
godfather when diane king goes he hangs

1705
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,400
around with your thugs and i was like

1706
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,839
that's my life now all i do is hang

1707
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,680
around with lawyers and

1708
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,920
attack people but that paid off because

1709
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,079
when i got that judge my phone was like

1710
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:55,520
did i get people i used to clerk with

1711
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:58,000
him because i mean he was 88 he's now 92

1712
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,440
he's still incredible he took senior

1713
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,680
status but they're like he reads

1714
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,079
everything he doesn't trust anybody he

1715
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:05,839
reads the whole thing and when we walked

1716
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:07,760
out of oral argument

1717
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,079
gross and gray and this is true

1718
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:12,559
um they said holy cow he's read more

1719
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:14,240
than we briefed

1720
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,920
he got into all the corruption they

1721
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,680
would brief the corruption because i

1722
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,760
didn't have i mean this is 2016. i

1723
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,160
didn't have what i got 18 and 19. you

1724
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,200
know and

1725
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,839
these people are just like white gloves

1726
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:27,680
i mean i'm sorry i mean

1727
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,359
you're the planer for the defendant

1728
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:31,599
please just sit there and shut up

1729
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:33,440
so um so

1730
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,359
it's a double-edged sword because i've

1731
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:37,119
got all sorts of terrible things about

1732
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:38,400
to say about you know the western

1733
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,440
district of pennsylvania

1734
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,119
and i have all sorts of lawyers that

1735
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,359
have told me what a swamp that district

1736
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:47,520
is and especially the state level and

1737
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,280
you get in and you see it that's a whole

1738
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,119
nother thing i wanna do after i've got

1739
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:53,200
like four more books of me because

1740
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,599
i don't want to rail against it you just

1741
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:58,240
have to understand it in case the tree

1742
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,400
falls down on you and you get stuck in

1743
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,359
it and most people get stuck in it

1744
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:05,599
in family law

1745
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,319
most citizens but it's it's really it's

1746
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:10,480
it's basically i say that judges are

1747
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:12,319
only can be are allowed to be as good as

1748
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:13,520
their mother raised them because there's

1749
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,119
really no accountability

1750
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:16,400
and i've talked to a lot of people that

1751
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,480
are i mean brilliant attorneys you know

1752
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,160
and judges scott and stick circular

1753
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,599
because they were nobody said he like

1754
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,440
has the entire founding fathers memories

1755
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,359
and he's like the founding fathers knew

1756
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:26,799
they gave so much centralized power to

1757
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:28,480
the judiciary but they planned on that

1758
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,160
because they said judges were going to

1759
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,640
hold each other accountable

1760
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,480
i'm sorry so

1761
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,160
i guess you know they're not holding

1762
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,079
each other accountable

1763
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:39,920
they're just they're muslim passing in

1764
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,000
graveyard you know and so they all know

1765
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,359
just like with surgeons they don't know

1766
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:45,599
who's hacking people up in town they're

1767
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,680
fixing all their mistakes

1768
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,680
so that's why it's like my expectations

1769
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,680
are not i'm going to sue i want to get

1770
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,680
to discovery i want to show how much

1771
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,280
they fight back i want to show this as

1772
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,559
year 10.

1773
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,079
you know i want to show it i mean this

1774
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,400
is they can't really come at me because

1775
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,400
i mean they can but they would have by

1776
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,200
now

1777
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,760
i mean we diagnosed cancer and we have

1778
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,720
um you know um

1779
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:09,520
i mean

1780
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,599
four weeks before we closed we had our

1781
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:13,760
last inspection it was a perfect score

1782
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:14,960
what are they going to do they usually

1783
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,960
go looking for you know but we're such

1784
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,880
terrible people diagnosing cancer go get

1785
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:19,839
them

1786
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:20,640
so

1787
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,720
you know and so so it's the rear view

1788
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,280
mirror is very satisfying now but it's

1789
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,200
ironic that people like i mean good

1790
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,640
friends of mine over here that we talk

1791
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,480
and they say this morning right are you

1792
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,880
done and i went we're just starting the

1793
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,200
plane of work is just starting because i

1794
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,599
just learned what happened recently yes

1795
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:39,119
so

1796
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:42,880
my question is what is the

1797
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,400
sales people

1798
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,920
and to tell them

1799
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,599
you never know what's going to happen

1800
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:00,880
but nothing will happen if you don't get

1801
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,960
out there and make something happen okay

1802
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,720
so that's true about this i mean do you

1803
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,880
think in 2000 look like in the big 2014

1804
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,960
if i would have said a whistleblower is

1805
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,319
going to come out because my book get

1806
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:12,160
released dear license going to read it

1807
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,240
and have this big old visceral reaction

1808
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,280
we're going to start a congressional

1809
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,799
investigation i'm going to be testifying

1810
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:18,960
about the entire house oversight panel

1811
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,480
which the media is going to completely

1812
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,000
ignore because they're still in the bag

1813
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,200
with the left and i mean

1814
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,440
but in the rearview mirror it's crazy so

1815
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,280
i don't know what's coming you know and

1816
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,359
but but that's what makes it you know i

1817
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:33,200
mean

1818
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:36,480
it's you know i'm

1819
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,520
i have money i have freedom but i'm not

1820
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,599
about that as success i find it

1821
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:43,359
important to have an interesting life is

1822
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:45,599
really a successful life so this has

1823
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,960
been terrible

1824
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,359
but it's also been fascinating you know

1825
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:50,880
i just can't you know so so what i have

1826
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,960
done for myself now is i've opened i

1827
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,880
really learned i hated being just in

1828
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,960
tech or law because i'm not a tech

1829
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,559
person i'm not a lot of person so no one

1830
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:00,480
around here really would treat me like i

1831
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,240
had any knowledge whatsoever

1832
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,079
because i was just i just dropped out of

1833
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:06,400
nowhere that got really annoying

1834
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,760
you know it's like suddenly go from

1835
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,599
being a respected business person that

1836
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:11,200
diagnoses cancer people and helps them

1837
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,039
in their medical practice to who the

1838
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:14,799
hell are you you stupid idiot with a big

1839
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:17,359
mouth that was the worst part so i went

1840
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,839
back and opened my own lab again and i

1841
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:22,000
moved to virginia and that's like there

1842
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
but i've also opened the justice society

1843
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,240
which is now my passion which is it was

1844
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,720
just starts at the justice site.com it's

1845
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:31,520
we trained davis to defeat goliaths and

1846
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:32,720
we are

1847
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:35,839
half litigation and half education

1848
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:37,839
because the big thing is

1849
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:40,160
i mean i feel like

1850
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,160
i'm a pretty well educated guy with a

1851
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,720
very kind of unusual upbringing and i

1852
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,200
didn't know and people need to

1853
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,039
understand this

1854
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:51,039
and and understand this is how this

1855
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:53,680
government rolls it's pretty late

1856
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,200
you know and there's a lot more to say

1857
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:59,039
but it's 304 so that's that's it

1858
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:02,540
but thank you very much

1859
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:07,029
