1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,280
so today we're going to talk

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,359
a little bit about performance-based

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,680
cyber security and

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,800
let me uh get this microphone going

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,599
are there folks online do you know

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,119
is it just us

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,600
can you guys hear me okay

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,520
do we need this

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,600
awesome

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,240
i feel like i'm on american idol so

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,320
it makes me a little more nervous

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,400
i'm george simons i'm with the

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,079
international critical infrastructure

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,920
security institute

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,760
and today we're going to talk about

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,680
performance-based cyber

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,239
but we are a very small group so let's

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,559
let's make this intimate you know ask

19
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,879
questions or whatnot or like like a

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,120
discussion

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,000
um

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,600
i'll preface everything before we get

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,559
started with saying as a non-profit

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,559
focusing on training and

25
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,039
workforce development or what have you

26
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,039
2020 was a blur

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,359
we had no acting projects going on for

28
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,680
training we were doing we were basically

29
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,119
a think tank at that particular stage

30
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,680
and what happened in 2020 was this

31
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,320
opportunity to kind of inflect figure

32
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,479
out what is it going to look like over

33
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,560
the next five years or 10 years or

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,880
whatever the case may be

35
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,960
so around a campfire with a bunch of

36
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,119
buddies you know sipping on bourbon and

37
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,880
smoking cigars we were talking

38
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,159
is

39
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,519
[Music]

40
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,040
so for those who may not have heard

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,960
george simon's international critical

42
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,360
infrastructure security institute

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,880
um

44
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,880
so we had an opportunity to sit around

45
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,159
and talk about

46
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,799
uh kind of where things are and you know

47
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,399
we're kind of old salts as you'll see i

48
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,920
got a lot of gray in my hair i've been

49
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,840
doing this a long time

50
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,320
worked in a lot of different industries

51
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,038
especially with the focus on cyber

52
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,878
and then we have and we were invited out

53
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,200
to do a couple of special projects in

54
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,160
some remote parts of the world and

55
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,120
uh

56
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,480
and as a result

57
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,800
we kind of changed the way we were

58
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,879
our thought process of the way we were

59
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:23,840
thinking and that's what we're going to

60
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,720
talk about today

61
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,840
what's changing in ice city

62
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,040
again i says he's a non-profit it's a

63
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,800
501c6 it's member based

64
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,280
we don't actively recruit for membership

65
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,800
it's more of a

66
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,200
opportunity to collaborate and join with

67
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,319
uh you know a very tight-knit group of

68
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,440
folks who

69
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,720
are really just trying to make the world

70
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,000
a better place

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,160
and we come from all over a lot of

72
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,239
critical infrastructure

73
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,720
of course dod and federal

74
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,640
but we focus primarily on critical

75
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,400
infrastructure

76
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,360
this all started back in 2015 when we

77
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,120
were rolling out cyber security for

78
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,040
commercial nuclear energy

79
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,720
and they were in the process of trying

80
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,000
to convert

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,480
their cyber defenses

82
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,319
strategies if you will

83
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,200
into more of us

84
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,519
a nist based standards standards-based

85
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,400
approach

86
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,080
so kind of taking it from the early

87
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,920
aughts of 2000

88
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,360
into uh

89
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,200
like at that time nist was publishing

90
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,920
882 which was an industrial control

91
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,959
cyber

92
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,959
so kind of modernizing their approach to

93
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,080
cyber security there were so many issues

94
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,000
involved in negotiating what it's going

95
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,239
to take to protect a commercial nuclear

96
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,480
power facility we started this

97
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,640
non-profit to focus on workforce

98
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,760
development

99
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,560
and also on research

100
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,319
the research was focused on

101
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,000
really bringing together

102
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,280
engineering

103
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,319
all the dif we call it

104
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,840
multi-disciplinary all the different

105
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,120
disciplines

106
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,760
um anecdotally i was at a large

107
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,959
university uh around the capital beltway

108
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,159
in dc

109
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,760
we were talking about some of the issues

110
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,280
we were facing

111
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,400
and so we had all the different

112
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,640
departments we had computer sciences we

113
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,400
had you know engineering

114
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,879
we had

115
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,600
the group from the law school and

116
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,440
everyone around us

117
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,960
and no one would look at each other and

118
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,280
nobody would talk to each other

119
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,800
and then if i came out of that

120
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,560
environment and i stepped out and i was

121
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,080
interfacing with industry it was the

122
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,080
same way and if i stepped into the

123
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,520
regulatory agency it was the same way

124
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,520
everyone had a piece of the puzzle but

125
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,520
nobody was in the same room together

126
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,440
wanting to put a puzzle together

127
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,960
so we're going to talk today a little

128
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,800
bit about the boy now a lot of you are

129
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,560
cyber experts

130
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,240
and i get that you've been doing this

131
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,240
probably a long time

132
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,000
so wait

133
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,199
but there's

134
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,479
there's a way we got to change the

135
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,759
our our our understanding of the cyber

136
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,400
threat and what we're calling the void

137
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,479
in order to kind of push us into the

138
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,520
next level in our industry and that's

139
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,120
what we were talking about around this

140
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,039
campfire and whenever we were

141
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,600
pre-deploying to go overseas to to work

142
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,560
with these customers

143
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,280
you know i'm not an astrophysicist and i

144
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,160
don't know a lot about space but there

145
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,080
were these researchers in the u.s and

146
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,800
germany and italy and france

147
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,840
and what they found was that you know

148
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,919
you know every you know matter in space

149
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,840
is in a constant you know

150
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,360
state of movement

151
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,199
and we're part of the milkingway galaxy

152
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,160
right

153
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,240
and right now the earth in the milky way

154
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,080
is essentially moving in about 600

155
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,080
kilometers a second

156
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,320
so what's pushing this matter in space

157
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,160
what's propelling it

158
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,520
and what they found is that there are

159
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,400
these voids in space

160
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,160
these voids that hold a tremendous

161
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,400
amount of dark energy

162
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,160
and this dark energy is essentially

163
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,360
repelling

164
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,720
and pushing

165
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,560
everything away and that's taking the

166
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,120
matter around it and pushing

167
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,800
that matter further and further away

168
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,000
this is what contributes to the

169
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,400
expansion of space this is why space is

170
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,800
constantly expanding

171
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,400
what was interesting is they had these

172
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,319
models in these simulations where they

173
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,800
would try to measure and understand

174
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,360
known matter in the universe

175
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,759
so if we have matter out in space we

176
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,280
want to measure it

177
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,280
there are ways to do that

178
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,120
but what they found was that they

179
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,759
incorporated

180
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,240
a measurement of these voids the energy

181
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,160
inside these voids

182
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,919
the precision

183
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,759
of measuring matter in space and

184
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,840
understanding matter space was four

185
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,400
times more accurate

186
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
so they switched it to begin

187
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,240
incorporating into their their their

188
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,479
models and evaluation and an

189
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,199
understanding of how these voids work

190
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,080
and that's a lot like how we what

191
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,800
we face in cyber right now

192
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,520
we know there's a threat out there

193
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,000
we've got bits and pieces of data we've

194
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
got things that are kind of

195
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,160
just generally understood about this

196
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,599
threat

197
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,360
but at the same time there's a lot that

198
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,520
we don't know

199
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,520
and we don't really spend a lot of time

200
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,759
measuring how well we perform in our

201
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,360
jobs or in our roles with the

202
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,440
technologies we buy or we implement or

203
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,880
rebuild

204
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,560
based upon what the threat's really

205
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,440
doing

206
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,560
what the threat's really capable of

207
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,240
and this is a metric that's proven at

208
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,560
this point i'm going to show it to you

209
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,560
the government understand this

210
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,960
we all kind of understand it so how do

211
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,639
we get past that

212
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,440
i mean i've been doing this for 30 years

213
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,240
the same problems we had 30 years ago

214
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,720
are the same problems we have today

215
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,639
and so what that tells me if i were a

216
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,680
scientist

217
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,879
i am measuring matter and space

218
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,960
but what i'm not using is an

219
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,199
understanding of this void

220
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,360
to be able to you know measure these

221
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,479
things more accurately

222
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,599
when i was working with this small

223
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:08,639
country

224
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,199
in eastern europe

225
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,479
when you talk about

226
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,240
i mean we're in the

227
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,680
we have a little running joke in our

228
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,280
family i forget where movie it comes

229
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,400
from

230
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,560
we're in central america the center of

231
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,160
america

232
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,039
we are we're in a really in a pocket of

233
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,960
luxury when it comes to the way we live

234
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,720
in our lifestyles and everything happens

235
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,000
as a culture

236
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,360
when you travel to other parts of the

237
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,399
world

238
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,640
they have contended borders

239
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,039
they have nation states that at every

240
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,479
moment is

241
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,159
breathing down their neck every day is a

242
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,760
decision about whether my culture

243
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,880
survives

244
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,880
or my culture dies

245
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,959
whether i'm going to be forced to fight

246
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,399
or whether i'm going to be able to just

247
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,120
have dinner tonight with my kids

248
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,120
so we talked about the tsunami effect

249
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,720
you say look

250
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,920
this void this dark energy this

251
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,080
cyber threat or whatnot is going to be

252
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,560
paying attention to what you're doing

253
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,800
and as they pay attention anything that

254
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,279
you implement or do

255
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,040
to make things better

256
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,360
is essentially going to increase their

257
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,640
efforts in other words you're going to

258
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,640
see a heightened level of activity on

259
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,160
the threat domain

260
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,680
as you try to

261
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,720
address it internally within your

262
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,640
government critical infrastructure

263
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,480
wherever it might be

264
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,560
we call it the tsunami effect

265
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,399
you won't see it but it's coming

266
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,080
i swear this graphic was around 20 years

267
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,040
ago i pulled this out of the 2018 g.a.o

268
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,120
before

269
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,959
show a handset who has not seen the

270
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,120
iceberg and then uh

271
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,880
you know

272
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,720
emulation of the cyrus

273
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,320
we all have right

274
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,640
first thing

275
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,600
essentially the concept is look what we

276
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,200
know is above the service and what we

277
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,959
don't know is below the surface there's

278
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,120
so much that we don't know it's just

279
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,200
general recognition that when it comes

280
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,880
to the threat there's a lot of things

281
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,720
that we don't understand

282
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,040
we still don't understand

283
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,920
but

284
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,920
all of the activities that we're doing

285
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,000
all the stuff that you know defines our

286
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,040
daily lives our job descriptions are

287
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,880
you know the nice program out of this

288
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,560
but we're trying to say hey here's all

289
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,320
the different roles in cyber that have

290
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,519
to be filled

291
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,519
all of those are being basically focused

292
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,160
at the top of this iceberg what's going

293
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,839
on below it

294
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,640
are we spending enough time figuring out

295
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,120
what's really below the surface

296
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,800
i'm going to use weapon systems as an

297
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,079
example

298
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,600
i'm a nuke guy

299
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,240
right so i work out a commercial

300
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,920
nuclear energy

301
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,760
but i find this fascinating because what

302
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,800
i've learned

303
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,480
over the course of my career

304
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,440
is that it's all kind of the same

305
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,200
whether you're in a nuclear power plant

306
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,399
a oil burner and you're working out of

307
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,120
a refinery or you're at a fossil

308
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,600
generation plant

309
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,680
building automation whatever it might be

310
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,560
in this case a weapon system

311
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,040
there is this kind of

312
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,880
growing understanding of the fact that

313
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,959
the diversity of the technology we work

314
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,880
with has expanded

315
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,640
just like matters

316
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,320
space is expanding matters moving

317
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,079
through the universe

318
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,360
same thing is happening at the

319
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,959
technology front

320
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,480
weapon systems

321
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,040
they are a combination of it

322
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,160
ot

323
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,680
operational technology meaning

324
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,800
industrial control can bus profibus

325
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,839
modbus all these protocols that are

326
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,200
um

327
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,000
asymmetrical to what most tools on the

328
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,760
on the planet are currently capable of

329
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,000
even looking at our understanding how

330
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,839
they communicate

331
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,120
kid you know

332
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,680
if you were to walk into some facilities

333
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,160
in the u.s that are responsible for

334
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,560
producing bulk load on the grid

335
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,320
they might not even be able to tell you

336
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,480
what all is there

337
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,959
what all is communicating how is it

338
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,120
communicating where are those packets

339
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,959
going

340
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,560
and then there's this idea well you know

341
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,079
what it doesn't matter because they're

342
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,719
air gaps

343
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,440
we got systems that are air so yeah it's

344
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,600
a it's a blended model we got everything

345
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,480
integrated together but it's okay

346
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,000
these things are separate they're not

347
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,760
touching the internet

348
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,760
we have we used to call it the hard

349
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,959
outer shell of soft

350
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,360
so essentially we can have this device

351
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,600
we can have this component and we don't

352
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,720
have to worry about it because we're

353
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,760
just going to build a motor around

354
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,680
what i tried to explain to the industry

355
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,440
at the time was that there is no such

356
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,440
thing as isolation

357
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,720
there is no such thing as air at

358
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,320
and the reason for that is because data

359
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,360
is always moving it's moving somehow

360
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,959
well these systems are

361
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,839
behind 18 layers of physical security

362
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,240
they're behind you know

363
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,240
they're deep in the plant you have to

364
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,480
have all these different special access

365
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,399
requirements just to get to them they're

366
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,160
not connected to anything

367
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,440
they're literally

368
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,279
basically what they call you

369
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,680
run and die systems

370
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,200
we install them you turn them on you

371
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,399
make sure they're configured and you

372
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,079
walk away from them you pray they don't

373
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,399
break

374
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,240
until the vendor has to come in and

375
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,639
modify

376
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,160
until they have to go in there and pull

377
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,320
data off of it because the logs aren't

378
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,680
right

379
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,519
or because they're having an

380
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,360
anomaly behavior in the control room

381
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,800
that's saying hey this thing is giving

382
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,639
me the parameters for changing i need to

383
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,399
see what's going on

384
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,160
digital instrument instrumentation and

385
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,680
control has to go out there and look at

386
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,680
it maintenance has to look at it and

387
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,680
they're hooking stuff up to it

388
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,720
it's no longer air gapped

389
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,199
and in 2018

390
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,320
when they were looking at a weapon

391
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,040
system and it could it could be power

392
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,199
generation or anything else

393
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,639
they found that they had all these

394
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,040
issues

395
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,440
and again this is 20 years after i

396
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,560
started and it's the same list of issues

397
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,440
that have been going on forever

398
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,600
they're susceptible to man-to-metal

399
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,800
attacks

400
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,040
ddos and so on and so forth they have

401
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,360
zero to little

402
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,760
what i call situational awareness of

403
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,560
what's really going on

404
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,839
and then what we end up doing is

405
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,279
interfacing with all these different

406
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,560
vendors and trying to figure out hey

407
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,399
what do i do and the vendors are coming

408
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,240
and saying i solve

409
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,959
this problem

410
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,440
it's like walking onto the beach i mean

411
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,480
how many

412
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,199
pieces of sand in the sea are there or

413
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,760
picking up a handful of sand and saying

414
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,399
i can fix that problem like all this

415
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,959
other stuff going on

416
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,880
it just amazes me that we're this far

417
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,160
along

418
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,959
this these many decades beyond where we

419
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:49,839
were

420
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,440
and we're really not making much

421
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,959
progress

422
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,880
in fact the gao said that if you were to

423
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,680
take the crawl walk run

424
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,079
analysis we're still in the crawling

425
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,760
stage

426
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,440
so from a cyber perspective we're

427
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,519
basically a 40 year old infant

428
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,040
and so as a non-profit we get to sit

429
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,920
around and talk and think about well how

430
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,560
do we change that how do we

431
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,560
how do we turn that around how do we go

432
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,920
from a crawl to a to maybe a

433
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,360
the beginning of a walk maybe it's a

434
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,839
wobbly walk but how do we move forward

435
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,880
and this was part of the problem here

436
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,600
it didn't even take

437
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,800
that high of a level of sophistication

438
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,279
to break into these systems

439
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,040
when you know the intel community

440
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,759
especially the usa the dod now they have

441
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,519
these programs where we're training red

442
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,959
team operators

443
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,720
we're really you know working towards

444
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,639
more on the pin test side being able to

445
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,839
offensively go and test these

446
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,600
systems but what is the real level of

447
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,519
rigor

448
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,519
once you get past that hard outer shell

449
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,480
it is a soft gooey center

450
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,959
and that's a massive problem now in this

451
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,720
case it's weapon systems i don't know if

452
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,320
you guys care about weapon systems all

453
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,480
that much but the people on in theater

454
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,560
do

455
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,320
but i'm sure certainly all about you

456
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,199
guys but i love power

457
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,120
i love having lights on

458
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,839
and i brought my gaming

459
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,279
laptop you know i could be in the hotel

460
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,720
room you know

461
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,680
playing division right now on steam

462
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,759
i love power

463
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,240
if these systems are vulnerable it

464
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,000
certainly affects our lives and we hear

465
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,560
that over and over and over again and

466
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,839
how is that how can we keep hearing

467
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,399
that this is a problem and we're not

468
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,800
moving forward fast enough

469
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,240
these are the things that keep us awake

470
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,199
again same things out of the gao report

471
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,839
again metrics that are proven

472
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,759
i don't have to convince you it's done

473
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,279
we all understand that this is where it

474
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,800
is the question is how to move

475
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,199
this is what i think is the fundamental

476
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,720
problem

477
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,559
when i ran teams of analysts that would

478
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,799
go into a federal facility to run and do

479
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,359
assessments um

480
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,199
basically they were it's a checklist

481
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,959
process

482
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,559
and i had an opportunity

483
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,199
uh being around the beltway to work

484
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,799
closely with some of the folks out of

485
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,439
nist who were the developers of

486
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,039
the cyber security framework that just

487
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,720
about everything is derived from these

488
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,919
days

489
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:30,880
and we were talking about

490
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,039
performance-based cybersecurity because

491
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,880
in the nuclear sector the regulation is

492
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,799
performance-based which is i don't care

493
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,640
how you get to the end result but the

494
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,200
end result should be proven

495
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,960
and i said i'm having a problem because

496
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,880
i can't do that with nist i can't do

497
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,240
that with these standards because i

498
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,919
can't prove at the end of the day that

499
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,840
they're actually working

500
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,799
i walk into a facility and i say show me

501
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,039
where you spent all your money on cyber

502
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,200
and they will roll in

503
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,600
boxes of paper

504
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,280
that's where it all went millions of

505
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,120
dollars towards analysts

506
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,120
going out there and compiling reviews

507
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,799
and figuring out what the status of

508
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,160
things are

509
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,480
but what are you actually doing

510
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,400
to protect the threat

511
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,240
what technology are you adopting how do

512
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,720
you know what's doing the right thing

513
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,000
and this guy said something to me that

514
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,400
stuck with me he said

515
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,880
it was a performance-based model

516
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,919
until the lawyers got involved

517
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,360
and so a vast majority of my career has

518
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,200
been convincing people to adopt

519
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,799
frameworks that at the end of the day

520
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,960
provide very little value now i want to

521
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,799
say it doesn't mean that these

522
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,520
frameworks have no value

523
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,200
it just means that the way we deliver

524
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,280
them doesn't produce

525
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,120
real value in most cases

526
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,160
and over beers i'll share a lot of

527
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,720
stories about that

528
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,240
this is all across critical

529
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,880
infrastructure

530
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,080
we have

531
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,360
this

532
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,799
we have amassed so much information

533
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:09,760
about

534
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,480
how to go solve the problem

535
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,720
without really understanding what the

536
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,280
problem really is

537
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,360
what we don't understand is the root

538
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,559
cause

539
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,360
what is the root cause

540
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,720
is there anyone here who could tell me

541
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,160
what they think i mean by root cause

542
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,799
what is that

543
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,200
what's that

544
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,840
where it started that's good anyone else

545
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,440
exactly is the starting point

546
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,520
a friend of mine and we make fun of him

547
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,679
all the time because he uses this term

548
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,360
about everything usually because he

549
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,799
attributes cyber to just about

550
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,159
everything chess

551
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,520
but he calls it the fundamentals

552
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,679
what is the fundamental thing we're

553
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,480
trying to fix

554
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,480
and when i inundate someone with a bunch

555
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,480
of requirements

556
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,200
it's no it's no

557
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,960
it's a no-brainer why that it's not

558
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,559
really taking it very far because

559
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,480
they're just based the requirement is

560
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,080
the problem

561
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,120
the requirement is the root cause

562
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,960
i used to say look

563
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,919
first year government agency goes into

564
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,039
business

565
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,200
this is about how thick their procedures

566
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,039
would be

567
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,039
after about 50 years of being in

568
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,919
business it's going to be volumes

569
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,159
because every mistake someone made

570
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,240
resulted in a change to the policy or

571
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,520
the requirement

572
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,120
right

573
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,120
well these requirements that we work off

574
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,960
of are nothing more than

575
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,960
than a collection of mistakes that we've

576
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,559
recognized or issues that we've

577
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,360
recognized but we've lost sight of where

578
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,480
they came from

579
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,000
and right now across the critical

580
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,720
infrastructure

581
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,080
they're not working

582
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,840
again it doesn't mean that they're wrong

583
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,840
it just means they're not working

584
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,240
and that's because our understanding of

585
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,919
the root cause

586
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,120
is

587
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,600
amateur at best

588
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,440
and i am very guilty of that

589
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,600
30 years in the industry

590
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,760
and what do i really know

591
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,720
about this threat

592
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,280
and andrew carnegie said look i don't

593
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,360
have to be the smartest guy i just have

594
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,720
to be in the room with the smartest

595
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,320
people

596
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,240
and that's what this non-profit was

597
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,159
about

598
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,080
so i got a room in the room of the

599
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,679
smartest people

600
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,840
people who were

601
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,919
essentially dedicated their lives to

602
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,520
understanding this thing

603
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,919
most

604
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,000
most people in our industry would

605
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,320
understand the threat purely based off

606
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,000
of the attributes and characteristics

607
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,440
that are published through these

608
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,600
standards

609
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
some cases we might have a more moderate

610
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,679
understanding of it because we're on the

611
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,200
front lines we're in a security

612
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,960
operations center we're seeing the

613
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,400
vulnerabilities coming through we're

614
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,640
looking at the active attacks

615
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,200
whatever the case might be

616
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,640
but if you look at the tip of the

617
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,960
iceberg when it comes to workforce i

618
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,360
call it the top 1

619
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,600
the top 1 of our field

620
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,919
who are actively engaging the adversary

621
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,720
on the wire

622
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,840
and these are typically special programs

623
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,039
they're going to be in the intel

624
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,840
community and they're going to be in the

625
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,120
um

626
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,200
federal dod community

627
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,039
and then an even smaller sliver of that

628
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,159
out in

629
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,280
you know

630
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,159
in the commercial space

631
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,200
but when

632
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,120
when you sit down with these individuals

633
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,679
who have had that level of exposure you

634
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,919
begin to realize

635
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,320
that their view of the world is very

636
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,480
different from the rest of us and by us

637
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,080
including us all

638
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,559
in the cyber industry because they see

639
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,799
it differently their experience is

640
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,240
different

641
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,080
so my question to them was well what

642
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,639
would you do differently

643
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,200
we already go

644
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,960
my one friend said

645
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,559
look i don't even have to prove to you

646
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,360
that this whole thing is broken

647
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,000
that has been proven over and over and

648
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,480
over again

649
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,559
but still how do we fix it how do we get

650
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,080
to the place where we can understand

651
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,840
this root cause better

652
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,000
and move forward

653
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,360
until the lawyers get involved

654
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,760
so let's talk about performance based

655
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,080
this is an evolution of my understanding

656
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,600
of what performance based should really

657
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,200
be because in the early days when i

658
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,120
started this process

659
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,400
i built

660
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,720
as you would guess another framework

661
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,240
i just wanted to make sure that people

662
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,320
were working more effectively

663
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,080
so if i'm in a

664
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,039
let's say tennessee valley authority

665
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,000
tba is both a power generation

666
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,960
organization and a government agency

667
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,600
right they have to meet nist they have

668
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,200
regulatory requirements they have to

669
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,440
meet they're all over the place there's

670
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,600
a team that sits in building this that

671
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,760
focuses on the regulatory side there's a

672
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,600
team over here in this other building

673
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,400
that focuses on the business side

674
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,080
there's a team over there that focuses

675
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,840
on the federal side

676
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,480
and we said look first step is let's

677
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,400
take all of these requirements because

678
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,200
they are basically all the same

679
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,320
they're applied to different

680
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,440
environments

681
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,360
they're worded a little differently but

682
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,000
let's consolidate them down so if i

683
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,840
implement this requirement from this

684
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,000
standard i should get credit

685
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,919
for anywhere else that same requirement

686
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,520
is reflected

687
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,960
one team one focus let's just basically

688
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,720
pull together these these metrics in

689
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,919
ways that are

690
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,320
that makes sense and let's build kpis

691
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,720
around it

692
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,320
flat logic

693
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,919
because i want to build a performance

694
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,039
indicator

695
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,039
around a requirement to know if the

696
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,120
requirement is adequately

697
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,679
is adequately implemented

698
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,919
but where i broke or when i messed that

699
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,120
up as i forgot about that root cause

700
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,880
it wasn't about whether the requirement

701
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,400
is doing the right thing

702
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,080
it's whether the requirement is

703
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,400
addressing the root cause

704
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,360
how is it defeating the pathway or the

705
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,440
vector that an adversary would take in

706
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,559
order to compromise or otherwise

707
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,360
wreak havoc on my systems through this

708
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,600
thing

709
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,880
where is the threat in my analysis

710
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,679
the real threat

711
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,600
where do you get that

712
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,120
who do you hire

713
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,279
what tools do you implement

714
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,159
where are those things

715
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,080
because when i was working you know

716
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,840
overseas and what have you

717
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,120
i was like man we're going to come in

718
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,559
we're gonna tell these folks they got

719
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,480
involved man they got their policies in

720
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,159
place they're all there between law

721
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,600
enforcement and critical understanding

722
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,559
they got

723
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,240
this massive framework that they've

724
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,840
implemented

725
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,440
and what i found was this just like

726
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,840
everyone else if you're building a house

727
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,080
if you're building a house do you build

728
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,679
the roof first

729
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,360
or the founder you did the foundation

730
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,000
ready first

731
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,840
right

732
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,559
foundation and then you build a

733
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,200
substructure

734
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,679
i can't i kid you not

735
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,919
give me anything any place in the world

736
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,320
any commercial facility government

737
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,360
agency

738
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,520
and within about a month i can build

739
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,360
their roof

740
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,279
it's been built so many times like you

741
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,000
know

742
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,240
i sleep in that stuff i dream in that

743
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,360
stuff

744
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,120
i've been exposed to it from the very

745
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,240
beginning days of my career

746
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,960
but what's the foundation this is why

747
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,799
there's so much red up on the screen

748
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,720
when we talk about the performance of

749
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,320
cyber across

750
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,880
critical infrastructure in government

751
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,559
it's because the foundation is all

752
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,840
broken but what is the

753
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,679
foundation it's very simple

754
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,840
it's all about how well we know the

755
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,679
threat

756
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,240
but how do you build that

757
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,559
what we're going to find is that in

758
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,799
most of

759
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,279
government and just how we're organized

760
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,320
some key pieces of this are there

761
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,799
and some key pieces are missing

762
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,640
and the ones that are there probably

763
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,120
aren't doing things the way they should

764
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,320
be doing

765
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,440
i'm not going to read them off to you

766
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,760
but here are the five questions there's

767
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,159
five questions we came up with that said

768
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,480
if you can't answer these intelligently

769
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,880
or say yes to any of these

770
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,039
you probably have a roof

771
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,520
without a foundation

772
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,960
my buddy's really happy that i put the

773
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,840
word fundamental

774
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,679
so performance-based cyber is this

775
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,279
number one

776
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,279
you have to be working off of a cyber

777
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,279
threat index

778
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,880
if you are working for those who aren't

779
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,120
familiar with the threat index this is

780
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,880
essentially a breakdown of known threats

781
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,240
compromises attributes and

782
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,399
characteristics of known threats

783
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,159
that are published today there's tools

784
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,000
for this in fact there's a free one you

785
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,600
can use

786
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,679
most of your big names in cyber either

787
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,159
take from that source and put some sort

788
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,480
of white label on it or what have you

789
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,919
it's all public to me

790
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:48,960
it's

791
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,039
60 fathoms deeper than what you're going

792
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,320
to get if you're reading out of a

793
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,840
standard

794
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,919
but we start with a threat index in

795
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,880
other words are we even looking at the

796
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,120
root cause

797
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,399
the second thing is you have to emulate

798
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,039
that threat

799
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,240
in

800
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,520
nuclear they have this thing called

801
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,960
force on force

802
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,480
anyone familiar with that or hear that

803
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,919
before

804
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,279
them either

805
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,039
so what force on force was is they'll

806
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,799
get these special ops guys out of the

807
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,799
army to come in

808
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,320
and they will basically attack the plan

809
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,080
and that's how they test the physical

810
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,240
security of the plant the nuclear power

811
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,080
plant is one of the is probably more

812
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,320
protected than just about any dod

813
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,200
facility out there aside from mexico it

814
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,799
is tight

815
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,960
and that's how they got there

816
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,799
not because they were analyzing the

817
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:41,679
threat

818
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,440
but because they were attacked by the

819
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,120
threat

820
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,880
give an example

821
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,200
uh post 911

822
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,080
you know

823
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,080
look at where we are today

824
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,679
today is 9 11 right post 9 11 you have

825
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,840
to protect these plants from a physical

826
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,200
threat

827
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,960
you should probably put a fence up

828
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,919
all right the requirement is i got to

829
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,159
put the fence up

830
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:08,880
so

831
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,440
i'm gonna put a fence chain link all the

832
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,919
way around the property that's about six

833
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,039
foot high

834
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,080
requirement is met

835
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,080
100 satisfied

836
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,600
goes up the chain all the way up to the

837
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,679
plant manager plant manager is like

838
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,679
awesome job guys it cost us 250 000 to

839
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,000
put a basic fence up around this place

840
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,880
but

841
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,320
requirement met we're good to go

842
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,840
and then these

843
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,520
leathernecks come in with their you know

844
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,600
special forces highly trained folks come

845
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,919
in and their job is to test

846
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,440
whether or not these

847
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,960
fence is going to work

848
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,799
so what they do

849
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,440
they just snip it up and walk through

850
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,679
throw their gear over climb over

851
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,240
and they fail i mean the plant fails

852
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,000
miserably

853
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,880
oh

854
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,559
i guess we gotta fix them we should make

855
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,679
these fences eight feet

856
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,080
next force on force they bring ladders

857
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,880
so today where

858
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,919
i won't go into how these plants are

859
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,760
the security around the plant is

860
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,200
organized

861
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,600
but it is not the six foot beds

862
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,919
and you will get shot

863
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:24,960
so

864
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,919
the requirement being the focus led to

865
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,519
iterative they call it a regulatory

866
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,600
ratchet meaning every year was tight

867
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,960
just a little bit more that was because

868
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,039
they kept focusing on the requirement

869
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,200
and not on the performance

870
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,320
and it wasn't until those guys came in

871
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,240
and actively attacked the plant that

872
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,840
they understood what performance needed

873
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,120
to be

874
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,679
that's what offensive cyber is that's

875
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,159
your force on force

876
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,000
that is not someone coming in with a

877
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,519
laptop

878
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,919
running a scan against your network and

879
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,600
trying to find where the vulnerabilities

880
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,799
are

881
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,120
maybe a pivot here or two

882
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,960
and then giving you the results it is

883
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,480
not a 75 page rules of engagement

884
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,320
that stops them from looking at anything

885
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,440
that

886
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,039
let's be honest it's probably the most

887
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,679
important thing to get

888
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,960
then we have cyber hunting and incident

889
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,440
response

890
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,799
you have to have someone actively

891
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,799
looking for that threat

892
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,519
but we got to get things back to normal

893
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,720
and then we have the folks that are

894
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,559
monitoring it can they detect it

895
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,080
and then lastly how do we all work

896
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,240
together to make it all come together

897
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,960
so what is the performance model if i'm

898
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,480
an offensive guy

899
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,080
how long can i be in that environment

900
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,679
before you find me

901
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:44,880
the longer

902
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,679
the better i've done my job

903
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,240
in other words pardon my french

904
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,200
how sneaky of a bastard can i be

905
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,320
until you can identify me

906
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,960
and then if you're a threat hunter it's

907
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,200
can i find it

908
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,000
if i got beacons coming in constantly

909
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,399
i'm throwing those out to a cyber index

910
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,159
a threat index rather

911
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,440
and i and i identify all those threats

912
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,679
then i would essentially identify every

913
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,519
instance where the the emulated

914
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,039
adversary has

915
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,440
attacked my environment

916
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,679
incident response same thing

917
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,760
have they fully gone in and eradicated

918
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,200
that and brought us back to normal

919
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,320
conditions

920
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,039
and then lastly

921
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,559
can operations even see it

922
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,799
what do they need to do to really tune

923
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,320
it

924
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,399
not to take the noise out

925
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,799
which is what most tuning is

926
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,320
because i'm a human and i can only

927
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,519
process so much data at a given time

928
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,760
but how do i tune it so that it's

929
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,600
touching on the things that i know have

930
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,399
compromised my environment

931
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,440
so if you're offensive you're only

932
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,600
successful if the beacons keep beating

933
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,360
and keep sending data

934
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,080
i keep getting alerts i'm still alive

935
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,399
still alive still alive

936
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:07,600
so i

937
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,760
if i'm a threat hunter i only get credit

938
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,918
when those beacons die

939
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,839
or i found the location for where those

940
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,239
beacons are instant response i only get

941
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,239
credit when those beacons are eradicated

942
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,399
and done

943
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,960
not worried about the requirements the

944
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,239
requirements the frameworks the nist all

945
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,440
of that is

946
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,879
intertwined in this in the

947
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,879
superstructure

948
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,879
but foundationally that's how i know

949
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,399
is the threat in there

950
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,320
has it been identified and hasn't been

951
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,280
removed if not

952
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,719
then everything we're doing is a waste

953
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,879
of time

954
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,320
that's what the model looks like it's

955
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,960
very simple

956
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,440
thread index is updated

957
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,119
keep in mind

958
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,119
this is not a friendly

959
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,599
this is not a friendly thing

960
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,920
it requires that what we call a high

961
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,960
state of agitation

962
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,240
meaning

963
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,240
we don't work together necessarily as a

964
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,599
team

965
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,440
the only time we come together as a team

966
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,119
to learn from one another

967
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,640
is in the training aspect

968
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,640
i mean everyone can we can be enemies

969
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,760
during the day but we're all going to be

970
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,839
drinking beers at night talking about

971
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,279
how much fun we had that day

972
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,200
so when it goes when then when an

973
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,560
adversary

974
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,800
an emulated adversary successfully

975
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,480
attacks the environment

976
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,839
they're not going to tell you what they

977
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,200
attacked they're not going to tell you

978
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,320
where it is and they're going to tell

979
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,160
you anything about it they're just going

980
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,400
to tell you that you have been

981
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,680
attacked

982
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,720
it's called persistent operations

983
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,440
they are actually emulating the real

984
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,720
threat

985
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,920
it's not going to call you on the phone

986
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,480
and say well it's ransomware then they

987
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,640
really want to get your attention

988
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,240
but the threat is not going to actively

989
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,920
give you a ring and say hey i'm in your

990
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,359
environment here's where i am this is

991
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,480
what you got to do to fix it

992
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,520
so it's a high standard of agitation

993
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,320
cti gets updated

994
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,480
everyone there said hey

995
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,200
looks like we got an active compromise

996
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,359
now what the hell do you do

997
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,240
well

998
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,640
let's kick out those thread hunters

999
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,920
that's right hunters go out there and

1000
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,720
the threat hunters are late

1001
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,599
right and then

1002
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,520
instant response is like well i can't do

1003
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,040
anything until you go out and actually

1004
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,560
figure out where these compromises are

1005
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,560
located i need to know what systems i

1006
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,000
need to know what the pathway was i need

1007
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,320
to know what's going on

1008
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,839
and until that happens i can't do my job

1009
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:45,200
operations is going i didn't see nothing

1010
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,079
i have no idea what we're talking about

1011
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,920
they're scouring through logs they're

1012
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,280
looking for alerts that they've been

1013
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,760
ignoring forever because somehow water

1014
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,680
takes the pack of least resistance and

1015
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,520
they had tuned out the thing that was

1016
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,560
the least resistance

1017
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,720
high state of agitation it's a beautiful

1018
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,959
thing

1019
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,680
now we got to fix it though so how do we

1020
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,440
fix things in cyber

1021
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,160
we

1022
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,320
build a framework

1023
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,720
once again here we go we're down that

1024
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,320
framework path

1025
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,040
this is a little different

1026
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,839
we call it threat and then

1027
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,079
this is a really busy slide

1028
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,839
but this is the case study that is he

1029
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,599
was doing to say hey how do i change

1030
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:30,640
this thing

1031
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,760
because if i'm going to be in this

1032
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,440
career for maybe 10 more years i want to

1033
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,119
leave a little better than my first

1034
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,680
pound how to get the red off this slide

1035
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,359
how do i get those

1036
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:43,280
gaa reports to say something really good

1037
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,440
here's the foundation

1038
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,680
this is the substructure

1039
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,119
this is where you start and it has to

1040
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,359
inform whatever the superstructure is

1041
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,280
if the superstructure is built in the

1042
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,800
silo

1043
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,240
it's a waste of time

1044
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,439
and waste a month yes

1045
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,280
eye it's a little bit of the root cause

1046
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,200
of why we are where we are in cyber

1047
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,200
security do you expect that they're

1048
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,599
going to do anything or do you expect

1049
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,359
that they're not built from a point

1050
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,040
where they're not going to do anything

1051
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,800
and you've got to protect at all well

1052
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,480
you seem like someone that would be

1053
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,320
around the fire with us drinking a beer

1054
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,320
and smoking cigars

1055
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,480
how would you answer that question i

1056
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,760
would probably imagine you're not going

1057
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,520
to get the economics of them to do

1058
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,079
anything right but i feel like that's

1059
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,079
part of the problem today is they need

1060
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,200
to be held a little bit more responsible

1061
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,040
through some needs right it's got to be

1062
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,720
a little bit of give and pay and i feel

1063
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,960
like industry is

1064
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,960
very much about getting pushed out

1065
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,560
right

1066
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,640
well the problem is until we have enough

1067
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,640
data and to put pressure

1068
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,880
you know to shine the light in that room

1069
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,280
it's hard to push change into something

1070
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,880
as big as like the defense industrial

1071
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,760
place

1072
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,040
right

1073
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,640
so going back to this concept of the boy

1074
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,720
acquisition vendor community defense

1075
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,480
industrial base everything outside of

1076
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,040
this one thing that i really care about

1077
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,040
i'm thirsty i want to drink this water i

1078
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,119
care about this water

1079
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,280
everything outside of that is the void

1080
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,119
that is that dark energy that's moving

1081
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,240
stuff around that understanding

1082
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,359
but i'm not going to be able to

1083
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:46,320
understand it until i emulate them so

1084
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,720
in that example we treat everything

1085
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,000
outside

1086
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,920
of the organization or these protected

1087
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,240
systems weapon systems

1088
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,119
you know

1089
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,480
reactors

1090
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,240
steam generators

1091
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,079
transmission lines whatever they might

1092
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,240
be

1093
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,119
well

1094
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,119
gotta start with us i have offensive

1095
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,000
side

1096
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,319
this is an inverted model

1097
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,319
if you open up a business tomorrow

1098
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,880
someone handed you bezos hands you two

1099
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,560
billion dollars and says i want you to

1100
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,640
build this organization

1101
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,240
first thing you're going to do

1102
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,440
is build a cyber monitoring

1103
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,280
infrastructure

1104
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,280
you're going to lay out your operation

1105
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,720
center you're going to be having you're

1106
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,599
figuring out where you're going to put

1107
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,200
your sensors you're going to have all

1108
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,200
this massive infrastructure you're going

1109
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,640
to be rolling out

1110
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,760
you're going to be bringing in

1111
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,440
truckloads of procedures that you're

1112
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,000
borrowing from somewhere else

1113
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,680
and we're saying

1114
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,359
no

1115
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,839
not yet

1116
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,720
before you start that the first step you

1117
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,280
should take is offensive cyber

1118
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,040
we partner with

1119
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,560
our member organization um

1120
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,119
kryptos

1121
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,040
this is what cryptoces do every day

1122
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,880
sometimes for

1123
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,520
23 hours a day and an insane amount of

1124
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,599
red bull

1125
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,599
but we said look we need a way in order

1126
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,400
to conduct offensive operations under

1127
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,480
all these different scenarios

1128
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,400
i need to be able to do it out in the

1129
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,079
digital ocean i need to be doing it over

1130
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,520
the internet i need to be able to stop

1131
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,280
coming in from the outside

1132
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,400
i need to be able to basically jump on a

1133
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,960
helicopter be flown out to a carrier and

1134
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,280
go down into the bowels of a ship and

1135
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,000
fight the chinese on the line i'm wired

1136
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,760
i need to be able to go out in the field

1137
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,839
in a highly contested area that might be

1138
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,400
on a you know a

1139
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,760
contested border with another nation

1140
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,359
dig around in tunnels where they've got

1141
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,359
a bunch of equipment hanging around i

1142
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:52,960
mean i don't it's going to be all over

1143
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,880
the place i need to be able to look at

1144
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,520
everything from kismet drones to

1145
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,000
you know regular networking stuff i need

1146
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,560
to be able to basically dive into any

1147
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,920
environment and be ready to go

1148
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,520
and that's what the cryptos offensive

1149
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,119
branch did

1150
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,640
so we said okay

1151
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,560
what this thing can do

1152
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,440
is what everything should be doing

1153
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,880
they should have the infrastructure to

1154
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,200
do remote operations and it should have

1155
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,920
the ability to do

1156
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,680
on the ground field operations

1157
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,839
and this is what they use

1158
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,440
they have an offensive range which is a

1159
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,280
tactical range that can basically be

1160
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,000
permanently installed inside of

1161
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,400
a specialized

1162
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,520
area of the organization 100 dedicated

1163
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,280
to offensive work

1164
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,200
but they also have field kits

1165
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,280
still kids are

1166
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,359
a little bit ridiculous i don't know how

1167
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,119
they get so much equipment into one

1168
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:51,280
backpack

1169
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,960
but the core

1170
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,800
can be moved anywhere tactically if

1171
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,640
needed or stationary

1172
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,319
and it has all the components all the

1173
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,079
enclaves all the tools it has the

1174
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,000
ability to

1175
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,599
capture information but do it in a

1176
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,839
secure way it has all of the

1177
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:07,760
infrastructure necessary to conduct

1178
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,920
operations basically over the wire and

1179
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,760
out of the digital ocean

1180
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,200
the field kit is something that

1181
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,520
basically has everything inside the

1182
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,079
offensive range but it's in a backpack

1183
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:19,680
so you got a tactical laptop you got

1184
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,440
your nooks you've got your

1185
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,880
your firewalls you've got all the stuff

1186
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,000
that's in there

1187
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,839
you got everything from uh

1188
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,359
from hardware hacking kits and

1189
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:30,960
everything else in there no matter what

1190
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,960
you this thing has been built off of

1191
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,119
years and years and years of fill-up

1192
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,200
functions

1193
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,319
so we're saying this is where you start

1194
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,640
as you're building your bomb

1195
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,079
whether you do it through kryptos or

1196
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,040
whatever

1197
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,359
you're building your bomb to go out and

1198
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:50,079
pull in your security operations center

1199
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,400
this should be in there

1200
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,599
this should be the first thing you're

1201
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,839
getting

1202
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,960
and then you can build your operations

1203
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,400
but if you're going to do operations you

1204
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,520
better make sure it integrates

1205
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,720
everything

1206
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,119
in the nuclear world or

1207
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:06,960
even in the dod space that has to take

1208
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,599
in to consider physical security

1209
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,200
cyber security

1210
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,040
business security

1211
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,800
class safety cyber streaming plan

1212
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,920
security

1213
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,079
has to be an integrated model

1214
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:19,440
the problem is that we don't get enough

1215
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,119
situational awareness deep into these

1216
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,960
environments

1217
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,119
so you need to adopt systems that can

1218
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,280
get you as close to zero trust as

1219
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,119
possible

1220
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:30,480
which means now we gotta take that

1221
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,400
original framework which was saying hey

1222
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,920
you gotta think about

1223
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,920
industrial automation you got to think

1224
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,640
about industrial control ics scada you

1225
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,200
got i think have

1226
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,920
ot aware components and all this sort of

1227
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,359
stuff integrated into one

1228
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,599
one from one system is it fully zero

1229
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:54,079
trust hell no it's impossible

1230
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,800
but it's as close as you're gonna get it

1231
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,480
so you take technologies and things that

1232
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,720
were developed out of the dod you

1233
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,319
integrate those in with things that are

1234
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:03,839
happening in the plant for physical

1235
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:05,760
security which are also

1236
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,599
key components

1237
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,440
and then you integrate them in you pull

1238
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,280
in partners like siemens because you

1239
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,400
need that ability to

1240
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,480
you need that ability to i understand

1241
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,200
the ot infrastructure

1242
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,960
but you also have to pull in companies

1243
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,079
like zul

1244
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,079
because we're working with 5g and

1245
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:26,720
whatever else we're on the rf

1246
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,119
range at that point

1247
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:30,400
tenable

1248
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,800
and so on and so forth so that's where

1249
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,440
we work with raytheon

1250
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,480
this is big this is huge

1251
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,920
this

1252
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:40,880
this is

1253
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,119
a massive undertaking

1254
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,280
the offensive infrastructure is tactical

1255
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,440
it's small i should be able to throw it

1256
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,440
on the back of a c-130 get it where i

1257
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,280
needed to go and i needed to actually be

1258
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,200
able to grab my backpack my field kit

1259
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,160
and hit the hit the ground runner

1260
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,240
this is a lot of infrastructure

1261
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,640
and raytheon has worked to pull together

1262
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,640
this model

1263
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,680
so those two things working in tandem

1264
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,040
but keep in mind like we said it's a

1265
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,599
high state of agitation operations is

1266
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:11,359
going to basically get inundated with

1267
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:12,160
these

1268
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,240
notifications from the cti saying hey

1269
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,520
i've been hacked

1270
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,359
so it doesn't matter what technology i

1271
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:20,640
buy is it actually doing its job

1272
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,480
and so at some point we have to all come

1273
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,920
together

1274
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,400
and talk about what's really

1275
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,560
working that's where the testing and the

1276
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,640
training comes into play

1277
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,920
going back to your point about the

1278
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,359
supply chain

1279
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,119
right the acquisition life cycle the

1280
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,760
procurement life cycle

1281
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,839
if you got something coming in from the

1282
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:40,720
void

1283
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,280
and you don't know anything about it in

1284
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,680
most cases

1285
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,680
in most cases from what i say you run

1286
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,920
you do some rudimentary testing on

1287
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,000
in other cases you might build a full

1288
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,440
full-blown test plan where you're

1289
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,720
actually got

1290
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,119
basically a test case for every single

1291
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:58,640
security requirement that you would

1292
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,200
think you were handed

1293
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,599
what we said is no you need what we call

1294
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,359
abt

1295
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:08,880
and what that is that's aggression based

1296
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,960
resilience trust

1297
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,640
you need to throw a red teamer at this

1298
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,079
thing

1299
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:15,520
you need someone who is basically

1300
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,119
responsible to determine whether a

1301
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,400
cross-domain solution that you use in

1302
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,359
classified environments at the nsa

1303
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:24,960
is going to like that this computer is

1304
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,280
going into your power plant

1305
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,240
you need a red team review an aggressive

1306
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,880
threat based evaluation a real threat

1307
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,000
based evaluation of that problem

1308
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,040
and then they all have to come together

1309
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,559
and start talking about what they know

1310
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:43,680
they learn

1311
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,280
again we can

1312
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,359
pee in each other's chairs all cheerios

1313
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:48,800
all day long

1314
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,800
but whenever it's time to do the day's

1315
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:51,760
over

1316
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,440
we're going to grab a

1317
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,040
oh i'm older now so pick a low voltage

1318
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,960
and we're going to talk about

1319
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,480
what's what's working and what's not

1320
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,480
working

1321
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,800
so for example if you're using a filp

1322
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,040
kit for advanced uh

1323
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,559
offensive operations and thread

1324
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,200
emulation that's the same field kit that

1325
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,640
incident response and threat hunting

1326
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,640
should be using same tools same

1327
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,240
techniques

1328
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,839
right and you cross train on that so you

1329
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,079
all know them really well

1330
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:21,920
offensive cyber has the secret of where

1331
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,240
this problem is but everyone has the

1332
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,559
same tools to go fix it and how well

1333
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,319
they use those tools and how effective

1334
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,400
they are using those tools that's where

1335
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,079
training comes in

1336
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:34,480
operations is in there where do you

1337
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,760
think

1338
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,920
the leadership the technical leadership

1339
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,200
the engineering leadership and

1340
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:42,640
operations should come from

1341
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,000
it should come from offensive cyber

1342
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,480
so when we say look if the top one

1343
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,400
percent of our field is trained in these

1344
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,000
advanced tactics

1345
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,839
and everything else is you're somewhere

1346
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:55,680
in this pyramid i'm like down to the

1347
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,520
bottom right corner they're like

1348
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,240
somewhere in this pyramid

1349
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,880
they should be training and pushing down

1350
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,280
the moment they're trained

1351
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,839
as an offensive operator

1352
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,760
that's the person i'm moving over to

1353
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,480
threat hunting

1354
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,880
once they're in threat hunting i move

1355
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,359
them into incident response

1356
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:21,200
i can train in an offensive operator

1357
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,079
in incident response processes but i

1358
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:25,599
can't

1359
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:28,400
expect that an incident response

1360
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,400
expert is going to know all the tactics

1361
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,599
that offensive cyber is using

1362
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,160
for the thrillers

1363
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,400
so now we got this matrix team we're

1364
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,160
moving them across

1365
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,040
still

1366
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,880
high-end agitation because the end of

1367
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,640
the day they got to do their jobs

1368
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,160
because how well they do their jobs is

1369
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,880
how well we measure their performance

1370
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,319
but they all come from the same place

1371
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:53,920
and then ultimately

1372
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,680
they work together towards a common

1373
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,440
curriculum

1374
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,079
i have pictures up here of uh

1375
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:02,079
and why we have immersion training so we

1376
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:04,720
would send people into a plant to train

1377
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,440
outsiders who are connected to

1378
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,880
an emulated environment this is a

1379
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,599
pressurized water reactor small small

1380
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:15,200
modular reactor but you're basically

1381
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,880
walking into a plant

1382
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,319
it's the same thing on the offensive

1383
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:19,520
side

1384
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,480
that offensive range and the field kits

1385
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,839
everyone's sitting around a table

1386
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:24,880
learning

1387
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,480
and

1388
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,480
aggregating that that basic knowledge

1389
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,800
one of the other

1390
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,240
and then we're working with raytheon as

1391
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:34,640
well on virtual training

1392
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,559
keep in mind

1393
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:38,480
virtual training

1394
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,119
products like cyber bit

1395
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:43,280
circadians and others

1396
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,359
they're coming a long way

1397
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,040
our biggest thing is is look if you're

1398
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,319
starting out in the field and you're

1399
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:50,400
kind of at that moderate level you need

1400
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,720
a gamified immersive environment so if

1401
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,720
you don't have a scenario based if you

1402
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,880
don't have it truly gamified you're

1403
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,559
wasting your time

1404
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,240
and so we partnered with raytheon they

1405
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,920
have a massive cyber academy in those

1406
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,000
partnerships to do that

1407
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:04,800
but

1408
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,960
when we get to that superstructure up at

1409
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,839
the top you've got to roll out this

1410
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:11,760
understanding to the rest of the cyber

1411
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,599
workforce

1412
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:15,280
not everyone can be the offensive

1413
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,920
operator not everyone's going to be in

1414
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,720
this

1415
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,079
substructure

1416
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:22,559
they're users they are administrators

1417
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:23,599
they are

1418
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:25,599
cyber analysts they're

1419
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:28,800
executives and whatever the case may be

1420
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,079
these are the kind of tools that we

1421
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,160
advocate to say this is how you train

1422
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,000
them

1423
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,680
what's happening

1424
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,760
underneath all of this is how the

1425
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,720
sausage is made it's not important

1426
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,079
in terms of

1427
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,480
what an analyst shows up to do every day

1428
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,079
but it is important

1429
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:48,160
for ensuring that the decisions that are

1430
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,880
being made in the top down are solid

1431
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,200
virtual is the way to go

1432
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,920
is it was primarily an instructor-led

1433
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,359
training because we thought that's the

1434
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:59,040
only way to get immersive

1435
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,640
what we're finding is that a virtual is

1436
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,599
actually

1437
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:03,440
just

1438
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:03,839
so as

1439
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:05,440
contacts out there

1440
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,200
you can talk with chris chenoweth he is

1441
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,640
the

1442
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,760
president and ceo and cto of uh kryptos

1443
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,200
you can talk with me about brinkman

1444
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,880
she's with raytheon

1445
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,559
those are the solutions side of where

1446
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:18,480
we're going but ultimately as an

1447
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,800
organization

1448
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,760
philosophically

1449
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:24,480
that's where our head is right now

1450
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,760
root cause

1451
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,079
100 percent focus on the threat

1452
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:30,160
intelligence needed to make our programs

1453
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,960
better so they can

1454
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:37,630
[Music]

1455
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:44,559
so with that i'll open up the questions

1456
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:48,559
if there are already if not take a break

1457
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:50,559
are there any questions

1458
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,630
yes

1459
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:56,050
[Music]

1460
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,319
you know going back to the vendor

1461
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:11,599
community there's

1462
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:13,040
well i do think there's there's more

1463
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,480
pressure on the vendor community to

1464
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,640
natively protect their systems or have

1465
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,400
the ability to be able to protect them

1466
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,200
with more capability if you will

1467
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,000
it is an unfair expectation

1468
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,760
that a product that is built for

1469
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,599
integration to any environment on the

1470
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:31,440
planet is going to work well in this

1471
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,720
organization

1472
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,480
and the dod and the federal government

1473
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,359
have such a broad operation space

1474
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:38,160
that

1475
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,760
you know it just it puts a lot of

1476
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,079
pressure off your

1477
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:43,200
so

1478
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,200
i do think the capability models or the

1479
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,480
maturity models that they're trying to

1480
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,400
put in place to be able to say hey this

1481
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,839
thing has come

1482
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:51,200
you know it has

1483
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,680
all the necessary native ability to

1484
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,559
integrate into my security architecture

1485
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:58,960
or to work well with my architecture

1486
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,400
is good

1487
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,720
at the end of the day it's all in my

1488
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,520
opinion still requirements truly

1489
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,800
in other words

1490
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,319
they're not asking the vendor community

1491
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:10,880
to come in and say hey is this thing

1492
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,000
is there a

1493
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,680
true resilience trust with this

1494
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,040
component

1495
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,160
can you guarantee me that this black box

1496
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,559
is basically resilient to attack from an

1497
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:23,119
advanced adversary

1498
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:24,960
and they have no none of them can answer

1499
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,200
that one

1500
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,640
if the government went out to let's say

1501
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,480
the department of agriculture went to

1502
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,839
its vendor community because they have

1503
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:36,559
to do a 3 billion infrastructure upgrade

1504
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:39,760
of its id infrastructure and they picked

1505
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,480
one of the big beltway bandits to do

1506
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,000
what if the department of agriculture

1507
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,440
said something like tell you what

1508
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,240
whatever successful vendor is pulled in

1509
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,559
to do this work is going to be subjected

1510
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:55,119
to our aggression based performance

1511
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:57,440
evaluation team

1512
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,599
and if you fail that you lose the

1513
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:01,680
contract

1514
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,760
in layman's terms

1515
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,440
if you're opening up your doors for me

1516
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,079
to comment and and basically act as the

1517
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:11,599
adversary and hack you or penetrate you

1518
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,680
or compromise you and you're willing to

1519
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,599
undergo that level of scrutiny and

1520
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:17,119
testing

1521
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:19,119
then that's a serious confidence on the

1522
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:20,799
other side

1523
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:22,240
to me that's

1524
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,960
that has a much much higher value not

1525
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,720
i've got a list of requirements i have

1526
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,319
to meet can you make sure that your

1527
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:30,319
technology can meet these requirements

1528
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:32,640
for some sort of capability some new

1529
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,118
software

1530
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:41,520
that is

1531
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,839
that is the product of what the lawyers

1532
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:44,880
say

1533
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,480
has to be done before i can make a

1534
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,280
procurement decision

1535
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,000
and

1536
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,079
that's an evolution

1537
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,520
but i think we're still problem

1538
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,880
[Music]

1539
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,280

1540
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,040

1541
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,720

1544
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,399
say that again one more time

1545
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,799

1546
