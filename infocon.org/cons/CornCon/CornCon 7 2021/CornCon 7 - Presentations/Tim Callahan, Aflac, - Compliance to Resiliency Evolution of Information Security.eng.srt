1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,440
oh i'm tim callahan i certainly

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,000
appreciate the opportunity to present to

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,599
corncon

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,480
i hate that i cannot be there in person

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,400
but with travel restrictions and quite

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,720
frankly some illness i'm not able to

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,720
attend but i hope this will be a

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,279
valuable presentation i'm going to kind

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,840
of talk to you my experience and journey

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,119
from

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,519
basically a compliance

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,800
centric security model to one where

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,879
we've evolved to resiliency

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,239
the information security program i've

15
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,800
been in information security probably a

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,039
little over 20 years now in the civilian

17
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,000
world

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,559
and i've seen it really

19
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,920
more from a very compliance-centric kind

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,480
of program to one that is really

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,079
business enabling

22
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:56,960
and

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,760
you know i think it's one you know we

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,760
will continue to progress

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,879
and and evolve but i think we we're

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,240
really getting to the point where most

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,119
um

28
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,040
senior executives within

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,799
companies especially

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,880
companies that are regulated companies

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,920
that have

32
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,320
a lot of customer information or

33
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,560
critical infrastructure companies

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,360
the

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,200
executives are seeing it as an essential

36
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,799
program to

37
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,280
protect the company and protect uh the

38
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,759
critical assets of the company

39
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,479
compliance and many of you and the

40
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,799
audience may remember these days i

41
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,759
remember when i first worked for a bank

42
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,840
our

43
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,360
program was really centered on

44
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,960
compliance the ffiec the federal

45
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,880
financial examination

46
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,320
and federal financial industry

47
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,119
examination council would

48
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,000
issue

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,280
guidance

50
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,360
and then we would be

51
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,680
examined on our compliance with that

52
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,040
guidance

53
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,119
it's not that we were not concerned

54
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,759
about quote security it's just at that

55
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,239
time there wasn't that big of a threat i

56
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,680
can recall a

57
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,400
bank that recruited me and i went there

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,319
and i asked them what the challenge was

59
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,560
and they said they wanted to become an

60
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,400
acquiring bank they wanted to have a

61
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,760
federal charter they wanted to do

62
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,440
you know to expand greatly their

63
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,599
business but their regulatory

64
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,120
environment

65
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,000
was

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,519
uh hampering that

67
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,280
that uh you know the right their

68
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,760
particular regulator would not

69
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,599
sign off on some of the things they want

70
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,000
to do until they got their technology

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,080
risk and security program uh within

72
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,200
their accepted regulatory standards

73
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,959
and so that was my mission there was

74
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,800
very little talk about the criminal

75
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,000
threat

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,959
actual

77
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,800
fraud those kinds of things it was

78
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,920
really concentrated on

79
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,959
getting us into compliance

80
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,680
and then we discovered

81
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,760
some time

82
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,040
after that

83
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,040
we started to see an increase in the

84
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,920
criminal threat and many of y'all again

85
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,360
know that

86
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,800
the

87
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,800
many companies that were quote in

88
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,280
compliance

89
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,760
were breached anyway so we we knew that

90
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,519
we could not uh rely on just compliance

91
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,000
so you started to see security programs

92
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,120
come about that were multi-faceted

93
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,360
and you know we had to learn we had to

94
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,480
grow

95
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,519
you know

96
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,440
you know on this chart it shows some of

97
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,159
the

98
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,840
essential elements of the security

99
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,920
program this is not all of them

100
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,879
but

101
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,319
very important

102
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,280
to

103
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,640
the program became threat intelligence

104
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,680
and vulnerability management uh a strong

105
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,319
security ops that that had the ability

106
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,360
to monitor the environment and to

107
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,439
be trained on how to respond to

108
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,519
incidents we had to look at it from a

109
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,439
standpoint of holistic standpoint of

110
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,319
information governance

111
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,200
in risk management certainly you know in

112
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,799
in the days of compliance uh vendor

113
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,680
security was important but it became

114
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,680
even more important as part of the the

115
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,040
supply chain

116
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,560
so we saw

117
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,880
this evolving into this acknowledgement

118
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,680
that we had to protect our environments

119
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,840
uh

120
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,080
from threats criminal nation state

121
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,320
whatever

122
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,840
so then how

123
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,520
you know this uh

124
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,840
started to bring on a discipline of of

125
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,160
what really a strong security probe

126
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,880
consisted of and this is a kind of a

127
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,639
high-level brief statement of what the

128
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,800
anatomy of the security program is you

129
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,400
know it's all about understanding your

130
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,759
risk

131
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,720
and then selecting a framework that you

132
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,360
can measure yourself by you can

133
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,280
begin to

134
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,400
understand that based on your particular

135
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
risk profile of your company and the

136
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,199
risk tolerance of your company what

137
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,600
type of framework you need and then what

138
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,120
components of that framework are

139
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,880
important to the company

140
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,400
and then

141
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,800
from that you develop a strategy you

142
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,880
establish a governance program an

143
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,479
oversight

144
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,280
program one of accountability

145
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,800
having

146
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,400
you know understanding who control

147
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,560
owners with various aspects of the

148
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,680
company uh those kinds of things

149
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,639
and then you allocate resources that's

150
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,880
commensurate with your risk with your

151
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,400
risk tolerance and with the strategy

152
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,639
and then you can get into the

153
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,560
you know the basics of the nist

154
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,479
cybersecurity framework in this case

155
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,000
where you identify

156
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,960
protect detect respond and recover but

157
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,360
then you need an insurance assurance

158
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,039
program that kind of brings you back

159
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,000
into that loop so it's always a a

160
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,919
continual improving and understanding

161
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,160
so that takes us kind of back to the

162
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,440
maturity

163
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,280
so you've got compliance you've got

164
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,120
security now how do you measure and

165
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,440
that's through some type of maturity

166
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,120
mechanism

167
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,840
basically you're measuring yourself

168
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,080
against your framework certainly and are

169
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,160
you hitting the the needs of that

170
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,840
framework

171
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,560
are you doing your self-assessments

172
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,319
how do you define your report on key

173
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,800
program measures so that you can

174
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,280
give your governance whether it's board

175
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,400
or executive governance programs some

176
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,919
status on

177
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,280
on maturity

178
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,919
uh it's important having independent

179
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,280
assessments

180
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,479
that will

181
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,680
not only

182
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,520
gauge your maturity

183
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,240
but will also

184
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,880
tell you kind of benchmark you against

185
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,360
the industry and tell you how you're

186
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,759
you're measuring in your industry you

187
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,919
know are you at are you

188
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,400
on par or are you behind or are you

189
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,880
ahead of and certainly the magic in a

190
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,360
security program is always to be at

191
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,880
least as good as your peer group

192
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,039
for

193
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,520
so that you're kind of in that herd

194
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,800
some would say you want to be a little

195
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,039
bit better than your peer group

196
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,080
and

197
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,960
that's uh that can be true i think the

198
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,560
difficulty you get in there is

199
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,759
everybody's trying to be a little bit

200
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,680
better than peer group it almost becomes

201
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,160
an arms race but uh

202
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,720
but at any rate that's one of the

203
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,120
strategies i think it's very important

204
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,639
too that you have some mechanism i use a

205
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,880
a business security scorecard and that's

206
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,360
basically where we've taken those

207
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,560
aspects that the business can control

208
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,039
and the business are relied on

209
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,639
and

210
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,680
uh score them on that things like you

211
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,680
know how many high-risk vendors they

212
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,000
have or high-risk vendors

213
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,520
with exceptions where they're not

214
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,720
meeting the standards how many um

215
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,440
exceptions high-risk exceptions and are

216
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,520
they progressing towards remediation on

217
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,240
those exceptions things like we do

218
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,479
phishing test scores so we'll tell them

219
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,800
how their employees in that department

220
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,560
or in that division are doing on their

221
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,800
fishing scores but it's important that

222
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,120
you let the business know and hold them

223
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,720
accountable for the things they can

224
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,800
control now so much of our security

225
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,879
program they don't have control over i

226
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,960
mean we we have a centralized security

227
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,960
program so we do all the monitoring and

228
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,840
the

229
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,520
incident response and those kinds of

230
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,719
things certainly we don't hold the

231
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,719
business accountable for that but there

232
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,880
are things that they can do and through

233
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,000
that mechanism it continuously brings us

234
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,479
to a higher level of maturity so i think

235
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,000
it's it's very important that we pay

236
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,920
attention to maturity

237
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,959
but then you know there started to be we

238
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,600
started seeing in the industry a whole

239
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,240
lot of

240
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,880
security breaches and out of that came a

241
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,800
whole lot of

242
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,720
litigation

243
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,120
and so i think you know as security

244
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,959
professionals we needed to start taking

245
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,720
that into account

246
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,440
the defensibility of our program

247
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,600
are we defend have we established a

248
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,920
program that if we're deposed or if

249
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,519
there's legal action or if there's

250
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,760
regulatory action

251
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,000
is it defensible have we practiced a

252
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,200
standard of reasonableness i mean you

253
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,320
most uh regulatory regimes most

254
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,680
legal standards are that you have a

255
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,760
program that is reasonable and

256
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,920
commensurate with the size and

257
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,880
complexity the risk of your organization

258
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,720
so that becomes kind of the defensible

259
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,440
standard how do you define that and how

260
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,600
do you defend that

261
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,839
certainly having some type of industry

262
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,560
accepted framework whether it's nist or

263
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,760
or some of the other good ones out there

264
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,480
having a program that maturity program

265
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,360
contributes heavily to this so you can

266
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,200
you can say i've been assessed by

267
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
independent we mark our cell phone

268
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,440
maturity we score ourselves we hold

269
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,920
ourselves accountable across the company

270
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,240
uh and we've implemented this framework

271
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,600
so that becomes part of the

272
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,480
defensibility you know when we when we

273
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,440
see ourselves in some of these risk

274
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,600
decisions are we

275
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,000
looking at it from a standpoint of at

276
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,200
some point i may have to defend this uh

277
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,600
and would this be redeemed reasonable in

278
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
that light and certainly you know some

279
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,839
of those judgments are

280
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,680
you know hard to make

281
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,680
but if you're if you're kind of pointing

282
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,519
in the right direction

283
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,839
consulting with your internal legal team

284
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,720
those kinds of things generally you wind

285
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,440
up

286
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,600
okay

287
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,120
we found out

288
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,519
even with this that we also have

289
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,800
to look at

290
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,320
or start looking in light of resiliency

291
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,959
there's a quote here by richard a clark

292
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,680
that he and his

293
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,839
co-author robert kanaki wrote a book

294
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,600
called the fifth domain

295
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,519
and part of what they did is they they

296
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,839
went and they studied companies

297
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,480
companies that had been breached and

298
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,640
somewhat survived the bridge came out

299
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,040
kind of okay companies that

300
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,200
uh had been breached but didn't do so

301
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,079
well

302
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,079
and then they compared and what they

303
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,040
found

304
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,880
is that the companies that really

305
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,040
concentrated on

306
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,519
resiliency and and you can define

307
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,240
resiliency many ways uh for the sake of

308
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,880
this conversation it's really thinking

309
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,920
through

310
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,800
um

311
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,880
if we have an incident how will we

312
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,440
respond to that what are our controls

313
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,320
how we would detect that

314
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,680
how can we build our systems our network

315
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,640
our

316
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,000
business in a way that can withstand

317
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
some of the impact of a cyber attack so

318
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,079
that we can continue to do business and

319
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,800
continue to serve our customers

320
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,560
all of this forms this kind of

321
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,120
philosophy of resiliency and i think

322
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,800
that's something that

323
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,839
you know the

324
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,839
security professionals are really having

325
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,279
to look at a lot more we we know that no

326
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,639
matter how

327
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,839
good we do

328
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,160
uh we're going to

329
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,560
still be subject to attack or

330
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,839
maybe even a successful attack

331
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,000
so just building that

332
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,560
possibility into your program

333
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,320
is very important

334
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,880
you know i i recall a story of jp morgan

335
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,160
chase way back when when they had a a

336
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,680
breach a few years back i should say

337
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,360
you know they they actually did a pretty

338
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,959
good job

339
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,839
they detected it it was contained

340
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,880
although it was a very aggressive

341
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,360
attack they were able to contain it and

342
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,399
then they came out all right i remember

343
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,720
jamie dimon coming and making a public

344
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,680
uh statement about it saying look we we

345
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,959
take security seriously we're a big bank

346
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,399
we

347
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,120
want to protect our customers we spend

348
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,200
a lot of money on security

349
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,399
uh and

350
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,800
you know those that that response that

351
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,680
jp morgan did to that uh particular

352
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,519
incident i think serve them very well

353
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,120
but those are the kinds of things that

354
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,600
build you toward a more resilient

355
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,079
environment and so what are some keys to

356
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,760
resiliency

357
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,079
well uh

358
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,440
we uh

359
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,279
some years back

360
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,000
in 2017 i believe it was

361
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,760
we decided to adopt an all hazards

362
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,920
approach to our planning tour crisis

363
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,519
management

364
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,800
and

365
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,399
we kind of shifted away from a

366
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:48,639
facility-centric recovery model and you

367
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,959
know again some of you may remember the

368
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,519
days where uh every

369
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,800
business recovery type strategy involved

370
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,160
we're going to bring in trailers and

371
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,560
we'll put people in trailers well we

372
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,639
started calculating one day or i did

373
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,720
started calculating how many trailers i

374
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,560
would need and there was no place to

375
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,560
park all the trailers if if we were

376
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,160
really going to do that

377
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,720
uh and and it presented a lot of other

378
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,519
issues so we adopted uh a work from

379
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,240
anywhere model and and when i say that

380
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,760
it's uh you know we

381
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,480
we put in the security the technology

382
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,199
infrastructure we invested in several

383
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,399
flexible access technologies so that our

384
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,320
people could go anywhere

385
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,160
get into the environment uh and work

386
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,519
you know certainly we had to build in

387
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,199
defenses to make sure that we could do

388
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,040
that and do that safely

389
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,600
so when

390
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,320
and through that we

391
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,000
uh we saw that

392
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,160
uh it would meet so many different

393
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,639
scenarios so if we could work from

394
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,720
anywhere uh it could uh address you know

395
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,440
physical environmental type

396
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,560
uh concerns disasters uh you know ice

397
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,959
storm snow storms the kinds of things

398
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,519
that at least down in georgia tends to

399
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,360
paralyze us

400
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,399
it could address pandemic and and

401
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,000
you know so that became a critical part

402
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,760
of our pandemic plan

403
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,120
when we uh found in

404
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,079
you know 2020 that we would have to go

405
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,839
out

406
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,720
of the workplace because we had adopted

407
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,199
that it really enabled us to do that

408
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,560
fairly

409
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,920
quickly so that's an example where uh

410
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,399
building in that resiliency uh really

411
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,600
has helped us out in several scenarios

412
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,279
we're seeing more

413
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,839
you know movement to the cloud so that

414
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,519
will also help in our resiliency because

415
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,199
the nature of the cloud being able to

416
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,959
spin up spin down

417
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,720
being able to have

418
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,399
different regions

419
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,800
those kinds of things also

420
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,639
contribute to us

421
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,560
i will also add we we started a campaign

422
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,839
of not relying on printed documents and

423
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,320
we did that to help people it wasn't

424
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,560
just oh we don't want to save we don't

425
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,480
want to you know kill trees that's

426
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,320
certainly part of it very important part

427
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,000
of it but it was

428
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,399
we can make you so much more independent

429
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,880
if you build in processes that you can

430
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,480
do digital t

431
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,680
and not be reliant on a piece of paper

432
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,839
and that really helped us tremendously

433
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,240
in the pandemic response

434
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,000
we follow a a you know a

435
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,279
response

436
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,639
program that

437
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,199
you know very quickly

438
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,320
classifies incidents as you know

439
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,360
to the degree of severity uh and they

440
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,040
also that drives kind of a response plan

441
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,839
you know

442
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,480
many in most things happen at a very

443
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,519
local level so we've got local plans in

444
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,920
particular uh cities or regions or

445
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,320
whatever that that we work in that can

446
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,720
be you know contained there

447
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,720
and then we you know we could

448
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,520
we split ourselves into regional

449
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,439
uh crisis plans of of maybe impacting

450
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,160
you know whole countries uh rather than

451
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,280
uh globally and then certainly we have

452
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,679
the global response plan

453
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,119
and we have a well-defined um

454
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,880
criteria for these but also a

455
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,119
well-defined response knowing when to

456
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,440
escalate to that next level and then

457
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,799
what to do

458
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,360
we we practice our global uh crisis

459
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,080
management plan at least annually with

460
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,200
our executives we do it more frequently

461
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,240
with our in our different uh teams our

462
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,320
global crisis teams our technology teams

463
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,120
etc but we at least have a

464
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,840
once a year tabletop exercise so that

465
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,840
everybody knows you know what the plan

466
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,559
is and what to do that helps build our

467
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,000
resiliency

468
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,400
so anyway just some takeaways here

469
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,880
as i kind of

470
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,600
tie the these loose ends up compliance

471
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,360
is table stakes we know that we've got

472
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,200
to do that to stay in business if you're

473
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,520
in a regulated business especially

474
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,120
you just have to do that if you're going

475
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,280
to take customer credit cards you have

476
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,080
to

477
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,640
comply with pci standards

478
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,400
that's just essential but that won't

479
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
protect you you have to really have a

480
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,240
strong security program one that you

481
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,240
understand your risk you've identified

482
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,640
it you've quantified it you've got a

483
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,720
defined risk tolerance that you're

484
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,960
working towards and then measuring it

485
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,039
through a maturity program is very

486
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,039
important otherwise you don't know when

487
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,280
you're getting there uh and

488
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,520
and i'm not saying that you'll ever be

489
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,720
at your

490
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,960
uh particular maturity mark it's it's

491
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,960
kind of a journey you'll get there

492
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,280
you'll you'll nudge up criteria may

493
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,520
change you may have to re but it gives

494
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,679
you something that you can

495
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,600
measure yourself again and then

496
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,000
considering defensibility again how

497
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,799
important that is to understand

498
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,799
you know the standard of reasonableness

499
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,520
and are you meeting it but now driving

500
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,280
towards resiliency

501
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,120
thank you very much i appreciate this

502
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,840
opportunity
