kujawa and this is the state of

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,800
ransomware survival guide to living in a

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,640
ransom world

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,800
as mentioned adam gojawa i've been a

27
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,480
security evangelist from maura bytes for

28
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,400
almost 10 years also worked as their

29
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,640
director of thread intel uh in a lot of

30
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,600
other roles my primary responsibility at

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,880
the company now is to research threats

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,799
share information like in cases like

33
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,119
this and empower our own teams to make

34
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,880
sure that we're you know looking at the

35
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,040
right stuff

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,439
so let's go ahead and jump into it first

37
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,880
we're going to talk about the current

38
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,040
state of ransomware where it's at right

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,200
now and this should all be familiar to

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,720
y'all i hope

41
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,320
um

42
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,680
because it's it's been in the news like

43
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,040
crazy so

44
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,479
first i want to talk about double

45
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,799
extortion

46
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,720
criminals using ransomware over the last

47
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,560
year have actually started stealing data

48
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,920
as well as encrypting it then

49
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,680
threatening to release or sell the data

50
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,560
online if a ransom isn't actually paid

51
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,399
there's no guarantee that stolen data is

52
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,600
deleted and not leaked anyway nor is

53
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,439
there any guarantee that the criminals

54
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,200
won't come back and make sure that the

55
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,119
same they make the same threats again

56
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,119
you know trying to get more money

57
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,960
uh ransomware as a service is a huge

58
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,320
problem it's one of the biggest reasons

59
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,079
that ransomware right now is so bad

60
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,920
today

61
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,399
this refers to a marketplace offering of

62
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,720
custom developed deployed or managed

63
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,959
ransomware families that criminals can

64
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,120
purchase and use in their own attacks

65
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,440
without having needing the know-how of

66
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,840
creating these things uh this increase

67
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,360
in the amount of competition between

68
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,680
ransomware creators led to more

69
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,080
sophisticated dangerous and powerful

70
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,720
malware uh being developed and then sold

71
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,959
on the darknet in addition to ransomware

72
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,120
there are services to create back doors

73
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,040
provide access into an already

74
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,360
compromised network spread threats via

75
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,360
phishing emails or drive by exploits

76
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,760
crypters money launders you name it

77
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,840
and so over the last year we've seen an

78
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,080
alarming increase in the use of hacking

79
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,080
tools created for the purpose of

80
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,319
penetration testing

81
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,840
they're being used to infiltrate and

82
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,159
quickly compromise corporate networks a

83
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,319
big example of this is the platform

84
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,239
cobalt strike which hopefully many of

85
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,000
you are familiar with it was created

86
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,599
originally as a tool to help find

87
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,200
vulnerabilities in a network for

88
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,519
professional penetration testers but

89
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,440
older versions have been seen

90
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,319
being used or modified by criminals and

91
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,400
in deploying real world attacks and

92
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,480
utilizing those same tools that we use

93
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,159
to help protect ourselves against us

94
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,000
not all is bad though law enforcement

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,959
globally has taken very large steps in

96
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,879
bringing down high profile ransomware

97
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,959
groups at least three popular ransomware

98
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,680
families 2021 have vanished because of

99
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,080
law enforcement threat or direct action

100
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,519
such as arrests

101
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,360
however being able to target the entire

102
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,000
ransomware or cyber crime industry is

103
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,080
really a tall order and is unlikely to

104
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,799
happen from a handful of takedowns

105
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,040
and finally multiple hacker forums

106
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,080
online

107
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,720
have adopted a no ransomware market

108
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,040
policy after increasing law enforcement

109
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,959
activity against certain groups

110
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,799
scared them basically this hasn't

111
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,799
stopped actors from selling their wares

112
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,640
on these same forums they are now just

113
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,640
using codespeak to communicate with

114
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,760
their customers

115
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,360
it's worth noting here that ransomware

116
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,760
doesn't make up all the cybercrime there

117
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,280
is you know uh there's a lot of

118
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,040
different types of attacks

119
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,959
from financial ones stealing banking

120
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,560
information stealing passwords and

121
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,560
personal information trying to spread

122
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,320
spam etc etc

123
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,479
um so there's lots of different types of

124
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,440
attacks and lots of different types of

125
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,440
motivations out there and most of them

126
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,120
don't bring the kind of attention that

127
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,520
ransomware brings so because of this

128
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,600
criminals looking to you know continue

129
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,080
their cyber crime activities without

130
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,479
immense heat from law enforcement may

131
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,400
begin to dis distance themselves even

132
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,360
further

133
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,520
from activities of bad guys asking for

134
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,280
things like 35 million dollar ransom

135
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,679
payments

136
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,000
now here's a quick overview of some of

137
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,280
the most popular families currently in

138
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,280
the wild uh there's ryuk which is the

139
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,880
oldest of the families here you might

140
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,880
remember that from uh from them

141
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,520
attacking the la times various hospitals

142
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,759
in the united states uk and germany

143
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,440
dozens of u.s schools in a city in

144
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,639
florida

145
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,320
our evil is one of the most popular and

146
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,000
talked about ransomware families of the

147
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,320
last couple years it also goes by soda

148
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,240
no kibi they were responsible for

149
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,880
stealing nearly a terrified terabyte of

150
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,280
data from law enforcement uh or for a

151
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,120
law firm representing donald trump and

152
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,759
lady gaga and madonna and they tried to

153
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,759
sell it all online however the most

154
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,240
recent big name attack was caused due to

155
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,880
a bug in the cassaya vsa software that

156
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,960
led to the infection of over a thousand

157
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,000
companies

158
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,840
shortly after that attack and after news

159
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,000
about phone calls between the leaders of

160
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,080
the u.s and russia about what to do

161
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,080
concerning this group arya evil's

162
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,680
website went down

163
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,759
and that lasted for a couple months

164
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,520
actually unfortunately it didn't stay

165
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,800
long and they're back with new versions

166
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,960
of the ransomware appearing early in

167
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,199
september so over the last week or two

168
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,280
we've seen them their websites pop back

169
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,440
up and then we've seen new versions of

170
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,600
their malware being distributed so

171
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
re-evil's back

172
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,440
conti ransomware which only showed up in

173
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,680
2020 but in june of 2021 uh the fbi

174
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,360
announced that conti was responsible for

175
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,600
more than 400 cyber attacks against

176
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,680
organizations worldwide it also

177
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,240
specifically targeted at least 16 u.s

178
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,960
first responder and health care networks

179
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,160
this is going to be a trend that we'll

180
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,880
talk about more in a second

181
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,400
so mcgregor which has been around since

182
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,800
september of last year

183
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,919
uh attacked organizations like kmart the

184
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,639
vancouver metro systems barnes noble

185
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,120
ubisoft crytek and demands an average of

186
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,400
about a 390 000

187
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,400
so wasted locker is a new player uh

188
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,080
however it is controlled by the

189
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,240
notorious gang uh hacking group evil

190
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,240
corp who created dangerous banking

191
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,960
malware families like drydex

192
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,120
and finally darkseid made a huge splash

193
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,520
when it figured it was fingered as the

194
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,840
ransomware responsible for the colonial

195
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,720
pipeline breach of may 2021

196
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,199
in july however a new family named black

197
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,639
matter showed up on the scene and

198
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,919
analysts believe that this new

199
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,080
ransomware is just a rebranding of

200
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,240
darkseid likely with the same actors

201
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,240
behind it

202
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,440
so now that we've talked a little bit

203
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,639
about the highlights and we've talked

204
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,800
about the families um how are they doing

205
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,800
this you know what what's what's their

206
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,240
what's the most dangerous stuff for

207
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,919
seeing uh these ransomware groups do

208
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,680
today

209
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,440
so first of all let's talk about rdp

210
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,800
brute force

211
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,759
uh and vulnerabilities attackers have

212
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,520
actually been focused on insecure idp

213
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,440
ports brute forcing them when there

214
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,479
isn't

215
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,560
anything stopping failed login attempts

216
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,639
the number of rdp ports exposed to the

217
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,720
open internet went from 3 to 4.5 million

218
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,680
in january of 2020. in fact in 2020

219
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,240
malwarebytes began detecting our rdp

220
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,319
brute force and failed login attempts

221
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,759
just because of how often we were

222
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,440
observing that attack being used to

223
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,919
breach corporate networks

224
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,240
um cobalt strike which is as i mentioned

225
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,000
a commercial full-featured penetration

226
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,319
testing tool which builds itself as an

227
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,479
adversary simulation software designed

228
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,039
to execute targeted attacks and emulate

229
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,199
the post-exploitation actions of

230
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,360
advanced threat actors

231
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,039
attackers are deploying cobalt strike to

232
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,639
map out vulnerabilities on a network

233
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,400
they have infected allowing for much

234
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,280
faster lateral movement we've seen cases

235
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,919
again and again over the last year of uh

236
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,080
like an rdp compromise or a brute force

237
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,000
or some other you know exploit or

238
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,080
efficient attack that that gives

239
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,039
attackers access at least to the you

240
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,479
know essential servers domain

241
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,000
controllers things like that and that's

242
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,159
why they like to deploy cobalt strike to

243
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,159
help them map out you know the rest of

244
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,000
the network what are what other

245
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,519
vulnerabilities are out there that can

246
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,599
be leveraged you know and and how fast

247
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,958
they can spread so it really really

248
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,839
increases uh their lateral movement

249
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,200
speaking of which i mean if you want to

250
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,920
do

251
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,480
a company-wide attack you need to hop on

252
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,800
every endpoint you can and try to infect

253
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,040
it and once infection of the majority of

254
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,640
endpoints is complete you know

255
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,160
ransomware is launched and hits the

256
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,320
organization all at once versus

257
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,800
infecting systems one at a time

258
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,959
uh and so that's you know that's a scary

259
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,000
problem

260
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,680
um and then finding vulnerabilities you

261
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,279
know huge vulnerabilities like zero

262
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,600
logon or the you know new print

263
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,480
nightmare uh they give attackers domain

264
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,560
administrator access or you know remote

265
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,200
code execution capability and uh are

266
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,360
quickly being added to a lot of criminal

267
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,560
arsenals so the overall concern here is

268
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,720
that ransomware dwell time is going to

269
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,720
shrink as it becomes easier for attacks

270
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,200
to spread

271
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,399
so we're talking about all the attacks

272
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,160
now what are they doing with that data

273
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,800
well double extortion is a huge problem

274
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,120
uh attackers set up auction sites where

275
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,519
nefarious groups can bid on data stolen

276
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,360
from certain ransomware victims

277
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,959
depending on the organization being

278
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,200
attacked this might be no big deal or

279
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,760
this could be a huge disaster

280
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,760
and while many ransomware families have

281
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,360
learned how to target and destroy

282
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,360
software backups it's still one of the

283
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,079
best ways to avoid paying the ransom

284
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,000
by extorting victims through threats to

285
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,800
leak data the victim has fewer options

286
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,399
if any at all so

287
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,880
uh you know you can have backups but if

288
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,640
those backups have sensitive information

289
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,800
and that information was also stolen and

290
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,240
it's not going to be released online i

291
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,399
mean that's that's a whole another issue

292
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,399
you have to deal with and that's a new

293
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,760
you know

294
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,760
that's a new problem

295
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,600
that uh that you have to try to overcome

296
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,560
so the actual process of threatening the

297
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,079
publish data turns out to be more

298
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,000
lucrative in many cases than traditional

299
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,920
ransomware

300
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,160
the creators of our evil mentioned that

301
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,320
this method proved to be so lucrative

302
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,920
that they now make more money from not

303
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,760
publishing stolen data than from

304
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,079
decrypting ransom one in three victims

305
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,440
are currently willing to pay the ransom

306
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,360
to prevent the leaking of company data

307
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,200
it could be the next step in ransomware

308
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,640
business and you know what it probably

309
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,920
will be we'll talk about that a little

310
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,479
bit in a minute

311
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,200
so here's a screenshot of the are evil

312
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,040
auction site where criminals sell off uh

313
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,920
stolen data from their ransom victims

314
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,760
it's just one example of the name and

315
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,680
shame site created by ransomware groups

316
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,600
to threaten the release of private data

317
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
if ransom isn't paid it's really the

318
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,760
second part of double extortion and you

319
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,200
may have seen a lot of different sites

320
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,399
like this out there i mean there are

321
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,000
some of them that say yeah we're gonna

322
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,440
we're gonna auction this off there's

323
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,360
some that say here's just our latest

324
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,959
victim and here's the crap we have on

325
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,279
them um

326
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,320
you know there are all kinds of

327
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,680
different ones but the whole point of it

328
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,880
being at the end of the day a method of

329
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,519
intimidation

330
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,560
so now that we've given over an overview

331
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,000
of the state of ransomware let's answer

332
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,839
the question how bad could it be so

333
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,200
there are potentially two damaging

334
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,680
factors in a ransomware attack the first

335
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,279
is the criminal pushing the ransomware

336
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,440
on the network obviously but the second

337
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,279
is how the organization reacts to the

338
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,800
ransomware attack

339
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,320
the worst case scenario is that a

340
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,800
ransomware attack occurs bypassing your

341
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,120
outward facing security tools and

342
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,600
causing mass panic and configuration or

343
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,000
confusion within an organization which

344
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,760
results in greater damage by the

345
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,079
ransomware and greater disruption to the

346
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,279
organization

347
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,440
and this leads to a much slower and more

348
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,680
expensive recovery operation

349
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,519
so despite this being the worst case

350
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,120
it's also one of the more common ones we

351
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,120
see these days

352
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,800
attacks like this can lead to stories

353
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,360
such as the city of baltimore who ended

354
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,360
up paying over 18 million dollars to

355
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,120
restore their services for a ransomware

356
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,720
attack that demanded less than 80

357
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,040
thousand dollars main reason for that

358
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,720
they were unprepared

359
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,760
they weren't ready for it and they

360
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,320
didn't know how to respond

361
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,079
so let's talk a little bit about the

362
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,680
secret truth francimore what do they

363
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,360
know what do we know what do they know

364
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,839
that we know

365
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,320
first of all the attackers they know

366
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,399
that the cost of recovery against a

367
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,880
ransomware attack can sometimes be

368
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,360
greater than the ransom demand itself

369
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,399
they know that

370
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,839
uh the kind of damage a public

371
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,360
ransomware attack can do to an

372
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,760
organization's reputation and trust for

373
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,160
their customers can be devastating to

374
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,320
the organization itself

375
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,360
and they know that a lot of

376
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,200
organizations put security on a lower

377
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,720
tier of importance which means less

378
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,639
security is a breakthrough for the

379
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,120
attackers now these aren't anything to

380
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,480
say that

381
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,240
you know it's any of our problems that

382
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,160
these things exist it just is the way

383
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,480
you know it is what it is unfortunately

384
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,600
um

385
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,760
a lot of businesses will will

386
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,160
put their their resources and funds into

387
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,040
the development of efficiency of getting

388
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,880
the jobs out of making more money and

389
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,240
security takes a back burner and this

390
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,560
happens all over the world for all

391
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,319
organizations so it seems like you know

392
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,320
it's useful

393
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,560
so what do the criminals uh

394
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,320
not want you to know

395
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,839
well the more prepared you are for an

396
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,040
attack the less

397
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,399
leverage an attacker can have on you

398
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,880
excuse me you know a lot of um

399
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,480
a lot of what makes ransomware so scary

400
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,600
and has over the decade

401
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,560
is that uh is the threat you know the

402
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,120
actual threat of the ransomware itself

403
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,320
there was um a campaign many years ago

404
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,760
and it probably still happens every time

405
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,680
you know every once in a while but uh

406
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,920
you would visit a malicious website and

407
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,519
the only thing it did was just launch a

408
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,720
script and that script would show a

409
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720
little pop-up saying you know you've

410
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,560
been hit with ransomware your your

411
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,800
system's infected your files are being

412
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,639
encrypted pay us money call this number

413
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,000
blah blah blah

414
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,600
and obviously it's bologna because it

415
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,000
was just like a javascript um and it

416
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,120
wasn't encrypting anything he didn't

417
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,680
have the ability to but it was the fear

418
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,000
and the knowledge that people are aware

419
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,519
of ransomware people are afraid of

420
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,839
ransomware that they were hoping to you

421
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,920
know lure in some people so

422
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,959
um

423
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,480
the more you know about this threat and

424
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,920
the more you know about how to defend

425
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,920
against it and recover from it the less

426
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,519
leverage they have

427
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,279
uh there's lots of ways to breach a

428
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,160
network

429
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,399
it also it also often requires greater

430
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,279
trust of users and can network

431
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,959
configuration built for business

432
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,800
efficiency rather than security like i

433
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,040
mentioned to success successfully pull

434
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,920
off a damaging ransomware attack

435
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,920
and this includes network

436
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,880
misconfigurations when user accounts

437
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,040
have too many rights when systems and

438
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,199
services are unpatched or unprotected

439
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,279
and when the security team has only

440
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,720
focused on stopping threats at the

441
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,639
network border

442
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,959
the bad guys like they want you to put

443
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,800
all of your eggs into the prevention

444
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,320
basket because when they find new

445
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,000
methods of attack they're

446
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
less likely to be stopped and i'm pretty

447
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,639
sure everyone here uh hopefully uh and

448
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,079
maybe if you haven't then

449
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,600
congratulations i'm glad you didn't deal

450
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,279
with this but i'm sure a lot of people

451
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,120
have spent a lot a lot of time

452
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,279
developing deploying configuring their

453
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,199
security for a particular avenue of

454
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,920
entry just to be attacked in the back

455
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,600
door or through some other method or

456
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,079
some you know stupid uh lack of

457
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,920
authentication or a user account that

458
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,639
got out of control

459
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,800
so when your entire security focus is on

460
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,639
prevention of an attack you don't

461
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,959
establish internal processes and

462
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,920
controls to protect data uh and you're

463
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,759
playing directly into the hands of cyber

464
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,279
criminals so what we're going to be

465
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,839
talking about in the next section is is

466
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,000
how to fill those gaps you know we

467
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,920
obviously prevention is incredibly

468
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,959
important it's your first line of

469
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,040
defense you need to deploy tools in

470
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,040
order to stop threats that you don't

471
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,320
recognize anything that might get on the

472
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,160
endpoint or on your servers you know

473
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,680
that is a given all right it's like

474
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,959
looking both ways before you cross the

475
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,199
street obviously you're going to do it i

476
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,839
hope you do it

477
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,399
so um

478
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,639
based on the uh observed activity from

479
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,680
the past

480
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,079
uh we can make an educated guess as to

481
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,199
where the criminals are putting their

482
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,440
money today and we've seen this a couple

483
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,920
times you know here and there um

484
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,600
over the last over the last few months

485
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,360
uh the payer get paid don't get paid the

486
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,440
next generation of ransomware is taxed

487
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,839
will be meant to disrupt money making

488
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,480
operations for organizations for example

489
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,079
last year we saw a garment attacked by

490
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,680
ransomware which disabled some of their

491
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,000
services and lost likely lost the

492
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,160
company a lot of money alternatively the

493
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,240
company uh cognizant expects to lose

494
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,240
between 40 and 70 million dollars

495
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,480
because of a ransomware attack so

496
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,520
um

497
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,119
their their goal is going to be less

498
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,000
about

499
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,240
about stealing your money and more about

500
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,959
you know stopping you from making money

501
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,480
so by disrupting operations and

502
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
preventing organizations from from like

503
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,720
i said making money or offering services

504
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,880
the attack is both public and highly

505
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,880
damaging and costly

506
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,119
as opposed to extortion which is

507
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,919
sometimes easy to sweep under the rug or

508
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,840
maybe it's not possible to actually get

509
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,280
any money from an extortion attempt

510
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,600
because uh there was diligent backups

511
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,000
and a prepared victim

512
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,240
uh ransom attacks today aren't what we

513
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,600
dealt with five years ago they're not

514
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,760
what we've dealt with three years ago

515
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,440
um criminals are leading they're

516
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,600
learning what works and what doesn't and

517
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,280
are also not afraid to experiment with

518
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,240
what forms of attack are most effective

519
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,280
seeing criminals heading in the

520
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,720
direction of disruption over extortion

521
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,880
is a representation of that of that

522
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,120
playing around that experimentation and

523
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,720
in some cases it's going to be a serious

524
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,080
payoff

525
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,679
the group behind our evil have even

526
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,840
mused about starting a new uh

527
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,640
distributed denial of service or ddos uh

528
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,880
offering that would flood servers with

529
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,960
traffic and if the attack was successful

530
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,640
enough results in enough uh intimidation

531
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,200
that the the uh the victim is willing to

532
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,360
paid for the attacks to stop now i don't

533
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,559
know if they actually rolled this out or

534
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,840
not i'm not sure uh if it would be that

535
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,039
great of a

536
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,280
of an offering i suppose i mean ddos

537
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,200
attack's been around forever and we have

538
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,000
lots and lots and lots of experience in

539
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,120
our various uh isps and you know service

540
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,960
providers on how to

541
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,720
uh to block and defuse ddos attacks so

542
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,880
yeah it's a cool idea but i think they

543
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,280
need to work on it

544
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,080
so let's talk about the ransomware

545
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,520
survival guide hopefully you guys are

546
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,520
all enjoying your lunch if you're eating

547
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,280
right now uh

548
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,840
i hope it's good

549
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,440
all right so let's delve into some

550
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,039
options that you have

551
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,039
one option is to put time and

552
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,720
consideration into how to properly

553
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,960
secure your internal network as well as

554
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,120
your external network here's the thing

555
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,720
though there isn't an appliance that you

556
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,640
can just install or plug in that

557
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,640
prevents all the kinds of things a

558
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,600
hacker could do to your internal network

559
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,799
imagine that we're trying to protect

560
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,760
volts with all of your company data but

561
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,600
because of how the network is set up

562
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,360
we've only got one vault with both

563
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,520
critical and non-critical data stored in

564
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,600
it and almost everyone in the company

565
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,559
has access to it

566
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,960
instead the goal is to bake security

567
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,720
into the design of the network with

568
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,640
segmentation and proper user account

569
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,679
controls

570
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,320
so imagine that instead of one vault

571
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,280
you're protecting a series of vaults all

572
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,600
hidden baton behind your big vault door

573
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,000
with paths and maze and special access

574
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,640
requirements using this analogy imagine

575
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,880
which fault uh security plan a cyber

576
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,720
criminal would prefer to encounter i

577
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,360
promise you the one with less doors is

578
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,400
the one they would like to go through

579
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,919
because criminals are lazy most of the

580
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,360
time and they'll go after low-hanging

581
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,960
fruit they'll go after whatever they can

582
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,120
grab if we make it easy for them you

583
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,200
know then then that makes their day easy

584
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,600
but if we make it hard for them uh even

585
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,880
harder and more difficult and you have

586
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,400
to spend more time and attention on

587
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,640
going after a particular target you know

588
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,200
you may not be worth it to the attacker

589
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,799
depending on what your organization may

590
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,520
have to steal

591
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,919
so how do you do that first you'll need

592
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,400
to do some network segmentation take

593
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,360
inventory of your data and the most uh

594
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,600
sensitive data such as those that could

595
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,159
cause serious damage to the company uh

596
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,840
if leaked so

597
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,760
these things should be secured with more

598
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,480
controls than other types of data

599
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,240
and this could take the form of rolling

600
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,400
out a new file server or limiting access

601
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,480
to data to only those who absolutely

602
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,039
need it and it will reduce the ease a

603
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,799
criminal will have in gathering critical

604
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,240
data by using hijacked user accounts

605
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,240
um the file server can sit on a

606
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,760
different but connected network that

607
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,520
requires additional credentials to

608
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,000
access or maybe only a few endpoints can

609
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,120
access it

610
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,799
and since the valuable data is harder to

611
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,120
get to it may demotivate the attacker

612
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,720
and like i said leave with whatever

613
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,799
scraps they can get

614
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,120
so this is just across the board you

615
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,240
know um doing this if you don't have

616
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,240
something like this in play already then

617
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,760
i really think you should because it not

618
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,120
only is it going to increase your

619
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,039
security it's also

620
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,480
likely going to increase you know the

621
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,000
organization within uh your network um

622
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,080
and and make it you know a little more

623
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,880
easier to deal with individual groups uh

624
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,919
versus versus trying to give the right

625
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:42,960
you know

626
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,640
permissions to everybody in the company

627
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,760
but in addition to keeping the data in a

628
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,880
more secure uh location being mindful of

629
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,480
who has access is just as important if

630
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,159
everyone has access then the security

631
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,400
doesn't really exist does it so you need

632
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,799
to identify key individuals who need to

633
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,880
access but still make it difficult for

634
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,960
them to access said data without the

635
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,720
proper authentication

636
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,640
now that's always going to be a huge

637
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,480
problem between security and efficiency

638
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,760
you know there's like security

639
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,679
efficiency and and there's like another

640
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:18,640
one but i can't remember what it is

641
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,840
right now um of a triangle where it's

642
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,880
basically in po or privacy security

643
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,760
privacy and efficiency three things that

644
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,640
that

645
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,600
don't always work well together um

646
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,720
unfortunately so uh you know that's

647
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,840
something that we're gonna have to take

648
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,120
into consideration and that's something

649
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,679
that that we have to work into

650
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:40,559
our

651
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,000
operations plans how we're doing

652
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,240
business things like that that's um you

653
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,760
know that's a big difference from just

654
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,240
saying we have our business and we're

655
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,600
thinking about how we do our business

656
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,039
and then we have security which is more

657
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,880
of a bubble around the business and if

658
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,880
something pops that bubble then you're

659
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,120
wide open but what if the business was

660
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,200
the bubble you know what if you had

661
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,000
security built into every process you

662
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,400
could and it may be in an efficient at

663
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,480
first but i think that eventually you

664
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,840
know people would get used to it you

665
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,360
find the right controls you find the

666
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,200
easiest things to use you know don't

667
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,360
give everyone a tiny key fob with the 12

668
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,960
digit number that they have to plug in

669
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,360
that's not going to make anything easier

670
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,799
but having you know one a one-time pad

671
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,640
multi-factor authentication on a phone

672
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,120
or some other you know trusted device

673
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,280
that might be a good idea

674
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,918
so um

675
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,640
you can also like i said use

676
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,919
multi-factor authentication you can

677
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,760
require authorization from additional

678
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,799
parties before access is granted you can

679
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,640
limit what the employee can do with the

680
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,200
data or where they can even take it

681
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,880
i used to work at the nsa for a few

682
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,559
years and so i

683
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,200
this is all coming back to me you know i

684
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,000
think about um all the requirements on

685
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
on accessing certain types of data and

686
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,320
printing things out on leaving the skiff

687
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,720
on you know classifying it correctly all

688
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,559
that kind of stuff that uh you know at

689
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,480
the time when i was like 21 was so

690
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,679
boring but um you know in my 30s now i'm

691
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,039
like wow that was

692
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,120
so important to do i'm glad we did that

693
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,120
it didn't always go correctly sometimes

694
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,039
things got messed up misclassified i

695
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,400
mean you've heard the news

696
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,159
um but nonetheless you know it was it

697
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,240
was a great way to to make sure that

698
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,760
only people who needed to see something

699
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,279
got to see it

700
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,360
you can also assign a custodian for some

701
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,120
uh of you more

702
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,679
with more sensitive stuff um

703
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,559
certain types of files customer

704
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,559
information product information recipes

705
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:35,840
whatever

706
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,520
you can limit access that data to only a

707
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,679
couple of people or even an automated

708
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,400
request system that is secure and can't

709
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,640
be tampered with

710
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,159
who then can pass it on to the people

711
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,360
who need it now that's another thing

712
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,840
that slows things down even more but if

713
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,200
you've got the need for it and you've

714
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,240
got the resources for it why not

715
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,080
um this reduces the amount of user

716
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,919
accounts who have access to

717
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,919
where the data is stored but it doesn't

718
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,840
reduce access to the data by those who

719
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,279
need it other than just making it a

720
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,520
little more difficult for them

721
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,960
now there are tools out there that allow

722
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,600
for remote monitoring of the security of

723
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,480
endpoints and if you identify a possible

724
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,240
infection you can quickly isolate the

725
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,559
suspected system and run a scan

726
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,720
alternatively if you do identify an

727
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,480
infection you can quickly isolate

728
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,799
uninfected systems too

729
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,480
you can also schedule regular scans and

730
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,400
updates to keep endpoints empowered in

731
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,320
protecting their users it's like i said

732
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,320
before you know we i talked about how

733
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,600
putting all your eggs in the basket of

734
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,760
prevention isn't a great idea but you

735
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,960
still need

736
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,039
those eggs in your basket you know you

737
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,600
still need that that prevention

738
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,760
component because that is just the same

739
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,480
as as uh ensuring that you've got the

740
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,120
correct you know data uh segmentation or

741
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,000
that you've got the correct amount of of

742
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,240
uh configured you know services or

743
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,559
multi-factor authentication uh you know

744
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,760
requirements things like that um

745
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,200
those are all fantastic and those are

746
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,799
all going to help a lot especially if

747
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,240
something does get through your defenses

748
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,240
but you still need that outer defense

749
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,919
because it is like i said your first

750
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,440
line of defense your

751
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,679
endpoints your endpoint security

752
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,159
software and your employees see most of

753
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,520
the threats before you ever will

754
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,760
uh so

755
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,720
the

756
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,919
next we're going to talk about a

757
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,640
recovery plan and this is a document

758
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,720
created and frequently updated to ensure

759
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,240
all proper activities are taken in

760
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,120
response to a malware attack i hope that

761
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,880
every organization here already has one

762
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,360
of these or something like it

763
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,360
and you may already you may have a plan

764
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,720
in place for what to do if the

765
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,480
building's on fire you might have a plan

766
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,400
on what to do if you know there's a

767
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,200
flood or there's some other serious

768
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,159
problem

769
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,960
with the organization

770
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,880
so you got to make the same kind of plan

771
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,039
but for cyber attacks and specifically

772
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,240
ransomware

773
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,120
um

774
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,039
you need an initial what to do if i see

775
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,200
malware checklist that all employees

776
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,720
should be aware of

777
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,120
and aware of how to reference and that

778
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,200
ensures protection operations are done

779
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,200
to reduce the damage done by the attack

780
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,440
uh so what i mean by that is that an

781
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,799
attack occurs

782
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,000
and

783
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,640
what do you do first you know if if the

784
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,440
question is an employee sees a ransom

785
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,039
screen on the screen suddenly what are

786
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,320
they going to do are they going to just

787
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,520
sit there are they going to turn it off

788
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,480
are they going to flip out are they

789
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,799
really going to talk to um are they just

790
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:27,919
going to sit there screaming until

791
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,520
somebody shows up who knows whatever

792
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,520
your company plan is that's what you

793
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,120
have to do

794
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,120
and and making sure that people know oh

795
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,880
i see something weird going on here

796
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,279
here's who i call here's who i talk to

797
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,039
here's the first steps i need to make i

798
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,720
need to back away from the system don't

799
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,159
touch it you need to preserve evidence

800
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,640
you know um and you need to contact

801
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,120
someone who can take it from there

802
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,679
so you need a call sheet uh so whoever

803
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,360
identifies the threat can quickly inform

804
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,279
members key members of the company who

805
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,880
can prevent further damage as well not

806
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,279
just it staff but you know the executive

807
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,399
suite uh you know various other teams

808
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,760
or if you need to contact law

809
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,919
enforcement uh or a cyber security or

810
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,480
insurance vendor for next steps those

811
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,399
numbers should also be on there as well

812
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,640
um a lot of organizations you know these

813
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,799
days especially have some kind of

814
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,120
insurance or security you know dedicated

815
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,960
security team or something and you need

816
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,480
to be able to to reach out to those

817
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,919
people quickly say hey this is what

818
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,080
happened what do i do next and they can

819
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,440
help you from there so it's all about

820
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,440
timing you know

821
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,960
these same actions would have happened

822
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,320
inevitably but it could have taken

823
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,159
multiple days instead we're looking at

824
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,760
maybe you know a couple hours hopefully

825
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,440
and you need to have you know policy set

826
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,399
in place before you have to consider

827
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,440
them honestly because they will take

828
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,520
time if you do not have that you don't

829
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,520
have you know to figure them out for

830
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,320
instance do we pay ransom what should uh

831
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,080
what system should have the highest

832
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,240
priority in recovery what are the

833
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,720
operations required to restore backups

834
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,240
you know um

835
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,480
who i mean not just who to call

836
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,120
but you know what to do next and and how

837
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,159
to get things back up and running uh one

838
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,480
story i have about how things can go

839
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,799
really bad uh concerning

840
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,039
um an organization that was not prepared

841
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,399
for a ransomware attack this was a

842
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,240
hospital in germany and i'm sure some of

843
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,840
you have already heard this but

844
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,399
uh their dusadorf university hospital in

845
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,039
germany was attacked by a ransomware

846
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,360
group i don't remember which one exactly

847
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,440
they did it by accident these guys were

848
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,080
targeting the university itself but

849
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,440
instead

850
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,440
breached the network or the hospital of

851
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,960
the university university hospital

852
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,200
network and then launched ransomware on

853
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,960
that network which shut down basically

854
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,399
all their operations they couldn't do

855
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,080
much of anything

856
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,600
and so at the same time that this was

857
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,120
going on a uh a woman who had had a

858
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,600
cardiac event was on her way to the

859
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,000
hospital they turned her away they said

860
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,679
we can't do anything our systems are

861
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:56,720
down we don't know what to do you have

862
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,480
to go to another hospital it's like an

863
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,840
hour away

864
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,120
and so she went to that hospital they

865
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,720
got her an ambulance and she went there

866
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,480
but unfortunately she didn't make it to

867
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,320
that hospital

868
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,039
and

869
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,799
like that's the worst case scenario in

870
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:13,039
my opinion is you somebody dies you know

871
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,919
from a ransomware attack is essentially

872
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,000
uh but regardless even if that

873
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,159
ransomware attack had occurred

874
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,799
if this hospital had a proper plan in

875
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:23,679
place

876
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:24,799
and had

877
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,600
uh you know contingencies on how to

878
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,159
receive or redirect patients or do

879
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:31,840
whatever in case something like that

880
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,480
happens you know i mean this was a cyber

881
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,919
attack but what if the power went out

882
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,360
what if the internet just went out what

883
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,840
if the building was on fire or you know

884
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,919
there was a tornado or something like

885
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,600
there's lots of different you know

886
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,880
reasons why you should come up with a

887
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,480
plan like this

888
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,960
so how can your organizations continue

889
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,440
to operate even if the the systems are

890
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,320
down you know think about that right now

891
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,000
hopefully you have an organization where

892
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,720
you can do things like use pen and paper

893
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,080
or use personal devices uh or something

894
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,760
like that in order to get your work done

895
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,360
um but you need to you know have these

896
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,360
policies rolled out anyway you know what

897
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,360
is your organization's policy on working

898
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,519
from home obviously after the pandemic

899
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,360
i'm sure it's very different from uh

900
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,440
what it was before but nonetheless you

901
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,200
know are you able to do your work from

902
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,480
home you know do you is it too sensitive

903
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,080
uh and you have to be inside of a skiff

904
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,200
for that or

905
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,960
uh you know is there some other way that

906
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,720
you can accomplish this uh or a

907
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,799
different site you can go to work at or

908
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,440
whatever all these things are are really

909
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,000
good information to think about before

910
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
you have to think about

911
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,200
so if you can answer these questions

912
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,960
make the document available to all

913
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,200
necessary employees as well as hopefully

914
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,679
perform a few simulated attacks you're

915
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,840
going to have a lot easier time when it

916
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,080
comes to recovery and be a lot more

917
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,399
successful in your defense saving a lot

918
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,399
of time and money at least you know we

919
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:59,959
expect it to be

920
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,559
so uh kind of to wrap this up ransomware

921
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,600
it's not going anywhere uh it's far too

922
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,440
lucrative of an endeavor at least for

923
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,080
now to abandon okay every year that goes

924
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,159
by ransomware takes a slightly different

925
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,799
form uh that creates a bigger headache

926
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,720
for the rest of us and at the end of the

927
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,559
day they're counting on us to make

928
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,559
mistakes and to misconfigure our

929
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,640
networks and to ignore our security

930
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,640
enough to give them an in

931
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,559
so the goal here is to not give them

932
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,120
that in you know as much as you can

933
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,320
uh

934
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,320
i think that the biggest takeaway from

935
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,799
this entire talk honestly is the the

936
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,080
idea

937
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,799
and the effort of of seeing ransomware

938
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,640
as uh almost like a force of nature okay

939
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,440
um we've seen them come through

940
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,840
fishing the basic ways you know fishing

941
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,799
exploits brute forcing okay fine and now

942
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,720
we're seeing ransomware coming through

943
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,279
uh application or msp you know

944
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,360
application update processes we've seen

945
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,320
ransomware i think it was not petsia the

946
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,000
they came right after wannacry that

947
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,960
attacked the uh a ukrainian accounting

948
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,760
firm

949
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,399
and was able to hijack their update

950
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,960
process to spread their ransomware to

951
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,240
all users of that software

952
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,480
uh most of which were in ukraine and

953
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,919
that was the whole point uh but

954
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,840
regardless i mean this that's that's a

955
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,080
supply chain attack you know what we saw

956
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,480
with the cassaya vsa attack

957
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,399
also a supply chain attack in a way or

958
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,080
another um and we're seeing more and

959
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,760
more of this you know the criminals are

960
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,640
less

961
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,600
about

962
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,840
uh you know putting up just more and

963
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,640
more

964
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,519
um

965
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:36,799
you know names on the side of their

966
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,120
fighter jet they they want

967
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,200
to be able to attack lots of people with

968
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,120
limited effort uh and that's what we're

969
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,399
seeing kind of them going in that

970
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,399
direction as well

971
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,840
so if you do happen to get infected with

972
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,600
ransomware make sure that you

973
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,159
communicate with local law enforcement

974
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,320
you know the information obtained

975
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,480
from your case might help prevent future

976
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,200
cases and or take down the criminals

977
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,600
behind the attack i know a lot of when i

978
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,120
mentioned earlier in the presentation

979
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,039
that law enforcement has taken down

980
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,799
multiple families

981
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,280
over the last year um a lot of that

982
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,480
information

983
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,320
and the data that he used to the

984
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,760
intelligence they gathered in order to

985
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,079
do these things uh was obtained from

986
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,599
from cases of people being hit by

987
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,839
ransomware and working with law

988
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:20,960
enforcement to give them more

989
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,520
information give them help in some

990
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,440
attribution you know

991
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,399
uh

992
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:30,159
and and it made a pretty big difference

993
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,960
so preparedness is the key here and the

994
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,679
point of this talk entirely if you

995
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,440
expect a ransomware attack you can

996
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,918
modify your infrastructure security or

997
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,239
operations to greatly reduce the

998
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,440
downtime damage and costs from such an

999
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,440
attack and in the end prevent your

1000
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,079
organization from being infected by most

1001
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,800
malware being spread today

1002
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,200
so you know this this talk started as

1003
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,800
ransomware and you know that's the main

1004
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,480
focus here but

1005
