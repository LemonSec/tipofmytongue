hands or at least those that are

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,719
interested in improving their hunting

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,359
skills you've probably seen this kind of

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,240
a title page before today

29
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,040
since it's a day of remembrance

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,439
so i won't belabor the point but

31
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,760
to just comment um there's a special

32
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,119
reason why you're gonna why we're

33
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,200
showing this today our company

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,159
um

35
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,119
and it's not just because um

36
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,360
uh 20 years ago we were under attack

37
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,560
physically

38
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,200
we're under attack from uh in a cyber

39
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,000
war today and the reason this is

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,560
especially important to our company

41
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,759
is because

42
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,520
the name of our company comes from that

43
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,880
dick and let me see if i can get my

44
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,479
screen to work here

45
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,119
name of our company is 418 intelligence

46
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,079
and

47
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,000
um so i won't spend too much time on

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,960
this but

49
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,840
418 comes from 911 418 stands for

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,119
april 18 1772

51
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,439
and if you understood what happened in

52
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,240
911 as a failure of intelligence

53
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,680
um on the night of april 18 1775 that

54
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,640
was

55
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,040
considered by many to be one of the most

56
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,959
successful and the first um true um

57
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,840
intelligence networks working in america

58
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,400
because that was the night of the

59
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,319
midnight ride of paul revere and the two

60
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,720
lanterns coming out of the north church

61
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,800
old north church in boston

62
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,800
the purpose for that being the

63
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,280
inspiration for our name is we are a

64
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,959
kind of modern day

65
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,840
um militia band of people that

66
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,760
understand what's happening

67
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,480
and are observing cyber attacks to

68
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,680
to inform

69
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,319
um where those attacks are coming from

70
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,120
and um and what to do about them so we

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,200
borrowed our name specifically as a

72
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,160
positive counterpoint to 911 it just

73
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,400
happens that that's the day today that

74
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,239
we remember the attacks

75
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,760
and so i wanted you to have that

76
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,480
background because it sets the stage for

77
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,560
what we're doing as a

78
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,760
crowd source cyber

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,360
cyber

80
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,560

but just tell you the company

90
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,200
was spun out of work that was originally

91
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,760
done by the intelligence community to to

92
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,640
look at how to do a better job of

93
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,040
making decisions on intelligence

94
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,879
and to not make those same types of

95
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,840
mistakes that cause intelligence

96
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,200
uh to be overlooked um in the attack on

97
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,440

out educational programs to get more

130
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800

he joined our first cohort in tradecraft

170
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,319
as a pilot to see if our platform and

171
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,199
some

172
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,240
uh some training that we specialize in

173
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,919
around uh

174
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,720
adversary tradecraft and coaching with

175
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,319
people like ted

176
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,280
could

177
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,039
could solve that problem of how do you

178
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,000
find

179
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,800
jobs for people that are in a rural

180
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,039
section of the country that are trying

181
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,720
to do cyber work and have never done

182
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,360
that before and so i'll fast forward six

183
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,639
months later

184
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,240
um brian

185
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,400
um had a job

186
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,039
that he has today as a remote cyber

187
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,520
analyst working for a managed security

188
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,639
services

189
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,960
provider starting at a little over sixty

190
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,360
thousand dollars as an entry level wage

191
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,759
that's more than double the average of

192
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,199
his county

193
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,560
um his entire county's average salary

194
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,000
and it

195
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,840
and at this point it allowed brian to

196
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,960
even buy his first home so this is what

197
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,199
we're what we're doing with our

198
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,440
technology today is finding

199
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,160
ways to give jobs and bring skills to

200
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,840
people like brian

201
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,039
so they can get

202
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,280
their first jobs or develop their skills

203
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,879
as cyber hunters

204
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,759
i i feel like what we've got today is a

205
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,720
trap

206
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,560
that the cyber crisis

207
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,639
is causing us not only

208
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,520
um

209
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,080
not only to to be under attack as we set

210
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,039
up front

211
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,879
but because tens of thousands of

212
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,080
americans

213
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,039
today are looking to find one of those

214
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,080
500 000 jobs you've probably heard about

215
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,960
that are vacant in cyber security

216
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,039
but they're blocked by that or they're

217
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,080
unable to do that because 95 of those

218
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,840
jobs are waiting for someone with proven

219
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,680
hands-on experience

220
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,319
usually prior experience in economic

221
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,400
terms that's about 50 billion dollars

222
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,360
that is persistently on the sideline

223
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,958
that could be in circulation in the

224
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,640
economy not to speak of the amount of

225
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,200
skill that could be out there engaging

226
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,159
attackers every day so this is a huge

227
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,320
tragedy for the country

228
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,080
we've achieved what we think is a

229
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,600
breakthrough and we want to tell you

230
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,680
about that today since some of you

231
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,600
might be looking to have this same kind

232
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,959
of experience that we've given to brian

233
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,640
we've achieved a breakthrough in how

234
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,160
we've found a way to bring live data

235
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,600
real time

236
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,000
in a continuous sport collaboration

237
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,959
experience to people that are interns

238
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,399
that have not been

239
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,279
cyber analysts before but that are

240
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,440
allowed to go through an experience

241
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,880
which gives them

242
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,680
every bit the same experience as a true

243
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,720
cyber analyst and lets them

244
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,120
do that in a gamified way so it's it's

245
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,480
engaging and it draws you in and by the

246
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,040
end of an experience with us they've got

247
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,120
hands-on rated skills and so far they're

248
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,720
we're having great success in them

249
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,880
getting straight into the workforce

250
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,920
because they can use this experience

251
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,279
to talk

252
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,800
with the secret handshake that the

253
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,959
employer is looking for an understanding

254
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,279
of the real world of cyber threat

255
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,760
and what those mean to analyze them with

256
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,839
what it means in order to mitigate them

257
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,800
that's what's unique and it's

258
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,279
absolutely groundbreaking and brand new

259
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,920
so quickly our results and we want to

260
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,240
show you how this really works in a live

261
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,040
demonstration but over 80 percent of

262
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,640
that first cohort

263
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,480
that brian was one of

264
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,959
that were all unemployed all working in

265
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,800
the coal fields or living in the coal

266
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,480
fields of kentucky

267
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,320
uh were hired in that first pilot that

268
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,560
ended just a few months ago in at the

269
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,320
end of june this year

270
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,480
none had prior experience and they are

271
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,800
remote cyber threat analysts today

272
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,200
working for companies in houston in

273
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,399
chicago

274
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,440
making

275
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,880
mid-60s and having a life-altering

276
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,360
experience at the same time

277
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,480
this approach which is really about kind

278
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,519
of community defense has started to

279
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,839
penetrate the local employers in

280
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:46,959
kentucky

281
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,200
their largest wireless providers now

282
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,480
starting a pilot with us uh to explore

283
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,160
using our our approach to to to defend

284
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,959
their community of small businesses that

285
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,440
use their their systems and their and

286
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,440
their connectivity

287
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,079
so very quickly this is what this

288
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,839
approach looks like

289
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,399
you've got and in the center our

290
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,720
platform called foresight and what's

291
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,360
critical in this picture

292
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,440
for you to think about is

293
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,160
the people that are working our platform

294
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,000
just like brian we're all student

295
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,519
analysts they're engaged live with

296
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,160
using data that comes directly out of a

297
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,760
couple sources i'll show you one of

298
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,760
those in the next section of this

299
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,200
presentation

300
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,640
but uh today the concentration is live

301
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,519
fishing threat data so live threshing

302
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,920
phishing threat data comes to us in our

303
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,839
platform within minutes of it having

304
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:44,560
been

305
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,560
having appeared on someone's desktop

306
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,600
that's in a

307
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,440
community population

308
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,880
and by working together and with experts

309
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,920
they can like like ted they can

310
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,720
understand and analyze a cyber threat

311
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,800
and come up with a mitigation plan this

312
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,959
is how they can

313
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,360
essentially have an experience that's

314
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,880
equal to a security analyst to get that

315
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,200
that uh over that hurdle with an

316
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,079
employer or with a in a first interview

317
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,760
that they actually understand that

318
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,760
secret handshake

319
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,839
so keep that keep this picture in mind

320
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,399
because we're gonna now introduce to you

321
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,800
this the first part of this experience

322
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,720
which is how do you

323
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,880
um how do you get access to real live

324
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,040
data and if and if things go well i'm

325
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,959
going to click on this link and we're

326
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,800
going to see a recorded video from terry

327
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,000
mccorkle

328
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,760
the founder and ceo of fish cloud which

329
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,000
is our partner that we integrate with

330
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,240
that brings phishing data directly in

331
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,200
real time to our foresight platform keep

332
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,720
your fingers crossed

333
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,200
at least this worked before

334
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,600
all right looks like we're going to have

335
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,120
success

336
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,360
and

337
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,120
i'm not seeing it

338
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,360
on the screen though i think maybe it's

339
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,160
on a different monitor

340
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,720
did you tell me you couldn't can't see

341
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,279
that right now i don't see the video

342
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,360
okay let me see if i can change my

343
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,320
sharing

344
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,120
and we'll get to that

345
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,399
uh escape hang on a second

346
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,560
can you see my screen now ted

347
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,040
no

348
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,800
let's try this

349
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,360
if this doesn't work we'll just have to

350
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,760
wing it one second everybody sorry for

351
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,920
the

352
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,800
sorry for the prop

353
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,399
now

354
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,279
yep

355
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,480
okay great we're alive thank you for the

356
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,959
patience

357
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,480
you can't hear it though

358
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,920
you can't hear him no

359
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,639
okay this is a i've had this zoom

360
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,399
problem before it's a video it's a

361
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,560
setting in zoom you can bear with me

362
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,720
everyone will try and get this fixed

363
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,320
otherwise we'll just talk through it

364
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,240
back over to zoom

365
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,719
can you hear us

366
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,040
where

367
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,639
yes we can

368
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,120
so when you share your

369
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,279
at the bottom of stream zoom screen

370
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,279
before you click share make sure both of

371
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,560
those are checked

372
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,680
that can possibly flip your audio

373
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,399
so it should say optimize

374
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,839
video for

375
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,320
sharing

376
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,560
make sure both of those boxes are

377
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,440
checked

378
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,160
and then share your screen

379
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,600
that might get your audio back

380
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,759
um

381
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,839
but is it in the share advanced sharing

382
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,240
links

383
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,920
so you just click the the normal share

384
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,839
screen button and it brings up like the

385
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,519
various desktops you can share or

386
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,680
whatever at the bottom there's a share

387
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,720
sound check box oh i see it there thank

388
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,160
you

389
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,040
god

390
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,600
let's see if this works down

391
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,680
and share a little bit about what we're

392
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,440
doing to empower people in cyber

393
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,639
security

394
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,839
my background with multiple decades in

395
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,680
cyber security now

396
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,320
i was i spent a lot of time actually

397
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,800
doing red teaming and pen testing and

398
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,279
sending phishing attacks and

399
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,120
some of the things we learned led to us

400
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,120
understanding that if people are given

401
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,880
the opportunity and given the right

402
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,360
tools they will oftentimes make better

403
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,800
decisions

404
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,399
so today i'm going to show you very

405
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,440
quickly

406
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,759
uh what we developed and how that ties

407
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,000
into what mark's about to show you we're

408
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,079
very excited to be working with mark and

409
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,040
his team and should be able to bring new

410
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,480
innovations to the world that you're

411
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,000
about to see

412
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,519
so fish cloud

413
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,440
has been developed so that

414
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,000
people can have real time indicators in

415
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,720
any application they use on the desktop

416
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,440
and

417
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,600
give them the real-time notifications

418
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,399
and ability to check and unshorten any

419
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,040
link on the internet and get real-time

420
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,079
feedback

421
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,800
now in order to do that we also made

422
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,959
sure we focused on privacy and we

423
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,919
focused on anonymization so our endpoint

424
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,359
solution allows us to have an

425
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,359
anonymization layer which means we don't

426
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,880
have to collect any additional

427
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,039
information and we can use a tagging

428
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,199
system to let our com our partner

429
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,520
companies know what's going on so here's

430
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,799
an example

431
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,240
in duck in for example edge using bing

432
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,199
and this is firefox using duckduckgo

433
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,319
and another example in outlook desktop

434
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,039
now the point of this is users are

435
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,559
now being

436
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,120
seeing threats from many different

437
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,160
sources

438
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,559
and we're set up so that we can actually

439
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,880
help understand those sources help the

440
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,799
users be better at detecting what's

441
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:43,919
going on

442
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,080
and then in real time through our

443
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,039
anonymized network we're able to share

444
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,039
that information with analysts so that

445
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,799
they can very quickly

446
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,799
get eyes on it understand if it's a

447
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,880
threat and get it back out to our

448
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,520
community in real time so our green

449
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,240
yellow red motif allows our entire

450
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,039
partner ecosystem to update those links

451
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,120
and verify whether it's safe or not in

452
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,520
real time all the way back down to the

453
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,240
desktop so hopefully that gives you a

454
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,160
good understanding of what fish cloud is

455
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,480
doing and how we work with mark

456
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,559
again very excited to be here and very

457
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,720
excited to be working with him

458
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,280
to to help train the next generation of

459
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,600
cyber security analysts and bring new

460
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,080
capabilities to the cyber security world

461
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,600
thank you

462
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,200
hey thank you i'm going to jump back

463
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,760
over to the presentation and we'll pick

464
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,120
that up right

465
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,120
right from there um

466
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,280
so let me let me just mention while i'm

467
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,400
doing that

468
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,280
uh

469
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,280
you saw some some links some

470
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,799
uh you saw some

471
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,440
uh green boxes around some of the links

472
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,559
if you were

473
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,799
paying attention during the video

474
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,200
what we're gonna show you is when those

475
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,039
boxes are yellow

476
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,760
essentially when there's uh when a link

477
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,039
is

478
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,200
no

479
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,360
those links come directly into this

480
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,919
platform called foresight that's how we

481
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,120
give

482
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,240
people that that are in these internship

483
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,440
programs uh or analysts a live

484
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,160
experience with live links so what terry

485
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,200
showed you

486
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,600
means the real threats that are hitting

487
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,360
browsers hitting inboxes on people's

488
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,640
desktops

489
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,120
our event are evaluated in real time red

490
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,039
yellow or green and if they're unknown

491
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,799
if they're new links to the world which

492
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,120
is typically why they're yellow they

493
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,799
come immediately over to this platform

494
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,440
and this platform will typically receive

495
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,480
one of those threats within about five

496
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,720
minutes of it having been first seen on

497
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,440
a desktop and what's what's also

498
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,160
important is the concept of community

499
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,760
defense because

500
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,000
that technology you just saw

501
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,600
can be present on desktops with

502
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,559
data being shared back to us anonymously

503
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,400
from any endpoint in other words from

504
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,880
any desktop it can be it can be

505
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,720
different companies it can be different

506
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,400
individuals

507
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,799
in our case for this first pilot

508
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,679
these were the desktops of staff of the

509
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,000
kentucky community and technical college

510
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,640
system that we were using their data to

511
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,520
give our interns this first experience

512
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,280
in this live threat hunting

513
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,000
so

514
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,320
what's what happens then is after

515
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,280
evaluation in our platform of an unknown

516
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,840
link that might be containing something

517
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,159
serious like a ransomware attack

518
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,480
that assessment goes immediately back to

519
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,840
all of those users and stops them from

520
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,640
seeing that particular threat so it's a

521
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,000
real time

522
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,039
real world round trip

523
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,240
defense system using this platform in

524
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,559
the middle with humans looking at those

525
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,840
new threats before the systems that are

526
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,480
available to say antivirus or phishing

527
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,360
gateways have seen them so we call

528
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,880
foresight

529
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,159
quickly

530
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,799
you know it is a crowd source or a

531
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,039
collective uh approach to cyber analysis

532
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,720
these links here that you see on the

533
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,880
screen are actual real phishing links

534
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,360
when the screenshot was taken so these

535
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,880
aren't stimulated

536
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,000
this one we're suggesting has a bounty

537
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,159
which we can offer so you've probably

538
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,559
just heard casey ellis talk about bug

539
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,200
bounties and bug crowd think about this

540
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,360
being the very first threat bounty or

541
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,240
breach bounty where we can apply money

542
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,280
to a crowd-sourced approach that is

543
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,760
compensated for finding an actual

544
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,080
ransomware attack or something like that

545
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,159
that's happening in a network

546
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,559
that's possible in our platform we

547
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,159
gamify the experience by using points

548
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,360
for um analysts to use to judge the

549
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,440
likelihood that they determine

550
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,600
whether you know some answer to a

551
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,559
question which typically is is something

552
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,039
malicious or threatening and those

553
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,080
scores are pulled together in real time

554
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,679
and at the same time they collaborate

555
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,799
with us

556
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:11,600
so

557
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,799
keep this

558
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,880
in mind we're going to jump now to ted's

559
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,120
part of the presentation he's going to

560
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,480
show you a real

561
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,760
um a real demo of a threat that was

562
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,240
current just yesterday to give you that

563
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,240
you know put a press upon you this is

564
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,120
live

565
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,760
data that we work with and just how this

566
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,600
um how this happened

567
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,240
so ted i'm gonna hand over to you

568
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,480
okay

569
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,639
all right so

570
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,000
um are you able to see my screen

571
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,760
i can see it okay great so as mark uh

572
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,520
said this is a real fish um or potential

573
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,559
fish

574
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,400
url that was seen in the system

575
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,120
yesterday and so

576
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,360
i'm just gonna go through here some of

577
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,559
the the steps that we train our interns

578
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,080
or our analysts to go through now

579
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,240
keeping in mind that these are in many

580
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,400
cases folks who have little

581
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,960
very little i.t experience um you know

582
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,120
coming into the program and so you'll

583
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,280
get a a sense of the kinds of skills

584
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,679
that they're able to impart to them

585
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:20,480
so

586
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,760
in this case the url that was seen was

587
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,880
super dash ict.nl

588
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,120
help x.xy

589
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,799
if you go to the base url super ict.nl

590
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,039
you see this thing here

591
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,600
i don't retouch but uh there's this help

592
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,799
desk button right here and if i were to

593
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,320
actually click on that i'll go ahead and

594
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,120
click on it but so it's it

595
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,799
asks me if i want to allow downloads

596
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,279
right i'm not going to in this case but

597
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,360
you'll see that if i had allowed that it

598
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,080
would have downloaded an executable you

599
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,720
can easily see this as being

600
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,120
a phishing attack it might also be

601
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,919
coupled with something like a fake

602
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,919
phone based you know phone call that's a

603
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,200
fake support scam type of attack

604
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,799
where they would have you

605
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,480
go to this website and download this

606
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,080
help desk application right

607
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,840
so yesterday i went through a basic sort

608
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,200
of

609
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,919
analysis or investigation of this

610
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,799
potential fish and i recorded a video of

611
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,880
it i'm going to walk through it with you

612
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,840
now

613
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,080
keeping in mind this is not all in real

614
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,080
time i edited some stuff out where you

615
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,679
know we're just waiting for progress

616
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,039
bars to to run and so on but so

617
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,559
you might start with something very

618
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,480
basic like going and just doing a who is

619
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,799
look up on the base url um and so the

620
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,120
analyst might start here and go and look

621
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,720
at okay where is this is it the

622
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,919
netherlands how old is this what kind of

623
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,440
indicators do we have that this might be

624
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,520
a malicious so we might look at things

625
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,039
like how old is the actual uh website or

626
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,880
how old is the domain this is actually

627
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,200
pretty old so um that's not a really

628
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,360
strong indicator there but then we might

629
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,200
go over to url scan or or a similar

630
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,320
platform and enter the domain there and

631
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,679
see what it says

632
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,840
and we can see that it's been scanned by

633
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,679
other folks recently

634
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,360
might go and look here and see what

635
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,840
kinds of indicators there are there

636
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,880
and then

637
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,960
we might actually go and scan the full

638
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,559
url that includes the executable uh

639
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,880
that's to be downloaded right and then

640
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,880
again this is not in real time i kind of

641
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,960
edited a little bit of this out but

642
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,200
you'll see that you can it comes back

643
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,559
and it uh

644
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,240
in this case url

645
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,559
scan.io

646
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,600
gives you a shot 256 hash of the

647
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,400
executable and it also feeds it to virus

648
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,279
total

649
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,159
um

650
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,400
so we can then look and see

651
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
what other um

652
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,600
what virus

653
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,520
says about it if it's been scanned there

654
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,159
and virustotal tells us that 13 security

655
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,679
vendors have flagged this particular

656
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,520
file as being malicious

657
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,840
um so you know we could actually

658
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,080
probably stop right there as an analyst

659
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,400
and say hey this is probably malicious

660
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,120
but um just in the in for the sake of

661
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,200
kind of completeness here i i continued

662
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,880
on as if you know we kind of had didn't

663
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,960
know that right so or we wanted to

664
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,840
further um evaluate ourselves so here i

665
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,919
went and actually downloaded the real

666
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,840
executable in a vm so this is um

667
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,919
you know a forensic type of vm it's set

668
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,679
up this is actually just the the fireeye

669
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,400
flair vm so running it through detect it

670
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,039
easy you can see here that it's got an

671
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,760
embedded zip file inside of it which is

672
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,480
kind of unusual um you might look at

673
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,320
things like the strings that are inside

674
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,480
the executable

675
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,240
you know we can scroll through these and

676
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,000
a lot of them are not going to be very

677
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,320
recognizable but what i would typically

678
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,000
do then is go through and enter a filter

679
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,840
look for things like references to

680
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,000
executables so if we do that we can see

681
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,919
that there's actually something called

682
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,159
oneclickvnc.exe

683
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,039
in here um there's referenced in the

684
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,279
executable so that's another indicator

685
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,760
that's kind of suspicious i'd also look

686
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,679
for things like configuration

687
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,360
strings i didn't see any or setting

688
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,679
strings now here in this settings string

689
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,039
the second one there might be a little

690
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,279
hard to see but it looks like there's

691
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,600
actually an embedded uh socket

692
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,200
information there so it looks like maybe

693
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,760
an ip address and a port number uh which

694
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,480
i would take note of and and

695
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,279
look for later as well as looks like

696
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,039
it's probably going to drop this

697
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,080
executable one click vnc.exe

698
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,840
uh into

699
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,320
our temp directory for this machine um

700
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,720
so other so these are more clues for us

701
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,799
to look at later right but there's

702
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,039
there's the socket or the the socket

703
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,880
information

704
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,240
um

705
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,799
we might also then the analyst might

706
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,080
also then

707
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,760
use other tools to look at this thing um

708
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,960
so

709
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,960
let's see here like

710
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,279
oh so setting making sure that we're

711
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,880
using the host only adapter to uh

712
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,880
isolate our

713
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,120
victim machine initially from the

714
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,799
internet and then um you know go ahead

715
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:17,600
and

716
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,480
and get ready to detonate this thing um

717
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,000
so we might start up something like

718
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,399
procmon from sysinternals and uh filter

719
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,880
set up a filter so that we're only

720
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,880
looking at the things that

721
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,480
uh that help.xe actually starts right so

722
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,399
otherwise we're gonna have lots and lots

723
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,780
of noise um

724
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,240
[Music]

725
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,360
then

726
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,000
we would set up um

727
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,200
another thing like like process explorer

728
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,320
um and we might start up wireshark so

729
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,880
that we're ready to see whether

730
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,360
the this particular suspected piece of

731
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,200
malware is trying to make outbound

732
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,559
connections you might start pe studio to

733
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,720
look a little more in-depth that's doing

734
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,520
some static analysis um before we

735
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,200
detonate this thing so

736
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,919
um you can drag and drop that executable

737
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,360
into

738
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,880
studio and then look at things like

739
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,919
um

740
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:20,799
you know the the headers um looking for

741
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,679
atypical types of names of headers or

742
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,919
resources in the this thing so we can

743
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,960
see here i pause this that there's this

744
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,600
section upx one right there's also a upx

745
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,840
zero if we look at it um so we know that

746
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,720
this is a packed binary which is also a

747
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,039
an indicator that it might be a piece of

748
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,440
malware um

749
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,480
might look for other types of indicators

750
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,200
within the binary you know we go over a

751
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,360
very basic malware

752
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,200
analysis for our students we certainly

753
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,679
don't expect them to become

754
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,880
experts at reverse engineering binaries

755
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,720
right in the in the short training

756
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,399
period that we give them but we give

757
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,000
them enough skills to be able to do

758
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,080
things like use these types of tools and

759
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,320
look for common indicators or red flags

760
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,039
so in this case looking at that some of

761
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,080
the

762
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,080
language indicators in here we see

763
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,080
there's there's russian strings in here

764
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,799
so that's an indicator this might be

765
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,200
something of interest

766
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,039
and so on we can also see

767
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,799
at the bottom there there's an overlay

768
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:23,679
again

769
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:24,799
ver

770
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,200
validating for us that this there is a

771
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,840
pk zip element that's embedded into this

772
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,960
binary um which is a good indicator that

773
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,559
there might be something afoot um

774
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,039
so then once we we kind of are again

775
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,760
we're this is you know a very rapid look

776
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,840
at things right if we were to find

777
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,440
things of more interest and we could

778
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,360
certainly uh do a much deeper dive into

779
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,960
these things and of course depending on

780
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,440
on the experience level of the analyst

781
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,320
they'd be able to do additional analysis

782
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,240
and so on um

783
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,559
but then we can basically get to the

784
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,799
point where uh we're ready to

785
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,760
uh go uh pe study also allows us to look

786
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,600
at other types of indicators here which

787
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,640
gives

788
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,200
a little a little assistance to less

789
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,720
experienced analysts

790
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,240
um

791
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,240
but then once we've kind of gone through

792
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,559
the steps of doing as much static

793
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,679
analysis as we can for this particular

794
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,480
binary then we can jump into doing uh

795
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,640
more uh into actually getting ready to

796
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,200
detonate this thing so um

797
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,240
we

798
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,880
again let's start up wireshark let's get

799
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,760
it listening um on its on the local

800
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,960
ethernet or the the virtualized ethernet

801
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,279
interface right um

802
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:45,039
let's start capture in process monitor

803
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,080
and then go ahead and and just execute

804
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,159
this thing and see what happens right

805
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,559
um and so we can immediately a whole see

806
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,960
a whole bunch of events starts spawned

807
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,919
there

808
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,840
in process monitor you can see that this

809
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,120
this uh

810
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,840
screen popped up letting us know this is

811
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,080
pretty amateur right but it's letting us

812
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,840
know that uh it's actually started a vnc

813
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,480
server running on our machine um which

814
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,960
is why i suspect that for this to work

815
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,720
it probably needs to be

816
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,720
coupled with something like one of those

817
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,880
fake uh voice

818
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,360
voice calls that's a support scam type

819
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,440
of call um

820
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,039
so that someone's talking you through

821
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,120
this on the phone as you start to run

822
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,960
this thing but we can then see here in

823
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,159
the process tree in procmond the various

824
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,000
sub processes that get spawned here

825
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,960
including win vnc so that's our vnc

826
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,279
remote control server that's running you

827
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,279
can see the actual command that gets run

828
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,519
there and so on um

829
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,360
and over in wireshark we can look at

830
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,000
some of the the network activity over

831
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,799
there

832
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,760
then what we might do is uh run this

833
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,799
again

834
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,200
with the you know with

835
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,679
the actual virtual ma

836
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,399
virtual network interface

837
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,440
enabled

838
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,279
to actually access the internet so we

839
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,360
can see

840
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,480
additional

841
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,960
network traffic information there let's

842
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,840
see here real quick

843
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,480
um

844
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,840
not getting my video playback

845
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,480
controls here okay well so we're gonna

846
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,559
enable this as an added um adapter now

847
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,039
and then run this again and we'll see

848
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:35,840
that

849
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,640
we can actually observe

850
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,559
in trying to do some

851
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,879
um

852
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,720
trying to actually do

853
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,679
get in control or inc connected to a

854
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,240
command and control node

855
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,240
um

856
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:54,799
so

857
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,440
this will give you a sense of the kinds

858
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,960
of skills that we're um we're giving to

859
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,640
our

860
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,600
let me speed this up a little

861
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,079
um

862
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,679
give you a sense of some of the the

863
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,000
skills we're giving to

864
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,040
our our interns right um

865
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,918
so

866
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:21,839
let's just run this again real quick

867
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,119
okay so

868
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,440
as now we can see that actually it's

869
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,359
connecting to or it's trying to connect

870
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,079
to

871
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:38,480
80.101.84.110 which by the way is the ip

872
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,239
address that was listed within the

873
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,000
binary when we're looking at the strings

874
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,399
inside the binary right so this is a

875
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,599
strong indicator there um or where

876
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,040
there's it's good information there that

877
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,760
we could then do additional re research

878
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,719
on that particular ip address and so on

879
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,020
um

880
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,159
[Music]

881
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,440
and then so you know we kind of we teach

882
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,839
the interns how to do this sort of stuff

883
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:04,400
sort of the hard way like this and then

884
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,880
we also teach them how to use uh

885
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,040
leverage other online types of resources

886
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,440
like any run um

887
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,480
and so

888
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,280
you know that um oh here's an example of

889
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,640
how to use

890
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,800
red shot right so we would have

891
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,280
snapshotted the registry at the front

892
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,440
and then we snapshot it at the end we

893
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,760
take a look at the zillions of changes

894
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,760
that are made in the registry and we

895
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,680
chase down some of those you research

896
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,480
those use those as indicators and so on

897
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,440
um

898
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,720
so i

899
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,560
there's a bit more to this video but i

900
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,160
think i'll stop it here this gives you

901
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,440
kind of the the general idea of what we

902
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,670
can do um

903
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,760
[Music]

904
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,000
but um you know this is the types of

905
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,079
skills again that we're providing to

906
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,880
folks who have had very little exposure

907
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,240
to cyber if any at all and really gives

908
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,839
them enough skills to very quickly

909
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:58,880
triage and

910
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,040
investigate a potential

911
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,839
phishing or a potential

912
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,440
exploitative

913
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,320
and malicious site or file

914
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,720
and then immediately feed that back into

915
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,320
the system and feed that back into fish

916
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,200
cloud which as mark alluded to then

917
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,040
gives real-time feedback to users and uh

918
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,960
you know it gives them will turn that

919
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,680
unknown link from a yellow to a red so

920
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,560
that

921
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,720
all future users know that that's a

922
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,680
malicious unsafe link

923
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,480
um so with that let me turn this back

924
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,079
over to you mark

925
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,320
okay i'm gonna grab i'm gonna go back to

926
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,680
the presentation i think

927
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,000
i'm going to go to my live demo and show

928
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,359
you what it looks like when we're

929
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,079
running um fish cloud i'm sorry when

930
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,599
we're running foresight live i'll give

931
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,680
you a quick intro

932
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,560
that wasn't what i wanted

933
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,079
that's

934
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,720
one second i've gotta try and get

935
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,959
away from that screen

936
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,119
here

937
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,079
never ease

938
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,920
okay so i think you all can

939
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,800
um so this is the site this is the

940
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,920
actual uh site that ed was just talking

941
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,240
you through it was you can see there's a

942
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,800
leaderboard over here so we score people

943
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,160
and they get they

944
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,640
they score up and down the leaderboard

945
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,800
this is you're looking at live

946
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,640
live you know this is a live demo right

947
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,880
now on our site

948
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,000
this is the site uh he was looking at it

949
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,760
was delivered to us

950
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,040
uh just

951
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,320
yesterday so it was a brand new fishing

952
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,480
threat yesterday that we looked at to

953
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,160
investigate whether it was

954
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,839
serious because it showed downloading

955
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,320
behavior we investigated it further i'm

956
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,480
going to focus on that question and give

957
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,079
you a sense of what an analyst does

958
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,640
after he's done what ted just did he

959
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,640
walks through and puts in judgments on

960
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,520
uh

961
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,119
on judgments on

962
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,119
the assessment that they've been asked

963
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,960
to perform what's your confidence that

964
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,520
this site is malicious in this case it

965
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,599
had the exe download along with it

966
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,040
and they they

967
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,440
contribute as they go through

968
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,440
making judgments from

969
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,960
and they're always asked to evaluate

970
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,200
things in terms of probabilities so it

971
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,560
started as a 60 50 probability a coin

972
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,320
flip of being malicious

973
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,280
our intelligence ana background

974
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,359
analyzer came up with a 60 probability

975
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:44,640
that gets uploaded into our platform and

976
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,240
activated

977
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,599
with a reason

978
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,839
but this was only 23 hours ago that's

979
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,839
true

980
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,720
two hours later it had been picked up by

981
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,200
the analyst the analyst

982
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,440
saw a dnc server this would be ted in

983
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,640
this case

984
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,960
looking for remote control so change the

985
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,760
probability of maliciousness upwards to

986
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,520
85 percent

987
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:13,040
and found later russian binary strings

988
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,920
with attempts to reach out to c2 so

989
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,079
pretty conclusive that this is the

990
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,880
malicious site when that's done

991
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,760
that individual large gazelle everyone

992
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,280
gets a code name

993
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,480
has been uh credited on their trading

994
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,880
account with the with basically an

995
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,200
expected value of their bets being

996
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,920
correct or their inputs being correct so

997
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,800
immediate feedback on what their score

998
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,040
looks like relative to everybody else

999
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,040
that hits directly and immediately in

1000
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,480
the live in the leaderboard as well

1001
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,200
and then they submit their findings

1002
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,839
through a series of case notes

1003
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:52,800
so

1004
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,839
here's

1005
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,599
um here's a case note that was sent

1006
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,280
submitted by

1007
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,400
uh directly on the url scan page that

1008
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,720
you probably saw when ted looked at it

1009
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,640
so you can go through as a

1010
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,880
as a collaborator or as an as a

1011
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,920
as a coach or a manager and see exactly

1012
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,520
what people are doing

1013
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,119
they get the experience of working

1014
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,359
directly in a stock

1015
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:23,119
they get to collaborate with others

1016
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,400
in a

1017
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,720
we call collaboration so they can chat

1018
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,119
directly they can chat with people from

1019
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,599
across the world in the first time we

1020
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,200
did this we had

1021
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,560
we had analysts in louisiana

1022
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,960
that were college students working with

1023
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,520
securities operations center

1024
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,200
analysts in india

1025
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,280
uh and in london

1026
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,079
collaborating to find another russian

1027
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,480
malware site the next time we did this

1028
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,720
with our kentucky

1029
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,040
interns which was really our first

1030
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,160
full-time run at it they found within

1031
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,920
the first week

1032
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,880
a campaign coming out of china live live

1033
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,880
data live threats

1034
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,319
change is really the nature of the

1035
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:07,920
experience they have

1036
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,359
because they see what happens in the

1037
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,520
real world so all those skills they're

1038
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,560
taught as an analyst and stimulators can

1039
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,720
be brought to bear in the real live

1040
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,119
world collaborating with experts that

1041
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,680
work jointly in this platform they can

1042
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,480
reach out to on the fly to get help

1043
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,280
that's so and that works by

1044
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,400
a

1045
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,960
mechanism similar to

1046
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,960
how you would um

1047
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,599
how you would direct message someone say

1048
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:36,319
in

1049
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:37,839
um

1050
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:39,520
in slack for example if you're familiar

1051
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,040
with that platform

1052
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,119
so if i were to complete the step i'm on

1053
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,200
right now i'd be sending a direct

1054
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,640
message to

1055
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,960
large gazelle which is a code name that

1056
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,920
ted has in this case and i'd be sending

1057
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,800
him a message to to take some action you

1058
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,839
can see

1059
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,760
that's what's happened in these comments

1060
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,720
here

1061
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,720
most recently

1062
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,319
you know a question about whether this

1063
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:03,359
might be

1064
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:06,000
um a threat actor group that's been

1065
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,400
associated with some of the more recent

1066
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,280
ransomware attacks against technology

1067
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,200
those um

1068
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,040
those comments go right into an inbox

1069
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,119
where you can directly link back to

1070
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,200
where you're where you're being messaged

1071
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,680
from so the platform's designed for

1072
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,160
people that are newcomers to cyber to

1073
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,560
get access to this kind of live

1074
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,720
real world live data

1075
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,680
all of these links here are live i can

1076
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,680
show you how fresh they are

1077
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,440
over here we might even see some new

1078
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,040
links that have come in

1079
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,960
since um

1080
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,960
since this morning and

1081
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,640
absolutely in fact

1082
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,040
uh here's a new link from russia

1083
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,079
that was submitted four minutes ago

1084
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,200
um

1085
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,839
uh here's a new link from

1086
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,839
uh that looks pretty benign

1087
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,920
but some of these links might very well

1088
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,040
be

1089
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,079
uh you know other attacks that are being

1090
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,160
formed this these links came directly

1091
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,839
out of fish cloud

1092
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:06,640
um

1093
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,520
and that's how it works so an analyst

1094
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,400
that's working in this data can see real

1095
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,960
data while it's live while it's trying

1096
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,920
to

1097
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,640
maliciously infect a host

1098
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,640
and and investigate that when they

1099
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,520
investigate it they get they get payoffs

1100
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,480
for it

1101
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,960
they get in the form of points

1102
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,599
they generate those reports as i showed

1103
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,400
you putting those notes together

1104
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,040
and they basically conduct an analysis

1105
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,599
like a securities operations analyst

1106
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,560
would

1107
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,319
and then they get to collaborate with

1108
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:41,200
others

1109
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,920
that that have uh that are in the system

1110
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,480
too experts or a coach

1111
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,160
when their work is done

1112
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,000
they ask their manager

1113
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,359
to um to judge their their work by

1114
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:56,000
selecting a a box which

1115
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,560
sends directly their last work over to

1116
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,280
their manager for scoring

1117
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,079
um

1118
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:04,400
so i'm gonna go i'm gonna

1119
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,800
drop out of this and go back to the

1120
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,640
presentation and we'll wrap it up i

1121
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,720
think we've just got a few minutes left

1122
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,240
i don't know if anybody will have any

1123
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,920
questions but

1124
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,680
let's um

1125
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,440
let's see if we can

1126
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,480
return to the sharing screen

1127
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,480
and

1128
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,400
i think we're good

1129
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,720
no questions at the moment

1130
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,279
no questions

1131
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,640
let me uh

1132
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,960
so i guess last

1133
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,839
parting thoughts

1134
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,400
so this the experience you saw today was

1135
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,480
real it wasn't

1136
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,440
and it was happening in real time that

1137
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,520
link that ted looked at

1138
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,480
was

1139
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,359
introduced just yesterday to a global

1140
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:54,000
threat hunting community so our analysts

1141
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,119
get to

1142
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,240
ingest that coaches get to collect those

1143
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,640
links and bring them up into a

1144
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,760
follower group that they're teaching um

1145
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,800
and these

1146
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,400
newcomer analysts can prove their skills

1147
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,599
to employers like another one in our

1148
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:13,760
cohort did who's working for a company

1149
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,040
in chicago now a week after he got

1150
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,920
that job he was already using the skills

1151
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,480
he learned in the platform to analyze

1152
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,000
suspicious links

1153
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,560
so from here where we're going next is

1154
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,160
we're adding in new

1155
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,079
data sources to go directly out of

1156
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:33,280
endpoint data from companies that might

1157
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,520
want to host their interns in the

1158
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,200
platform and put them through their

1159
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,280
paces on their own actual event data um

1160
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,160
so

1161
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,319
we'd love to entertain any questions you

1162
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,319
might have or if any of this one wasn't

1163
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,800
clear clarify those points before we but

1164
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,280
we do have one question here and i

1165
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,960
um i'll comment to the audience the

1166
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,440
reporting will be up in about a week

1167
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,240
um

1168
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,839
on our youtube channel corncon

1169
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:02,160
tv there's mark's email and information

1170
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,839
i'll be reaching out to all the speakers

1171
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:04,640
to

1172
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,040
get presentations that we can link

1173
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,280
along with the video because sometimes

1174
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,839
the uh i think the zoom video is pretty

1175
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,760
good but sometimes it's nice to have the

1176
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,440
presentation as well do you have a

1177
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,680
question

1178
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,839
oh yes i'm not sure if you answered this

1179
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:21,920
but how would young people

1180
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,160
approach your company to

1181
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,079
get involved or

1182
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:27,440
someone like myself was mentoring

1183
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,480
someone

1184
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,440
do you

1185
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,359
find applicants or

1186
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,280
do they approach you

1187
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,520
right now that's a great question if you

1188
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,000
want to take my email down and email me

1189
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,160
we can start working with you or others

1190
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,359
in the region

1191
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,040
about creating

1192
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,200
the current way we're doing this is

1193
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,200
through cohorts typically

1194
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,359
we partner with a college like a

1195
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:52,000
community college or a workforce board

1196
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,560
and they help us recruit in the region

1197
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,240
people that might have been through a

1198
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,040
certification course or it's a company

1199
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,040
that's wanting to start developing the

1200
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,400
local talent

1201
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,000
either way we

1202
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,760
we then bring them in

1203
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,800
um

1204
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,480
you know get them

1205
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,560
get them the extra training they may

1206
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,400
need in order to be do the kind of

1207
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,640
analysis ted walked you through get them

1208
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,640
in a cohort with a coach

1209
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,280
um and then they can do this virtually

1210
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,720
we've been asked to do this for high

1211
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,200
schoolers so we're doing um a version of

1212
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,680
this for high schoolers probably with a

1213
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,440
partner that's going to allow for a

1214
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,880
virtual range

1215
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,359
uh portable virtual range to be hosted

1216
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:35,200
in in the schools so it's it's coming

1217
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,920
into the market right now um we'd love

1218
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,800
to talk with you about how that works

1219
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,920
um

1220
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,160
and depending on what you might have in

1221
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,359
mind um

1222
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,359
a community college network that wants

1223
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:49,359
to let us use their

1224
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:50,880

1225
