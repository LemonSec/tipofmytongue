and i should mention i think i'm

38
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,280
supposed to mention at the end we'll do

39
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,960
a little book signing out in the hallway

40
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,799
there so you can get a copy of my book a

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,799
complimentary copy there thanks to a

42
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,720
horncon i really appreciate that having

43
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,720
me come out here i know it's a smaller

44
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,479
crowd but that's okay if you do have any

45
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,680
questions

46
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,759
while i'm talking just feel free to just

47
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,520
put your hand up there and i'm happy to

48
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,079
try to answer the best of my can or get

49
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,759
to the answers later on so that way it

50
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,200
can be a little bit interactive

51
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,439
especially as a smaller group there now

52
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,119
and today what i'm going to be trying to

53
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,439
talk about is skimmers

54
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,920
and it's kind of a problem in the world

55
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,479
of cyber security that not that many

56
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,480
people talk about in fact a few years

57
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,360
ago

58
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,920
as i started to learn about skimmers and

59
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,520
the more and more

60
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,120
i heard about them and i started doing

61
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,120
research about them writing about them

62
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,120
and understanding

63
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,760
how effective they are it opened my eyes

64
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,200
up to a lot of different things and i

65
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,360
think that's kind of a

66
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,280
an interesting starting point just think

67
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,879
about cyber security in general

68
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,760
how much damages that there actually are

69
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,760
and certainly skimmers at the top at the

70
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,959
top we're going to talk about a little

71
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,599
bit here how much that makes up

72
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,239
in damages and credit card fraud things

73
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,280
each and every year it's amazing so just

74
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,280
to to kind of set the stage

75
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,720
[Music]

76
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,480
jump there just to the first slide i

77
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,000
just want you to think about this let's

78
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,640
just really put it in perspective

79
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,879
cyber crime damages will cost the world

80
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,400
six trillion dollars by 2021.

81
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,319
that's a lot of money

82
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,200
here we are in 2021. i had the privilege

83
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,560
here some of you guys

84
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,080
may watch the show shark tank or

85
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,879
whatever robert herzog um

86
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,519
he's got a really cool company worship

87
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,720
group up in toronto i was up there for a

88
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,400
particular event but this was another

89
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,000
occasion i got to sit down and interview

90
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,080
him for about a half hour and just ask

91
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,599
him some different

92
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,519
questions and get his pulse on the

93
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,519
industry of

94
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,720
and they do a couple hundred million

95
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,959
dollars a year so they're heavily

96
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,720
invested especially with a lot of the

97
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,319
stuff with the sony breach and other

98
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,400
breaches where they're very uh

99
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,640
instrumental and when i brought up this

100
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,319
statistic i asked them the question

101
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,360
about the

102
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,920
the damage of cyber security

103
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,360
and he thought that number was actually

104
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,680
conservative and was much worse

105
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,640
so again it speaks to how bad of a cyber

106
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,640
security problem there actually is out

107
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,799
there with all these compromises

108
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,120
and that kind of sets the stage thinking

109
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,519
about skimmers

110
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,239
skimmers are multi-billion dollar

111
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,120
industry stealing our credit cards

112
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,799
commonly from any type of retail

113
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,640
point-of-sale terminal

114
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,560
in the united states gas pumps are

115
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,839
targeted hugely and of course atms

116
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,600
so pretty much any bank and we're not

117
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,440
just talking united states but really

118
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,280
globally they're very effective and

119
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,120
there's different types of skimmers

120
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,960
and i'll talk about some of the

121
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,320
different things and show you a couple

122
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,440
different pictures from some of the

123
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,520
research i've done and some of the tools

124
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,040
that we've actually developed in our

125
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,919
company and just as a short background

126
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,919
more on the technical side

127
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,320
who am i what am i i'm just here

128
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,240
speaking about the problems and things

129
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,560
we're actually we have a company i run

130
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,720
and we develop wireless threat detection

131
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,520
tools so we do research we find problems

132
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,960
in the industry we actually provide

133
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,120
solutions most of our solutions are

134
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,600
hardware some software but most hardware

135
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,759
that we provide to dod agencies in this

136
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,080
particular case for skimmers we actually

137
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,960
develop skimmer detection tools so we

138
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,199
have to actually understand how skimmers

139
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,280
work how to find them and how to get

140
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,520
them out of whatever they're placed in

141
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,000
i'm also part of the skimmer task force

142
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
on national waste adventure so i work

143
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,240
with them sharing knowledge training

144
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,840
from different groups everything from

145
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,400
fbi secret service and local law

146
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,160
enforcement as well so i had to go out

147
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,400
make sure i'm trained understand how to

148
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,080
visually spot

149
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,240
skimmers how they're hidden inside of

150
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,479
gas pumps for example spent a day down

151
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,160
in florida learned a lot and then taught

152
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,080
a lot as well as a result just to give

153
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,360
you a little bit of context and

154
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,639
background which i think is always

155
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,800
important there

156
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,840
now

157
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,080
just to kind of high level what are some

158
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,160
things that we'll talk about here what

159
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,759
are skimmers the types of skimmers the

160
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,160
different methodology installing them

161
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,800
effectively how psycho criminals do this

162
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,400
how are some things practical things

163
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,160
that we can do to stay safe and then

164
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,919
also talk a little bit about dark web

165
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,360
i'll get into that i won't dive into any

166
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,199
of this real deep and technical unless

167
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,120
you have a question or want to oh i

168
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,039
could try but dark web more from a

169
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,479
standpoint of

170
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,560
how is this information that's stolen

171
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,639
actually sold because that's where most

172
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,479
of the stuff is going on is in the dark

173
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,160
web there so we'll dive into that a

174
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,919
little bit as well and again as a

175
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,039
reminder

176
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,720
just put your hand up there and yell out

177
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,319
if you have a question it makes for a

178
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,400
more lively discussion otherwise

179
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,080
i'm just going to be talking up here for

180
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,560
now trying to keep you guys all awake

181
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,919
okay so first of all what are skimmers

182
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,160
well skimmers are have been around for a

183
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,240
number of years ever since credit cards

184
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,240
really took place so they've been around

185
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,319
for decades we've heard about them and

186
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,000
then it kind of got quiet for a while we

187
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,600
didn't hear about them as much most of

188
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,680
the time when you hear about a skimmer

189
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,120
in the past it was always something that

190
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,880
would slide down the throat where your

191
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,720
credit card goes in we're used to that

192
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,360
right and what is a skimmer a skimmer is

193
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,240
basically a second magnetic head

194
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,240
a secondary read head that reads our

195
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,000
credit card information so that magnetic

196
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,080
stripe on the back of your credit card

197
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,919
that second re-head it pulls off the

198
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,919
track on track two cpu all that

199
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,199
information

200
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,639
that tells them hey here's the credit

201
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,039
card number and so on and so forth and

202
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,199
that mag stripe information is what

203
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,120
cyber criminals really are trying to get

204
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,639
they're trying to basically steal that

205
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,319
off of our cards there

206
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,520
as things evolved the wonderful world of

207
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,240
wireless things are more convenient now

208
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,880
we now hear about bluetooth skimmers and

209
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,280
then there's also cellular skimmers so

210
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,360
basically these are wireless skimmers

211
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,080
and again it's a magnetic read head and

212
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,000
then it's coupled to a wireless module

213
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,479
typically bluetooth is the most popular

214
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,759
because it's it's ism band 2.4 gigahertz

215
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,080
fast frequency hopping a level of

216
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,479
security there and it also allows the uh

217
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,800
the cyber criminal to have convenience

218
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,919
think about that for a moment if you're

219
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,160
a bad guy

220
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,919
and you go into a bank what do you do

221
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,879
you got maybe your mask on you got a gun

222
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,039
your getaway car outside you have all

223
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,039
these different things that you have

224
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,960
that could kind of give away

225
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,199
who you are and get caught now think

226
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,120
about it in contrast let's think about a

227
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,440
bluetooth skimmer that you place

228
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,000
let's say inside of a gas pump how would

229
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
one go about doing such well obviously

230
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,639
you got to buy the bluetooth skimmer

231
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,000
you just need some money for that

232
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,599
anywhere from i've seen them six hundred

233
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,479
dollars to maybe twelve hundred dollars

234
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,039
in the dark web actual cost in parts is

235
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,520
probably about thirty forty dollars but

236
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,039
they command a high price because they

237
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,479
know a lot of these guys have stolen

238
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,440
funds

239
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,520
and then they can easily buy a lot of

240
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,440
these skimmers it becomes a business

241
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,360
model in supply and demand

242
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,760
so they've used a couple common modules

243
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,839
typically these bluetooth modules inside

244
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,519
the bluetooth skimmer and how does it

245
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,679
work it's usually a simple microchip

246
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,920
that's got buffers of memory in it it's

247
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,240
got a bluetooth module in there that can

248
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,240
now transmit the information and there's

249
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,080
a cable that you can see it in this

250
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,240
picture here uh to the right of my

251
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,519
picture there when you plug that into

252
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,200
the top of the point-of-sale terminal so

253
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
your card would normally go in say it in

254
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,440
the gas pump all right your magnetic

255
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,760
card will go in there that cable plugs

256
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,360
on top so now the transaction will

257
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,920
happen you pull up to the gas station

258
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,839
and normally you would buy gas and pay

259
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,000
50 for gas the transaction will go

260
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,160
through but a copy of that information

261
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,680
with distorted credit card information

262
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,519
off your max tray would go into this

263
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,720
buffer

264
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,480
and now it just stores it it records a

265
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,000
couple hundred of these stolen credit

266
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,800
cards each day on each pump

267
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,279
and then what happens the cyber criminal

268
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,720
obviously wants to have it placed in the

269
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,080
machine they never have to go back to

270
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,440
the crime

271
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,600
scene right there to get caught they

272
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,519
could stay within about 75 foot

273
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,200
proximities about what you'll get out of

274
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,360
a typical good well-placed bluetooth

275
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,440
module and a gas pump

276
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,760
so we kind of get a sense of how easy it

277
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,839
is they'll pull up a parking lot

278
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,360
alongside the gas station with their

279
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,560
laptop

280
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,560
and then they'll pair they'll sync up

281
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,480
with that bluetooth module

282
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,080
and then they'll just download from each

283
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,440
machine each gas pump all those stolen

284
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,959
credit cards

285
00:09:58,959 --> 00:09:59,760
and then

286
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,160
later on use those to process online

287
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,680
cell packaging talk a little bit more

288
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,920
about that but that's the beauty but see

289
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,360
how convenient it is now you probably

290
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,519
are sitting there and saying oh well gas

291
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,360
pumps are locked aren't they

292
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,040
sure that's what i thought too

293
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,279
how many keys do you think they are

294
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,360
there are for gas pumps to get into it

295
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,760
this is about 90 of the million plus gas

296
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,320
pumps throughout the united states

297
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,240
you're pretty close five six six keys

298
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,600
generic keys

299
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,040
isn't that scary

300
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,040
so you got six keys that you can get

301
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,440
into all these pumps now does that make

302
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,200
any sense it actually does from a

303
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,959
convenience stand

304
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,279
so if you're a guest station attendant

305
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,880
you're the owner you're the guy

306
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,200
delivering the petroleum uh if your

307
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,480
national weights and measures you have

308
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,320
to come in and actually verify the

309
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,839
amount of

310
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,200
there's a lot of reasons that people

311
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,880
need constant access they've got to

312
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,720
change the paper that's printed out for

313
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,320
the credit card receipt and all of

314
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
that's good and fine and legal the

315
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,200
problem is the cyber criminals realize

316
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,279
i can get inside the rat's nest there

317
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,440
just simply plays a bluetooth skimmer so

318
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,399
you go on ebay or dark web now you buy

319
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,279
these six generic keys about fifteen to

320
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,839
twenty dollars that's even sold for

321
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,200
you're in business

322
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,920
now you pull up say two a.m at night at

323
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,000
the gas station no one's looking the

324
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,440
cameras are off

325
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,320
open up the door you take your bluetooth

326
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,160
skimmer that you purchased you plug it

327
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,920
in the top you close the door you lock

328
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,800
it

329
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,760
you leave

330
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,680
they provide power within the pump for

331
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,200
you you're in business

332
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,680
about 15 to 20 seconds the average cyber

333
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,760
criminal could put a bluetooth skimmer

334
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,720
upon

335
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,040
and a lot of the distinct operations law

336
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,640
enforcement that i've talked to and work

337
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,200
with the interesting thing is as fast as

338
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,920
they find the bluetooth scanners

339
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,720
take them out report them investigation

340
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,920
federal investigation a lot of work a

341
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,360
lot of money law enforcement does a

342
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,600
great job there however the next day

343
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,200
they'll be replaced again

344
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,120
it's that easy to put them in so you see

345
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,399
the common problem

346
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,240
i said to myself well this is stupid why

347
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,000
don't you change the locks

348
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,200
change the locks and you gotta have

349
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,639
different keys everybody doesn't have

350
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,800
access to the keys and it becomes that

351
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,040
locking key situation so it becomes more

352
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,600
of a physical security problem and many

353
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,000
people back away and hesitate from just

354
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,480
simply switching over to doing that so

355
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,880
and hence it makes make sense then

356
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,279
why the problem is so prevalent

357
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,360
now there's a lot of different types of

358
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,279
skimmers too the old days you see the

359
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,519
little kind of the green plastic that's

360
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,760
somewhat translucent it's outside of an

361
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,839
atm it's very common a lot of times

362
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,760
you'll actually take a skimmer and place

363
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,440
it

364
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,200
inside there and these things are pretty

365
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,639
smart you've brought one with me so you

366
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,320
can see it but it's something that'll

367
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,399
fit you know between my two fingers here

368
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,560
very small a couple inches across

369
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,160
small lithium battery there that's

370
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,839
typically on there they use a lot of hot

371
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,800
glue to affix them to different surfaces

372
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,120
um and then typically they'll actually

373
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,000
print with the 3d printer which is

374
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,360
anybody could use that these days

375
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,200
they'll actually print their own bezels

376
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,800
they'll try to make them look a little

377
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,120
bit warm they'll epoxy them on top of an

378
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,360
older vessel and that's more old-school

379
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,600
to do on an atm that could be done on a

380
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,839
gas pump i've seen it that way and again

381
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,839
they'll embed that circuit there

382
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,839
it could be a traditional skimmer or it

383
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,440
could be a bluetooth skimmer as well

384
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,680
there doesn't really matter

385
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,480
now for atms the interesting part is if

386
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,920
you think about it if you're using a

387
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,720
debit card obviously on your mac stripe

388
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,880
is is your credit card data your debit

389
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,720
card data that they want to steal they

390
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,560
need one other magical ingredient what

391
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,760
is that

392
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,079
your pen your pin right so how do they

393
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,240
accomplish that there they have to use a

394
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,040
small little pinhole camera and there

395
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,320
it's interesting because they'll place

396
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,320
it in any spot that you really can't see

397
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
and oftentimes if you look at the way an

398
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,120
atm is designed to see where the pinhole

399
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,560
cameras are you have to really be a

400
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,880
detective you have to get down

401
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,959
and look up underneath some of the spots

402
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,560
at the angles wherever you see a little

403
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,880
crack or crevice that's a great spot

404
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,639
where they tend to hide them and

405
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,880
sometimes they're actually again behind

406
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,120
other fake bezels i've seen them behind

407
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,800
stickers where they just put a little

408
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,399
pinhole over the camera so they can do a

409
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,399
lot of things to hide these cameras

410
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,160
what's the point of the whole camera

411
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,079
again so they can see your pin code one

412
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,240
two three four that allows you to have

413
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,079
access to your debit card and take the

414
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,079
money out and all they have to do now is

415
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,000
correlate their little video

416
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,079
with that of the stolen debit card

417
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,240
information put those together your

418
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,079
credit card information and your pin

419
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,000
code now they can go in business the

420
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,320
difference is with the debit card

421
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,480
when they take the money what happens

422
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,839
they take it out of your account

423
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,440
immediately

424
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,880
so i always question people think about

425
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,120
a debit card there's advantages of a

426
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,959
debit card it's convenient

427
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,560
you go into any machine anywhere you get

428
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,240
money out maybe you pay about for two or

429
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,800
three or if i mean four or five dollars

430
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,040
sometimes for a fake

431
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,399
but you don't have the same liability

432
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,760
protection that you do with a

433
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,839
traditional credit card

434
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,680
in other words traditional credit cards

435
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,000
compromise what happens you call up your

436
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,199
issuing bank credit card company my car

437
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,720
was compromised

438
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,480
uh mr shover will shut it down we'll

439
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,920
send you a new card you'll get a few

440
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,240
days what's your liability as a consumer

441
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,440
anybody know

442
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,440
fifty dollars right and nine out of ten

443
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,360
times and i've had my card compromised

444
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,920
more than probably all of you combined

445
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,600
because i was targeted and hacked within

446
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,000
my my company and myself personally

447
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,079
another story i may talk about it later

448
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,360
um

449
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,040
the interesting thing is if you call the

450
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,360
bank and say hey i'm a loyal customer

451
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,480
come on

452
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,920
we'll wait we'll wait for fifty dollars

453
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,680
mr chauffeur and how about your debit

454
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,079
cards compromised

455
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,560
not the same thing again they took three

456
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,000
hundred dollars out of mr shover's

457
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,360
account and i had to go fight to get

458
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,120
that money back will i get it back

459
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,639
probably because the bank wants to work

460
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,560
with me who pays for all this

461
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,320
who pays for all this money that's

462
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,759
stolen

463
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,079
a lot of people don't realize this the

464
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,560
consumer we do yeah

465
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,720
about four percent of all of the

466
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,199
interest that's paid

467
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,959
for these people that run balances don't

468
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,240
pay their car all the time about four

469
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,759
percent of them

470
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,279
bazillions of dollars i don't even know

471
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,040
how much money that it's a lot of money

472
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,440
that was just to fight credit card fraud

473
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,680
to fill claims and things like that with

474
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,120
all these problems people can make so

475
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,360
you start to see how big this problem is

476
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,480
huge

477
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,240
billions upon billions of dollars when

478
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,800
there's an atm or let's just say a gas

479
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,680
pump that a skimmer has found

480
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,519
think about that for just a moment what

481
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,199
what harm does that cost obviously

482
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,120
consumer credit card

483
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,040
that goes in that pump each pump usually

484
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,480
they get about two to three hundred

485
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,560
cards a day by around us

486
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,079
so you've got that issue and then make

487
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,519
their skimmers in three or four of the

488
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,360
pumps and then you're talking a thousand

489
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,560
parts a day

490
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,639
once they find the skimmer they have to

491
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,480
shut the pump off

492
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,320
they call it local law enforcement

493
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,160
becomes a federal crime scene so now

494
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,920
federal

495
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,920
has to be investigated

496
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,920
time money

497
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,240
costs you start to see the problem

498
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,399
the average gas pump with a skimmer

499
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,119
placed in gets about 116 000

500
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,640
stolen

501
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,039
credit cards before they find it

502
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,640
on average

503
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,480
now multiply that by

504
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,240
they're reporting thousands and

505
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,319
thousands of skimmers being pulled out

506
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,919
of machines

507
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,640
in many different states florida

508
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,000
texas

509
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,839
certain states are really bad so you

510
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,760
start to get a sense of how bad this

511
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,240
problem really really is

512
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,640
and we just need to be cautious what can

513
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,120
you do as a consumer

514
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,679
if you're pumping gas let's say to stay

515
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,360
safe

516
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,240
getting your credit card scammed

517
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,360
please

518
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,880
visual check

519
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,559
you can do a visual check excellent yeah

520
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,080
and that makes a lot of sense so you've

521
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,679
got an outside plastic bezel you can

522
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,039
jiggle it

523
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,640
and see if somebody tampered with the

524
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,799
machine something doesn't look right

525
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:55,679
um

526
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,000
now let's say it looks beautiful it's

527
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,520
not tampered with it looks like a brand

528
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,840
new machine

529
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,919
guess what maybe there's a bluetooth

530
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,400
scaler inside so no matter how good your

531
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,000
eyes are how would you check that

532
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,080
machine now guess what you may not see

533
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,080
it that's scary

534
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,400
that's really scary um and we even

535
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,919
developed some tools that actually go

536
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,600
down into the neck

537
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,919
of the actual credit card to see if we

538
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,360
detect if there's a second greenhead

539
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,799
basically it's real simple so it's a

540
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,160
green light red light a few hundred

541
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,240
dollars to stick it in there it beeps if

542
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,840
there's a skimmer placed in there if

543
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,919
it's clean it gives you green light now

544
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,160
that's good if it's an old style

545
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,000
traditional skimmer what if it's a

546
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,640
bluetooth uh skimmer in there well there

547
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,520
it's a little different we have a

548
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,720
different tool attached to the

549
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,039
directional antenna we had to design

550
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,200
conical directional antenna nine dbi

551
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,960
gain allows us to steer that people

552
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,880
think about a geiger counter so that

553
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,360
could steer inside to which gas pump and

554
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,600
we actually will pair with the actual

555
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,200
bluetooth module we'll establish a

556
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,840
connection pair with it and we talk to

557
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,760
it and then we can have it so just that

558
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,919
bluetooth module hangs out and talks to

559
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,919
us and what we've done simply is

560
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,280
identified

561
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,360
based upon an address inside each

562
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,600
bluetooth module which the cyber

563
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,320
criminal gangs are mostly using because

564
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,320
they're cheap they mass produce these

565
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,840
things they're built in china and these

566
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,679
these bluetooth skimmers so they're easy

567
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,360
to identify we've got about six of them

568
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,679
that have been identified in the wild so

569
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,120
we'll actually scan and look for those

570
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,120
specific addresses

571
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,120
and if we see that put the unit into a

572
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,039
special direction finding mode and

573
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,080
actually

574
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,600
hone in on it and now you walk up and

575
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,480
say that pump has a bluetooth skipper

576
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,480
pull it out next that one does those are

577
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,559
clean move on to the next station

578
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,960
it's that much of an effort to actually

579
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,640
have these task force work with law

580
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,880
enforcement to actually check and read

581
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,640
these things every day what's another

582
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,320
thing you could do so you don't become

583
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,760
victim

584
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,200
you probably don't have a tool to scan

585
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,320
the machine right if you're a consumer

586
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,000
what can you do

587
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,880
cash cash cash is king right old school

588
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,320
that's what i do

589
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,760
because there's no easy way as a

590
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,039
consumer pull up and know that there's

591
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,480
not a bluetooth skipper

592
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,400
no matter how good you are

593
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,960
it's a numbers game yeah statistically

594
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,400
you take the pump in the center that's

595
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,919
closest to the attendant has the lowest

596
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,840
number of skippers put in the one that's

597
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,520
closest to light and cameras you can use

598
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,600
some common sense

599
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,400
to minimize your chance and analyze the

600
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,640
risk so you don't get busted but if you

601
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,600
pull out

602
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,200
cash it's a lot safer it's not

603
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,400
convenient

604
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,559
i always talk about when i present to

605
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,520
different audiences balancing

606
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,440
security versus convenience and that's

607
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,200
really a decision in the world of cyber

608
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,080
security every day we have to make

609
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,600
do we want to take a moment extra and

610
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,240
use multi-factor authentication

611
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,880
well it's really it's a lot more secure

612
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,400
oh it's going to take an extra 30

613
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,000
seconds to look up that passcode and

614
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,320
enter in so what do we tend to do it's

615
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,600
not convenient so we shy away from it we

616
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,320
shy away from encryption we shy away

617
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,799
from backing up our data lots of these

618
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,039
things we tend to do

619
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,200
because it's convenient for us

620
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
so the balance is we hope that more and

621
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,400
more within the industry they can

622
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,679
develop products that are more

623
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,159
convenient and secure please go ahead

624
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,440
are there uh

625
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,840
contactless skimmers yet

626
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,840
that's a good question in fact

627
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,400
that bothered me for a while because and

628
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,880
i'm going to a long discussion going all

629
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,120
the way back about credit cards and

630
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,640
security

631
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,480
and maybe just briefly touch on it but

632
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,159
really to answer your point no there's

633
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,320
not a lot there's very little part of

634
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,440
the problem

635
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,039
and i don't want to get into the world

636
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,880
of politics and red tape but

637
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,039
if there's not a federal law there's not

638
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,320
a mandate

639
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,400
to put security into things it doesn't

640
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,320
typically happen because there's a cost

641
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,240
involved so in other words if you had to

642
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,080
take the million plus gas pumps out

643
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,400
there and upgrade them to more secure

644
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,880
payment methods it ain't going to happen

645
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,559
and if it does when there's a mandate

646
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,240
it's going to take years to happen i

647
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,280
believe it was last october the mandate

648
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,799
took effect where they're saying now

649
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,480
station's got to start

650
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,200
updating to put in more secure payment

651
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,120
and when i say more secure payment what

652
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,640
does that usually mean typically it

653
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,200
means chip and pen so let's back up for

654
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,320
a second here who here has chip and pin

655
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,280
and they're waller cars be honest i do

656
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,360
right probably all of us

657
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,840
who here when they go to the store

658
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,520
i don't know what your store is here

659
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,679
while quick check or whatever you do you

660
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:24,880
take your card and put it in the front

661
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,200
of the machine right you'll put it in

662
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,000
the front of the machine not

663
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,720
perpendicular so it can read the chip

664
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,520
and then who's entering a pen

665
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,120
oh wait a second you just said go on

666
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,000
chip and pin cards

667
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,559
do you really have chip and pin cards

668
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,720
yeah chip and pin cards but you're not

669
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,880
entering a pen

670
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,120
right we talk about security is achieved

671
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,360
in layers like we do multi-factor

672
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,200
authentication two-factor authentication

673
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,840
additional layer of security very

674
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,679
important yet you all have chip and pin

675
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,280
cards but you're not in your companion

676
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,120
what are you really using

677
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,360
chip and signature that's really what

678
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,200
you're implementing chip and signature

679
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,200
in other words i could take my chip and

680
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,360
pin card or my instrument bank sticking

681
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,679
it to any point of sale terminal and now

682
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,600
i can sign mickey mouse and they

683
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,360
validate me up on mickey mouse and the

684
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,280
transaction goes through does that seem

685
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,360
very secure to you

686
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,159
it's not please come here so um i lived

687
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,159
in the uk for a while and they did have

688
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,799
a chip and pit yes what was the what is

689
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,400
the difference because you know the

690
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,880
technology exists within the pos systems

691
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,080
that we're using

692
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,320
what's the reason that we're not using

693
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,400
the pin along with the gym a great

694
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,200
question uh it comes down unfortunately

695
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,200
to the old laney dollar

696
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,960
and in the case of what you mentioned

697
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,360
the united states is decades behind in

698
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,840
security i hate to say that living here

699
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,159
but it's true if you go to the uk you go

700
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,679
to canada you go to many countries

701
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,400
around the globe they implement security

702
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,320
along with credit cards much better

703
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,080
ironically who has the best liability

704
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,720
for credit card fraud in the united

705
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,080
states

706
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,320
so if you're compromising the uk when

707
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,600
you were over there

708
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,679
it's hard to get your money back in the

709
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,279
u.s it's really easy because the us

710
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,640
wants you to spend your money on credit

711
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,559
card and pay

712
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,080
interest rates and so on and so forth so

713
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,480
the system is backwards it's throw money

714
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,919
at the wrong thing so instead of

715
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,600
spending money and implementing security

716
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,120
properly

717
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,640
it's done backwards now let's take a

718
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,520
step back let's go back 2013.

719
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,039
do you guys remember when the headlines

720
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,760
all went crazy target breach

721
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,120
right

722
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,279
credit card i remember that day very

723
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,880
well that night i was sitting there with

724
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,559
my wife who happens to love targeting

725
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,240
shops there every week

726
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,520
i said oh great we're gonna be

727
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,559
compromised sure enough we were um

728
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,320
the next morning i got a phone call i

729
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,240
don't know what it started i think at 4

730
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,799
am i had five interviews that day i'm

731
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,320
close to new york city so i have to go

732
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,679
in and off and weigh in on different

733
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,919
breaches that's when it really kicked in

734
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,240
five different major news networks i had

735
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,640
to hit all in one day or cnn bloomberg

736
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,120
fox down the whole channel i was like

737
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,880
what happened how did this happen what

738
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,120
we've done is that the one thing nobody

739
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,799
really wanted to hear nobody really does

740
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,000
today

741
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,400
but i'll say it anyway back in 2013 a

742
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,919
little prior to that

743
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,440
when the whole target breach started to

744
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,000
unfold 2014 and 15 we learned about all

745
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,080
the details of it target actually was

746
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,480
the first to adopt chip and pin

747
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,000
technology

748
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,720
they actually went did a pilot and spent

749
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,320
tons of money

750
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,640
testing proof guess what it works it's

751
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,120
more secure the negative side to your

752
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,159
point

753
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,880
it slowed people down at the register

754
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,000
it wasn't as fast so now again

755
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,640
convenience or security what do you want

756
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,640
to choose

757
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,080
money man convenience that's what

758
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,520
happened unfortunately they abandoned

759
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,360
the whole project so they they quickly

760
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,360
disbanded wasted a lot of money in doing

761
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,120
all the r d research to prove that it

762
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,720
actually works but they went for the

763
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,640
money did they pay for it i think so

764
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,799
brand damage right just alone we're

765
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,960
still talking about it today years later

766
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,960
so it helps to put things in perspective

767
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,240
the importance of

768
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,480
if you have a small business

769
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,880
to apply security within reason it can

770
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,640
make a difference between your survival

771
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,640
and your failure sometimes a lot of

772
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,400
people don't realize that but it really

773
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,240
does make sense

774
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,640
to properly deploy security and use it

775
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,880
now the mandate happened with

776
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,000
the laws

777
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,880
that

778
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,200
if all the retail

779
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,159
locations didn't update to new chip and

780
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,559
pin technology by a certain date this

781
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,159
again was an october something dated a

782
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,880
few years ago if it didn't happen then

783
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,480
there was a liability shifts and then

784
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,080
you've got a bank and issuing merchant

785
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,400
it basically goes down to the retailer

786
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,320
so if you don't update and there's a

787
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,320
breach or a problem you're held liable

788
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,600
then you're going to pass so guess what

789
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,720
happened

790
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,480
the spend happened and everybody

791
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,640
suddenly updated chip and pin so they

792
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,480
have the ability to accept it they just

793
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,240
don't implement that's all so it's kind

794
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,960
of a backwards conversation in some ways

795
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,880
please good

796
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,120
working in the industry i've heard a lot

797
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,799
of chat about

798
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,720
reputation damage reputation damage

799
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,320
reputation damage

800
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,279
i'm looking at target stock price

801
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,679
and they're at record high yeah so is

802
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,919
there really a long-term reputation

803
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,399
damage and therefore an actual monetary

804
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,799
cost to the companies yeah yeah there

805
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,480
actually is in fact i did an article

806
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,000
appeared in the huffington post a few

807
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,760
years ago and talked just about that um

808
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,000
specifically i got into detail if you do

809
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,840
a search on the internet you can find it

810
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,240
i talked about the brand damage what's

811
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,919
inflicted who are all the parties

812
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,279
involved

813
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,279
now in the case of a target the

814
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,120
interesting thing is they're a huge

815
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,039
brand that was growing growing broke so

816
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,200
put them out in the news a lot

817
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,200
but then what happens is over time

818
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,880
people tend to forget they get a little

819
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,480
complacent

820
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,600
and

821
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,279
where does the money often come from for

822
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,000
a large public company

823
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,440
it's the public

824
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,840
so again who's paying for it

825
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,399
people are buying shares of it right did

826
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,159
they take a head did they take a loss

827
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,919
that they they have a lot of problems

828
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,080
yeah clash class action laws and so on

829
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,159
and so forth cost them a lot of money in

830
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,679
the end though

831
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,279
did it tarnish their brand i think it

832
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,279
did for a couple years

833
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,640
i think they actually came out pretty

834
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,960
good let's contrast that that's a really

835
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,480
good point think about this you guys

836
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,640
remember it was two years later jp

837
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,919
morgan

838
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,919
when they were compromised now here you

839
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,360
are different sector we're talking

840
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,200
financial sector

841
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,120
and they were they suffered a terrible

842
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,120
data breach

843
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,159
the difference is in my opinion

844
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,159
they came clean right away because they

845
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,240
said we were breached we were

846
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,399
compromised here's what happened here's

847
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,159
how it happened here's what we're going

848
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,840
to do about it oh by the way we're going

849
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,039
to commend

850
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,520
500 million dollars to upgrade our

851
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,880
security

852
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,279
here's probably the most the strongest

853
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,799
bank from a security posture out there

854
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,480
and they said where breeds were

855
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,559
compromised here's what's happened we're

856
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,080
going to go out and spend over the next

857
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,279
couple of years

858
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,320
500 million dollars of security

859
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,559
was there brand tarnish i didn't think

860
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,399
that much

861
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,399
despite the rumors and stories breach

862
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:17,760
and compromise all that other stuff they

863
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,440
came out pretty good

864
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,960
so it does have different effects for

865
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,720
different companies and i think that's

866
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,360
important to realize and get a better

867
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,200
sense now since we're talking about

868
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,200
credit cards debit cards we're talking

869
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,960
about skimmers different ways to

870
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,399
compromise

871
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,799
what do you think is another method that

872
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,520
you can use as a consumer or business

873
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,640
owner

874
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,919
that you can still use your credit card

875
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,559
but safer

876
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,360
what do you use

877
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,399
what should you use keep a separate card

878
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,039
with a low balance you could it's a

879
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,480
hybrid you could do that keep a separate

880
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,000
car it's a good point some people do

881
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,799
that

882
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,559
limited amount you could also contact

883
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,200
your bank and say hey if a transaction

884
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,960
is ever above this i want to get a text

885
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,240
and i want to improve there's a lot of

886
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,760
things that kind of do

887
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,240
not as convenient but they work

888
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,000
what about this what does everybody have

889
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,120
on themselves right now

890
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,039
smartphone

891
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,640
digital payments

892
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,320
who here uses

893
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,440
google wallet or apple pay

894
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,600
wow okay so it looks like two or three

895
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,360
people out of this whole room and myself

896
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,480
included

897
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,960
why are we not using

898
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,799
that i talked to someone the other day

899
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,279
about it and said oh it's not secure

900
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,559
i said it isn't is that your credit

901
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:40,080
card's more secure yeah much more secure

902
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,320
i said oh that's surprising please

903
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,080
one of the problems out here in flyover

904
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,520
country is

905
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,159
out of all of the shops i go to

906
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,520
maybe 15 20 of them support

907
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,760
yeah yeah and that's it you hit nail on

908
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,880
the head that's part of the part of the

909
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,240
problem right there please go ahead well

910
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,240
and what's funny is

911
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,919
you will walk up to people and they do

912
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,480
not realize that they support it right

913
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,159
they don't do a good job of telling the

914
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,159
people that work there that their

915
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,760
machines their terminals actually

916
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,600
support it so there have been times

917
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,360
where i've used it and they didn't even

918
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,519
know it was supported yeah and that's a

919
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,200
brilliant point there lack of education

920
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,120
and understanding makes a really good

921
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,360
point there so educating people it

922
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,760
hasn't happened yet hasn't taken on

923
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,120
widespread adoption there's also a lot

924
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,440
of misnomers about it i hear all the

925
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,279
time and i say oh i use apple pay and

926
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,039
they say well you're not very smart and

927
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,279
said what do you mean well apple pay was

928
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,039
compromised

929
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,120
i said well not exactly

930
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,519
what was when it first was launched

931
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,080
people started adopting and using it

932
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,600
what happened was

933
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,320
the

934
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,480
cyber criminals caught on quickly and

935
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,519
they said oh okay so and basically i

936
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,720
don't know if you guys notice your mouse

937
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,919
do a high level deep dive how does apple

938
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,080
pay or google pay work

939
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,799
it simply is a digital transaction so

940
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,640
it's sending a one-time encrypted

941
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,720
tokenized

942
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,200
message let's say it's not sending your

943
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,880
credit card information

944
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,799
nothing associated to you so it's used

945
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,440
one time it's token it's encrypted

946
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,679
to simplify it's secure

947
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,320
so anywhere in the ecosystem it can't be

948
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,640
compromised no cyber fee to steal your

949
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,640
credit card does that make sense

950
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,159
so now

951
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,600
ask yourself where's the weak point of

952
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,039
that

953
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,600
issuing bank so cyber criminals said ah

954
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,080
i got an idea let's call the bank up and

955
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,159
i'll pretend i'm mr scott shower

956
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,000
and now i can simply say oh yeah i'm

957
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,440
signing up a

958
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,360
a credit card which happens to be stolen

959
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,600
credit card over here to my new iphone

960
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,679
that i just got oh okay mr sugar where

961
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,600
do you live and uh what's your social

962
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,120
security number great you're all set

963
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,320
you're

964
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,760
done

965
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,679
he said hey so they started doing that

966
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,240
easily so where was the weak point

967
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,320
over here the bank

968
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,159
that's the problem so now they have a

969
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,240
laundry list of more secure questions

970
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,919
and carefully before they just quickly

971
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,640
sign somebody up and but the headlines

972
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,240
said oh no

973
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,080
pays breach it's not secure so now the

974
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,480
stigma in the industry is insecure don't

975
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,200
use it you see the problem

976
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,240
please

977
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,039
is there a cross-platform

978
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,279
mobile payment system

979
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,600
that isn't run by an advertising company

980
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,720
is there a cross

981
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,039
platform so i can use it on my wife's

982
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,919
iphone and my android

983
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,039
no

984
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,640
no unfortunately so the only one that's

985
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,559
doing there's probably a bigger reason

986
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,559
yeah again not to get into tech but the

987
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:37,919
way it's handled in the world of android

988
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,519
versus apple let's just say different

989
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,600
ecosystems you've got end-to-end

990
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,360
encryption over there and android which

991
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,679
is secure this and that apple into an

992
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,360
encryption on a software level but they

993
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,440
also have a secure enclave which is

994
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,760
hardware that adds a layer of hardware

995
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,760
encryption in there too so it's kind of

996
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,760
like apples to oranges and it's not real

997
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,360
they don't play together real well so it

998
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,440
makes it difficult

999
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,120
for the world of security and credit

1000
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,640
card processing and things like that

1001
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,240
just to make but when you think about a

1002
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,559
credit card you process it there's a lot

1003
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,239
of stuff that goes on behind the scenes

1004
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,159
when you dig into it the fact that it

1005
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,239
works to me is amazing enough

1006
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,239
but the fact that it's so complex some

1007
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,879
of the things helps you see how cyber

1008
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,440
criminals can take advantage of that

1009
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,560
right

1010
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,000
so again when we get back to this

1011
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,159
concept of skimmers just to reflect upon

1012
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,679
that a moment again

1013
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,480
um

1014
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,719
if you think about it

1015
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,040
eventually we can get that mag stripe

1016
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,839
off of our credit cards and we could

1017
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:37,040
really use chip and pin or like the

1018
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,280
payment methods near field communication

1019
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,839
we bring our digital wallets

1020
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,679
toward the terminal do the near field

1021
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,000
communication short distance different

1022
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,040
frequency that's secure encrypted

1023
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,280
we can do some amazing things and still

1024
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,800
be secure and have convenience at a cost

1025
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,800
so it's kind of balancing all of that in

1026
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,240
i see it coming in the future it's

1027
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,119
exciting i don't think it's there yet

1028
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,520
a lot of people talk to me often i feel

1029
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,520
a lot of space also with cryptocurrency

1030
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,780
and that's the answer

1031
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,240
[Music]

1032
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,000
i'm not a firm believer in that yet that

1033
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,240
it's going to be coming that quick only

1034
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,839
because the sheer amount of stuff

1035
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,440
associated

1036
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,440
to cryptocurrency

1037
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,400
and cyber criminal gangs and

1038
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,680
the problems associated to it

1039
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,520
kind of a different subject a different

1040
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,280
problem there for sure

1041
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,480
[Music]

1042
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,160
just to show a couple more pictures and

1043
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,599
some of the stuff that i've been

1044
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,920
involved with looking at different types

1045
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,680
of skimmers here and

1046
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,359
i i always thought it was interesting

1047
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:38,880
when it went for training and really

1048
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,960
understanding and then got to to kind of

1049
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,119
cross train and teach others

1050
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,440
if you look to that far picture there

1051
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,760
inside of a gas pump do you start to

1052
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,160
understand why it's difficult

1053
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,800
to find a skimmer

1054
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,160
it's a rat's nest in a lot of these

1055
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,000
guest packs not all but some of them are

1056
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,839
almost

1057
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:59,359
impossible to be able to pinpoint it out

1058
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,200
in fact when i was in florida after a

1059
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,680
long hot day working with the task force

1060
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,119
and law enforcement we're going through

1061
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,040
a machine they're quickly going through

1062
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,359
them and i'm looking with interest

1063
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:10,640
because i kind of knew what i was

1064
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,440
looking for and toward the very end it

1065
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,880
was almost the last machine we were

1066
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,320
inspecting

1067
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,320
i said guys stop a second i said you

1068
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,079
missed something over here

1069
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,680
there's a skimmer in that machine like

1070
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,119
no no they went through it no i don't

1071
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,880
see how it happens three or four more

1072
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,040
guys came over and looked

1073
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,880
i said there's a skimmer in there sure

1074
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,040
enough moved some stuff

1075
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,640
secretly hidden i just quartered all the

1076
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,480
corners it's that hard to look at so

1077
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,599
here you've got people who are doing

1078
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,960
this every day

1079
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,400
going through know where to look at

1080
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,640
paddle blow and i found kind of a hybrid

1081
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,480
solution skimmer there

1082
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,920
just somebody that was going on training

1083
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,599
for the first day so it's that hard to

1084
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:46,720
identify

1085
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,800
so you really get the sense of how bad a

1086
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,680
problem is now oftentimes

1087
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,480
if we talk about atms slightly different

1088
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,920
i should just bring up this point as

1089
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,280
well just so you can kind of reflect

1090
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,520
upon it we talked about how easy it is

1091
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,680
to get into a gas pump

1092
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,720
right obvious reasons key

1093
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,040
atm is it easy to open up your local atm

1094
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,960
here in iowa no

1095
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,240
not as easy

1096
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,000
so a little bit different techniques are

1097
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,839
used now i should say this now i've got

1098
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:15,359
a whole bunch of atms when i was doing

1099
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,839
research on this and took them apart to

1100
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,359
understand and learn it the part that's

1101
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,800
kind of fascinating with an atm machine

1102
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,839
is the safe that holds the money

1103
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,680
the safe in there and this is pretty

1104
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,359
true all

1105
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,280
atm machines it takes you about three

1106
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,040
hours just to drill

1107
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,520
a small quarter inch hole with a good

1108
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,000
carbide bit three hours

1109
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,680
that's a good hammer for trying to get

1110
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,359
in there so you start dancing

1111
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,200
what did cyber criminals do they come up

1112
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,560
with the ultimate thing to get into the

1113
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,320
safe no

1114
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,800
but what's on top of an atm most atm

1115
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,440
machines you have the paper dispenser

1116
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,359
where the checks go in to the drawers

1117
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,680
and everything else what tends to be the

1118
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,359
weak point in an atm machine they always

1119
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,119
run out of the paper for the receipts

1120
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,640
and the top of the machine you can open

1121
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,440
up

1122
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,880
i thought it was funny when i bought all

1123
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,480
these different atm machines i didn't

1124
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,680
want to mix the keys up but i had a

1125
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,440
couple of the same brands

1126
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,040
and i tried a key on one and worked on

1127
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,680
another i said how could this be

1128
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,040
this is like the world of gas pumps

1129
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,359
again they have some generic keys for

1130
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,440
atm machines

1131
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,119
for the top of it now again it doesn't

1132
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,359
give you access to the safe

1133
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,200
but i didn't need access to the safe if

1134
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,440
i was cyber criminal i just needed to

1135
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,880
know where i could place my bluetooth

1136
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,880
skimmer oh there's there's a connector

1137
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,800
right there it's labeled in the power

1138
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,800
and everywhere

1139
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,960
you start to see the problem

1140
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,000
so

1141
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,400
it's much easier than i ever thought to

1142
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,320
get inside a typical atm machine and

1143
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,160
place a bluetooth skimmer a little bit

1144
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,079
different in that

1145
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,520
sometimes

1146
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,839
if you're at a bank it's bolted into the

1147
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,079
wall there's cameras there's lights

1148
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:51,920
those are harder to get into they're

1149
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,320
going to typically use a different type

1150
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,839
of skimmer where you go deep skin or

1151
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,839
maybe down the neck where your card goes

1152
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,599
in or super flat some of the pictures

1153
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:00,640
they showed

1154
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,480
or they're going to take a bezel and put

1155
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,160
it over the other bezel that type of

1156
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,640
skimmer there not a bluetooth skimmer

1157
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,400
but if they can open that top up just

1158
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,680
about every time they put a bluetooth

1159
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,800
skimmer in there because they never have

1160
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,359
to come back again and it works well so

1161
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,200
if you're using atms the ones you want

1162
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,960
to be cautious about say you're in a

1163
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,720
convention center like this and there's

1164
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,119
a small little kiosk atm machine in the

1165
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,839
corner and it's got maybe a generic key

1166
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,160
or an access door or means they can get

1167
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,400
in there i tell you what my

1168
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,480
my battery-powered sawzall works well

1169
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,359
too

1170
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:34,240
just go in the top pocket hole

1171
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,960
take it out put the bluetooth skimmer in

1172
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,720
and then i take a big giant sticker and

1173
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,320
right you know this machine is secure or

1174
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,920
something on the side whatever to cover

1175
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,079
the hole i mean so you see how easy it

1176
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,320
is to get into these things and actually

1177
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,560
place the hardware in there so we want

1178
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,880
to be very mindful again as consumers

1179
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,240
we're not going to be able to identify

1180
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,599
those things unless we do a full

1181
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,280
inspection we're not doing that we're

1182
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,800
trying to get quick twenty dollars to

1183
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,079
buy pizza

1184
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,200
so use caution for any type of kiosk

1185
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,280
skimmers if you're in the city

1186
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,800
gotta be careful

1187
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,760
funny story we're developing our tool

1188
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,040
for uh testing skimmers and atms we

1189
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,400
started we had a crew we gave them out

1190
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,160
to each employee we would go around to

1191
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,040
different

1192
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,200
uh etm's and test it to see if there

1193
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,800
were skimmers

1194
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,640
well about three weeks after we did all

1195
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,319
of our testing we improved the product

1196
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,280
so and so forth i get law enforcement

1197
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,599
shows up on our building

1198
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,000
and they say are you the owners yeah can

1199
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,520
we talk to you okay

1200
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,119
they take me aside and they've got a

1201
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,560
guy's like holding his gun here the

1202
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,839
other guy's here and the other guy's got

1203
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,200
handcuffs

1204
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,800
i said is there a problem they're like

1205
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,800
well we got this license plate we got

1206
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,119
these photos and they had a whole file

1207
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,720
from three weeks

1208
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,720
from all the banks that

1209
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,359
recorded us testing we weren't too smart

1210
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:50,800
we didn't call ahead i guess again

1211
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,480
permission to test we thought well we'll

1212
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,240
just go in test real quick to see if the

1213
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,920
skimmer move on all that's being

1214
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,000
recorded so it was kind of funny when

1215
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,680
they sat down with all the evidence and

1216
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,280
said what are you doing

1217
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,040
i said oh we're testing our product here

1218
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,640
to see if we're looking for skimmers

1219
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,400
that's pretty cool let me try it

1220
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,839
at fortune we didn't get arrested or

1221
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,160
anything else but it does tell you that

1222
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,400
atms have good security they have

1223
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,240
cameras and they work closely with law

1224
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,640
enforcement do do a good job but it is

1225
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,040
hard it's very hard to catch these bad

1226
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,040
guys because they know

1227
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,119
which machines to target and that's part

1228
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,640
of the problem eventually they could get

1229
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,200
caught up please go ahead so in terms of

1230
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,440
you know the process side and not just

1231
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,000
the technology side what are banks doing

1232
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,240
at this point to say like we are

1233
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,480
responsible for going to our atms every

1234
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,800
day and having an employee wiggle it a

1235
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,960
little bit just to see what happens or

1236
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,920
because

1237
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,440
there's other things they could do in

1238
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,079
terms of either monitoring or checking

1239
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,800
things

1240
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,400
that question you would assume they

1241
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,560
would do the best job they can test the

1242
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,200
machines every day so on and so forth

1243
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,359
i can't i can't say that isn't the case

1244
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,520
i can say for some banks i can't name

1245
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,680
them but some banks that we have our

1246
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,160
customers they will traditionally buy 20

1247
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,000
or 30 of our tools and then they'll have

1248
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,079
us actually train the employees and

1249
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,560
actually every morning and as the bank

1250
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,119
closes they actually test each atm

1251
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,800
to make sure there is no skimmers that

1252
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,560
were placed at any time or through the

1253
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,599
night

1254
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,000
and that's that's very common and a lot

1255
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,400
of us are trained we actually built even

1256
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,040
because it was so difficult to support

1257
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,880
and train different groups between law

1258
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,640
enforcement national weights and

1259
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,720
measures banks um we built a box that's

1260
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,960
got a skimmer built in so we built a

1261
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,800
skimmer into one side

1262
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,319
of a point-of-sale terminal and one

1263
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:39,440
that's green and one that's red

1264
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,440
basically so we hit it and we trained

1265
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,599
and we built an actual training box to

1266
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,160
teach people how to identify so they

1267
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,240
know what to visually look for but also

1268
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,520
they know how to actually test it with a

1269
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,280
simple little tool yeah

1270
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,520
it's a good point though i wish more

1271
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,040
people would do that if all the banks

1272
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,440
did what they probably should do i

1273
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,560
probably wouldn't be standing here and

1274
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,160
be on a beach somewhere retired right

1275
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,480
now but not enough money is spent there

1276
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,560
for security unfortunately and part of

1277
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,079
the reason they say well

1278
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:07,839
it's covered liability will cover

1279
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:09,920
consumers will cover it

1280
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,680
you know make those fees because that's

1281
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,520
what the atms do they're really a fee

1282
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,119
generated type of thing the other

1283
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,960
problem is i've learned

1284
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,119
many of the atms are now outsourced to a

1285
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,359
third party that actually maintains them

1286
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:22,720
loads the money

1287
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,040
provides the security and they may have

1288
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,800
it by us we have one customer and

1289
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,880
they've got about a thousand atms in new

1290
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,240
jersey new york

1291
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,000
and they say oh the banks are so cheap

1292
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,760
they won't spend a dime

1293
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,839
for us to just check for skimmers that

1294
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:37,440
maybe they pay us

1295
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,560
50 cents to a dollar a day i don't think

1296
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,000
that's all they would spend to get

1297
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,680
something that could potentially take

1298
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,760
thousands of dollars of consumers money

1299
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,560
out that's concerning but it helps again

1300
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,839
it is reality you have to look at

1301
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:52,880
reality but it's a great question

1302
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,839
unfortunately

1303
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,040
oh i can tell you a quick oh please guys

1304
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,720
um so you've been talking about the

1305
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,520
banks and their atms um

1306
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,319
has have you had any interest from

1307
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:09,520
shell citgo the the big gas companies

1308
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,640
um

1309
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,240
at least for their stations and

1310
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,720
having the ability to test those

1311
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,200
yeah absolutely in fact in fact we have

1312
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,960
um i can't mention who it is but we've

1313
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,720
had some that have

1314
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,800
thousands of stations

1315
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,680
uh approach us and more more of the

1316
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,440
it's ironic the companies that are tied

1317
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,599
with convenience store

1318
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:35,280
and and gas pumps why i kind of learn

1319
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,880
if somebody goes to the gas pump and

1320
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,400
they realize and trace it back that's

1321
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,560
where my card was compromised

1322
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,839
they don't go there to shop at the

1323
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:43,520
convenience store so it's a money issue

1324
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,960
again you follow money for all this you

1325
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,520
can find the answer unfortunately so

1326
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,160
they spend the money the larger brands

1327
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,400
you guys all know we all use them that

1328
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,400
have that combination gas pumps

1329
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,000
convenience store

1330
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,960
they will spend more money and buy tools

1331
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,280
and training and inspect and rid the

1332
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,720
skimmers quicker

1333
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,200
but remember again the goal is in other

1334
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,720
stations i've kind of come across too

1335
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,800
here's the irony of it one station

1336
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,079
we talked to

1337
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:10,800
and

1338
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,560
he was looking at skimmers all the time

1339
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,920
what do you do with them what do you

1340
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,960
know what i do with them i throw them in

1341
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,880
a box and back back and you've got 100

1342
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,400
of them in a box

1343
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,680
so how could you do that that's you

1344
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,440
can't do that you gotta report it i'm

1345
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,040
not gonna report that law enforcement

1346
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,400
will come in here and shut me down i

1347
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,480
can't make money

1348
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,440
do they care whose money they're taking

1349
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,960
it really doesn't matter that's part of

1350
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,440
the problem there's no incentive for a

1351
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,920
gas station owner an independent

1352
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,560
franchise to report this

1353
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,839
and then unfortunately when it is

1354
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:41,599
reported to law enforcement it costs

1355
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,240
money and time they're chasing after

1356
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,560
cyber criminals often organized it could

1357
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,800
be a russian cyber criminal gang they

1358
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,599
send over 100 people to place skimmers

1359
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:53,119
with maps and everything else is very

1360
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:54,880
well organized

1361
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,480
so do you want to spend money on that or

1362
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,240
do you want to have law enforcement stop

1363
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,640
bad guys that are killing people right

1364
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,839
it's tough there's only so much

1365
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:04,400
resources and money and time so it can

1366
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,160
be very frustrating let me tell you a

1367
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,440
funny story

1368
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,920
um this is a true story what's going on

1369
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,240
in one particular state especially but

1370
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,240
it's other states as well again highly

1371
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,720
organized cyber criminal gangs

1372
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,920
talk about gas pumps and skimmers

1373
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,319
the criminal comes up places skimmer

1374
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,960
bluetooth skimmer inside the gas pump

1375
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,560
starts collecting

1376
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,640
you know from his car within 75 foot

1377
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,599
proximity stolen cars goes back burns

1378
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,200
some fresh cards as they call you you

1379
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,960
can buy these i buy them a couple

1380
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,560
hundred at a time on the internet not

1381
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,920
that much money and they basically have

1382
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,160
a mag stripe and you can simply take

1383
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,640
that your stolen credit card burned onto

1384
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,720
this fresh blank credit card you're in

1385
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,520
business he takes that fresh credit card

1386
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,119
of one of our stolen credit cards

1387
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,720
because we went to that gas pump goes

1388
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,119
back to that same gas station

1389
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:54,880
this time he goes back with a large

1390
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,920
pickup truck with a 600 gallon bladder

1391
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,160
on the back of the pickup truck

1392
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,720
what does he do takes your my stolen

1393
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,599
credit card buys 600 gallons of stone

1394
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:07,280
usually it's diesel but it could be

1395
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,599
gasoline depends on the case

1396
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:10,960
fills it up

1397
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,800
it doesn't end there now he takes that

1398
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,240
stolen gas

1399
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,440
you know that it took him from our

1400
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,520
credit card goes around the corner he

1401
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,079
meets the tanker truck

1402
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:22,480
and pumps that 600 gallons of gas back

1403
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,400
into the tanker truck that then goes to

1404
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,559
that gas station and sells it back to

1405
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:27,920
that gas station

1406
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,319
you see what's happening

1407
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:32,160
now you start to think about gas at

1408
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,400
three four bucks a gallon

1409
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,040
600 gallons they're doing this day in

1410
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,599
day out day in and day out

1411
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:40,960
problem

1412
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,640
so when you when i talk to you in the

1413
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,960
beginning about 6 trillion in cyber

1414
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,920
security uh breaches and damages and

1415
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,599
then in that there's billions upon

1416
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,440
billions just because of skimmers that

1417
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,359
seem kind of far-fetched

1418
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:54,960
but when you see what's happening in the

1419
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,720
bigger picture

1420
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,640
billions and billions of dollars that's

1421
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,480
only what's reported

1422
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,800
so we start to see how big of a problem

1423
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,800
this really is that is concerning to me

1424
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,119
and more needs to certainly be done

1425
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,160
unfortunately not enough is done there

1426
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,920
i'll share one other thing that i

1427
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,440
learned in some of my research and

1428
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,359
talking with different individuals a lot

1429
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:20,240
of times we focus our attention so much

1430
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,359
in a particular area we miss the obvious

1431
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:24,640
what am i talking about look at that

1432
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,920
middle picture right at the arrow

1433
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,119
they're pointing

1434
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:28,559
so you're going to a bank did you ever

1435
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:32,000
go into those your bank is bank xyz

1436
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,720
atm's well-lit security cameras and you

1437
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,800
say this is secure i go to this one all

1438
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,760
the time

1439
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,800
and now to get in after hours oftentimes

1440
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,960
there's a glass vestibule to get in

1441
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,480
where do you stick your

1442
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,640
debit card in to get in right outside

1443
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,240
the door there's a little slot when you

1444
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,720
stick your card in here and it's a solid

1445
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,720
line that opens the door and locks it so

1446
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,640
they know okay it's a legitimate

1447
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,800
customer open the door you go in

1448
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,000
where do you think they put the scanner

1449
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,680
right there at the door

1450
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,960
why it's more convenient they don't have

1451
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,559
to get in there and get into the atm

1452
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,559
machine now guess what they just stole

1453
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,720
your debit card information before you

1454
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,640
even stepped foot in the back isn't that

1455
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,240
smart

1456
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,200
scary but nobody knows this

1457
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,920
nobody i've ever talked to realizes this

1458
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,680
yet it happens every single day

1459
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:25,839
please do you think that there is some

1460
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:28,079
sort of perverse incentive i guess you

1461
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:30,000
could say from the bank's perspective

1462
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,240
not to educate customers

1463
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,680
because i think there could be some

1464
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,839
really easy morning signals like watch

1465
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,920
out for skimmers or essentially people

1466
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,160
stick around an atm that goes hey

1467
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,839
be aware that they're not doing it

1468
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:43,839
because the consumer would receive the

1469
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:45,280
responsibility

1470
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,680
of skippers to be the bank to protect

1471
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,359
them and they don't want to run into

1472
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:50,160
that

1473
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,960
i think it's a great point

1474
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,520
i'll play devil's advocate i'll say for

1475
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,839
the gas pump industry they tried that

1476
00:49:57,839 --> 00:49:59,359
what they did was they actually had

1477
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:00,800
national weights and measures and they

1478
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,319
still do this they go and inspect each

1479
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:03,760
pump eventually every pump gets

1480
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,520
inspected i think of course about two

1481
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,520
years throughout the united states they

1482
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:08,720
open them up they inspect make sure

1483
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,480
there's no skimmers and other things too

1484
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,160
and they put a security seal on their

1485
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,839
sticker that said this pump is inspected

1486
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:15,599
and secured in a date

1487
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,520
and to a consumer they were told if you

1488
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,920
see that seal it's safe to use

1489
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,720
so now i'm a cyber criminal and what do

1490
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,960
i do on the dark web or on ebay i sell

1491
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,880
rolls of stickers that say this pump was

1492
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,640
inspected and secured so i placed my

1493
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,040
skimmer in and i placed it up there and

1494
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,920
now suddenly i'm in business now i'm

1495
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,839
having people drawn to this machine

1496
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:37,760
because it looks like it's secure for

1497
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,839
this cheap five cent

1498
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:41,200
that that's part of the problem

1499
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,960
unfortunately it's a good point i

1500
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,040
brought that up myself years ago while

1501
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,640
researching this and it bothered me to

1502
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,960
no end there's got to be something okay

1503
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,800
now here's something here's a silver

1504
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,200
lining some of it some of the stations

1505
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,920
are starting to upgrade that's good it's

1506
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,000
coming really slow taking a long time

1507
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,480
but it is starting to happen just like

1508
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,240
point-of-sale terminals

1509
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,160
for our chip and signature are happening

1510
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,800
so it's better security but it's not 100

1511
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,960
secure and again nothing is

1512
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,720
but if you go to costco i don't know if

1513
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,280
you guys have costco here in iowa

1514
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,119
costco actually is one of the few

1515
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:17,680
companies and they do sell a lot of gas

1516
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,760
and they sell it at a good rate they get

1517
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,400
the standard gas pumps in and they spend

1518
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,079
a lot of money

1519
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:26,400
ripping off all the locks and putting

1520
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,400
them in their load box

1521
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,240
so therefore the chance of finding a

1522
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,480
skipper in a costco pump is

1523
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,720
minimal unless it's an inside job or

1524
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,240
something else for what that's where

1525
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,240
nobody ever talks about that but to me

1526
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,000
if i'm a consumer that's good

1527
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,599
information to know especially if i have

1528
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,520
a hospital card and i think they're

1529
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,280
doing it right

1530
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,960
so again sometimes spending the money in

1531
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,680
the right areas makes sense

1532
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,880
so that they should certainly be

1533
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,079
applauded for that i think um

1534
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,920
just kind of in closing i briefly want

1535
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,680
to just touch the surface of this again

1536
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,359
i might be presenting later and i can

1537
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:01,440
delve in deeper here

1538
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,359
i just wanted to mention

1539
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:05,760
when credit cards and debit cards are

1540
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,520
stolen just because you steal it doesn't

1541
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,359
mean you have an audience to sell that

1542
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,520
to or a customer base how do you sell

1543
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,119
the stuff

1544
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:14,480
well that's the part that's the easy

1545
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,079
part for the cyber career most they're

1546
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:18,240
using what's called the dark web if you

1547
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,160
guys have you guys i'm assuming that's a

1548
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,160
cyber security audience you know what

1549
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,720
the dark web is if i just show of hands

1550
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,839
you've heard of it you're somewhat

1551
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:26,960
familiar okay

1552
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,040
most everybody is here

1553
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:29,839
so

1554
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:31,680
just in general the internet the surface

1555
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,760
web where we all work doing google

1556
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,079
searches and visiting different websites

1557
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:37,440
through our browser and such as about

1558
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,720
4.5 billion websites that are indexed by

1559
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,040
different search engines so the

1560
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,760
service web represents roughly two

1561
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,440
tenths of a percent

1562
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,839
of the internet right

1563
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,000
so that tells you what is below the

1564
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,720
surface web is so much bigger and so

1565
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,280
much wider and this little iceberg is

1566
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,880
the very common thing that's kind of

1567
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,720
been associated with the dark web that

1568
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,079
many people will often uh get used to

1569
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:05,839
which depicts it i think goes so well

1570
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:07,760
the google wikipedia and stuff up at the

1571
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,280
surface and all the stuff in the deep

1572
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,280
and the dark web below there and again

1573
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,960
those are really just to say it's simply

1574
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,200
it's unindexed underneath there so it's

1575
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,880
hard to find these unique sites and

1576
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,800
they're repositories it's not all bad

1577
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,680
stuff

1578
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,119
everybody associates although the dark

1579
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:23,280
web is bad and not necessarily it could

1580
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,599
be repositories of databases and patient

1581
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:28,160
information and all kinds of stuff out

1582
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,200
there

1583
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,359
but it's not indexed the same way as the

1584
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:32,480
surface

1585
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,520
so therefore to go into the dark web you

1586
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,160
have to know the specific address to get

1587
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,599
in there and the means to get in there

1588
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,359
and typically use what's called a tour

1589
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:42,400
browser

1590
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,480
and the tour network designed by the

1591
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,960
united states naval research group i

1592
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,960
believe a number of years ago so it

1593
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,720
could help people communicate

1594
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,359
anonymously and securely dissidents

1595
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:55,760
reporters anyone else can use that cyber

1596
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,000
criminals also can too because it's free

1597
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,319
and and it's very wonderful because it

1598
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:02,960
allows you to do things anonymously

1599
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,240
it'll bounce around

1600
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,400
traffic around the globe so nobody can

1601
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,960
pinpoint exactly where you are

1602
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,599
which is important the data is encrypted

1603
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:14,400
so again it protects the user there um

1604
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,920
which again is important if you're doing

1605
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,520
legal things now if you're doing illegal

1606
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,280
things it's a protection too

1607
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,720
unfortunately that's part of the

1608
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,040
challenge so on the dark web a lot of

1609
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,400
these bad guys learn wow i can hide

1610
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,319
information here i could work with other

1611
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:31,680
cyber criminals i can buy and sell guns

1612
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,319
kids drugs stolen credit cards so so

1613
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:35,119
forth

1614
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:37,440
that's a huge problem it's

1615
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,920
very successful and law enforcement's

1616
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,680
been working hard and done a great job

1617
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,880
and slowly

1618
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,400
taking down these sites you probably

1619
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,160
heard of silk road and silk road 2 and

1620
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,000
so on and so forth

1621
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,599
pretty fascinating i've done a couple of

1622
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,559
these

1623
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,319
projects working with different media

1624
00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:54,559
groups and in this particular case it

1625
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:57,040
was actually cbs what we did was i went

1626
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,640
on the dark web did research for a

1627
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,319
period of time collected masses of

1628
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,480
stolen credit card information

1629
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:05,520
uh identities social security numbers

1630
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,119
breach information

1631
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:09,040
and then i work with law enforcement and

1632
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,880
then and then they actually went out and

1633
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,599
contacted the individuals literally

1634
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:15,359
kind of knocked on their doors excuse me

1635
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:16,480
do you know your credit cards on the

1636
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,520
dark web

1637
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,280
what are you talking about and then help

1638
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,359
them remediate it was a bigger project

1639
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,799
kind of stink project but it's kind of

1640
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:24,799
cool because i got to actually collect

1641
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:27,200
all that information so that that was

1642
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,640
really neat to be able to actually see

1643
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,400
it unfortunately most of the people that

1644
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,920
were contacting had no clue their

1645
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,160
information was out there had no idea

1646
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,400
how it got out there most likely it was

1647
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,480
a skimmer that took it or they were

1648
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,799
buying something online they were going

1649
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,240
on sites that they probably shouldn't

1650
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,040
have their information was compromised

1651
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,960
and out there but it's interesting when

1652
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,359
you get behind the scenes and understand

1653
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:51,760
how fragile the whole system is

1654
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,680
yet every single one of us here has a

1655
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:54,720
credit card

1656
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,720
or debit card in our wallet or purse and

1657
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,359
uses it properly on a weekly basis

1658
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:01,920
that's scary so just before you quickly

1659
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,920
shut that card just stop and think

1660
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,319
that's what i encourage people to do

1661
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:10,400
because it's very easy to be compromised

1662
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,720
myself personally when i was targeting

1663
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,559
hacked my company a few years ago i

1664
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:18,960
think it was 11 times my card was

1665
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,400
compromised

1666
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,720
personally the company's close to that

1667
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,040
and then i had debit cards also for each

1668
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,960
so i've been through the process

1669
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,119
it's painful

1670
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,520
suffered the whole ddos attack twitter

1671
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,359
account takeover

1672
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:35,040
sixty five thousand dollars stolen from

1673
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,079
my checking account i was targeted

1674
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:40,400
and any of us could be targeted again

1675
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,720
i'm a cyber security expert

1676
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,440
what does it tell you

1677
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,079
nothing's 100 i'm sorry nothing is any

1678
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:50,400
one of us can easily be targeted to be

1679
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,000
compromised

1680
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,480
it's fairly easy to do so i just

1681
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,880
encourage you don't don't give up

1682
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,760
implementing best security practices

1683
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,200
is something that really does make a

1684
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,200
difference because what's it going to do

1685
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,119
it's going to deter the cyber criminals

1686
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:06,799
move on to the next target

1687
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:08,240
that's what's important

1688
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,559
that's really what's important

1689
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:12,480

1690
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,079

1702
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:35,440
happening and that's my story of being

1703
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,839
hacked as a company and personally what

1704
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:39,359
i went through the things i learned in

1705
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:40,480
the process

1706
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,319
and then more recently i released

1707
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:44,559
another book senior cyber and that's

1708
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:47,119
really dealing with age parents and

1709
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:49,440
grandparents trying to educate them i

1710
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,200
was so frustrated that i could not find

1711
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,119
any good information that talked at

1712
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:57,359
their level it all talked down to them

1713
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:59,359
and talked in tech jargon

1714
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:01,200
and just got people more confused i said

1715
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,319
that's it i'm going to write a book

1716
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:04,319
that's big font so everybody could read

1717
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:06,240
it without their glasses

1718
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,160
and share tips throughout and explain

1719
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,079
things without getting techy on it so

1720
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:12,240
