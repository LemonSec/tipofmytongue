1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,680
all right well i guess we'll get started

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,439
thanks everyone for uh coming in today

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,600
thanks for coming out during a uh

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,680
yeah crazy time

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,840
but uh i do want to talk about something

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,200
that's

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,280
been on the forefront of my mind

8
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,320
intended in our industry that needs more

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,880
attention as mental health and self-care

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,320
really we look at cybersecurity

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,720
professionals spend most of their days

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,439
focus on health and well-being of their

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,279
environments and their care

14
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,080
however the cost of reducing risk and

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,679
keeping our networks often comes at the

16
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,120
price of our professional's mental

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,440
health and it's just a reality so many

18
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,239
different

19
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,239
information security professionals

20
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,120
suffer from burnout suffer from anxiety

21
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,520
depression and really we often see

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,879
people turn into really unhealthy and

23
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,039
coping mechanisms which further just

24
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,399
really exacerbates a lot of these

25
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,079
otherwise problems

26
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,680
so my goal with this talk now let me

27
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,800
give you for

28
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,079
almost

29
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,079
18 months now um it's really kind of

30
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,719
legitimate

31
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,880
i'll share my journey

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,119
we kind of try to reverse engineer

33
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,799
some of the stigma about mental health

34
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,400
in our business and a couple of ways

35
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,680
that we can

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,040
really hack mental health and more

37
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,479
productive ways

38
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,159
i will say there are some things that

39
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,960
are going to accomplish

40
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,200
[Music]

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,000
can make you feel like you're

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,920
experiencing past trauma so trigger some

43
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,079
level of psd sometimes

44
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,360
you don't even know why it's happening

45
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,280
you know listening to something

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,960
earlier this year it was a tim ferriss

47
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,399
podcast he was talking about early

48
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,840
childhood trauma

49
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,000
and i found myself really upset by it

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,560
like physically not feeling loud and i

51
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,759
don't know why but those were these

52
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,920
triggers um and that would just turn it

53
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,719
off

54
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,960
something that was okay that was

55
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,719
triggering something so if there's

56
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,920
anything i'm talking about that makes

57
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,520
you feel uncomfortable do not have to

58
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,640
sit through it

59
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,959
just unplug walk away that's completely

60
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,840
fine and feel bad

61
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,000
uh

62
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,000
the standard disclaimers are not adopted

63
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,680
or what i played on tv

64
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,280
so the

65
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,959
content of this presentation is meant

66
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,879
for information courses only not a

67
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,040
substitute for medical advice

68
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,120
all content including text

69
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,680
graphics images and information is only

70
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,120
just for general information purposes

71
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,239
only

72
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,760
i splunk

73
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,760
foreign

74
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,760
information contained or available these

75
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,879
presentations

76
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,560
this is not medical advice

77
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,400
never disregard professional medical

78
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,440
opinions or if you need help get up

79
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,720
there you got regular wednesday

80
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,319
and when we talk about some of these

81
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,400
topics there's important definitions of

82
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,160
context so mental health from health and

83
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,239
human services

84
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,480
includes our emotional

85
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,879
psychological social well-being

86
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,040
it affects how we think feel and act it

87
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,879
also helps determine how we handle

88
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,040
stress relate to others and make our

89
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,599
choices so many factors contribute to

90
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,040
mental health problems including

91
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,680
biological factors such as genetics

92
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,480
brain chemistry life experiences such as

93
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,640
past trauma reviews and or family

94
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,599
history of past mental health issues

95
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,280
so that's kind of the health and human

96
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,720
services

97
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,720
version of mental health

98
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,200
self-care is any activity that we do

99
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,640
deliberately so it's these things that

100
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,640
you really need to

101
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,640
in order to take care of your emotional

102
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,360
mental and physical health

103
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,959
they're not passive actions but the

104
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,400
things that you really come again that

105
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,720
are self-initiated that you go through

106
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,480
and it can be self-control

107
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,480
and neurodiversity is a relatively new

108
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,239
topic but it's something that i deal

109
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,799
with at work a lot because i'm on the

110
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,040
employee resource group for

111
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,680
neurodiversity it just encompasses a lot

112
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,040
of different areas so the definition

113
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,640
that i've kind of heard multiple sources

114
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,480
that i've been using is

115
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,400
murder versus the idea that neurological

116
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,439
differences like autism adhd

117
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,640
mood and other functions that have

118
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,120
historically been viewed with this very

119
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,360
negative perception are the results

120
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,040
quite frankly just normal variations in

121
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,120
the human genome it's part of evolution

122
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,918
as we change and grows as a species so

123
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,079
this represents a new and but really

124
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,840
different way of looking at conditions

125
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,880
that will traditionally pathologize

126
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,400
and it's a viewpoint that's not

127
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,919
universally accepted but it's getting

128
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,080
more and more support through science so

129
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,840
that's good

130
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,919
and it's this idea that neurodiversity

131
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,000
and neurodiversity advocates point out

132
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,080
that neurodivergent people often have

133
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,639
exceptional abilities alongside

134
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,199
what society is traditionally viewed as

135
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,040
problematic or disability so we try to

136
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,680
look at it and know that when you have

137
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,440
brain functions

138
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,960
they're not disabilities or just

139
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,800
differences it's almost like

140
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,120
different operating systems everything

141
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,800
is a little different how you interact

142
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,080
with those operating systems might be

143
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,160
different ones not necessarily

144
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,080
better or worse than the others whatever

145
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,280
works but

146
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,400
going into what we're going to talk

147
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,160
about today i'm not going to die between

148
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,960
a reversing

149
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,400
i've been talking about cyber security

150
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,800
19 for 30 years in front of audiences

151
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,720
uh and right now i really changed my

152
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,440
focus to diversity causes

153
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,039
mental health and other

154
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,080
issues

155
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,360
and it's

156
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,960
interesting because you know

157
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,199
i can tell some of those crazy apt

158
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,560
stories of chasing people out of

159
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,720
networks from state-sponsored threat

160
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,800
actors people like that's cool and i do

161
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,720
this talk generally people who send a

162
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,240
lot of messages afterwards saying thank

163
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,840
you for talking about this this is

164
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,520
something we're not talking about about

165
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,759
so once i started doing that i realized

166
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,039
that this was something i really need to

167
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,720
dig further into and continue to speak

168
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,199
about because it's i'm talking about one

169
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,360
of the other areas of sound security and

170
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,680
fixing enterprise networks for so long

171
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,520
um i might as well try to fix people

172
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,120
government as well because the people

173
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,639
process technology

174
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,000
the people are really showing the

175
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,440
support of them

176
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,120
but after looking at how long i've been

177
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,960
doing some level of instant response or

178
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,720
crisis management i really think that's

179
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,520
like where i stand out professionally

180
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,280
is being able to

181
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,720
deal with

182
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,840
high stress environments and

183
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,639
this is a plaque i got in 1996 where a

184
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,800
friend of mine we were a ski trip

185
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,840
we were back skiing was

186
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,919
he falls gets hurt he's crying i went

187
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,400
and got help i got him situated and they

188
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,080
they gave me an award for like clear

189
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,400
thinking in a crisis situation and it

190
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,080
really sort of relates to everything

191
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,199
i've been doing my whole life because i

192
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,800
really think of myself as a wolf in

193
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,440
surveys from pulp fiction where i can go

194
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,520
into crisis situations you need to hear

195
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,960
what the dead body just called but you

196
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,639
have to do what i say when i say it and

197
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,599
do it

198
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,120
it's focused

199
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,599
because i don't tend to get shaken in

200
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,319
these environments

201
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,620
[Music]

202
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,319
my mind just goes into that zone

203
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,919
but i have really bad design like

204
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,840
crippling anxiety attacks and it doesn't

205
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,880
show and so that's the monster in the

206
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,560
closet it's been something i've been

207
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,080
dealing with for so long so even though

208
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,599
i can do

209
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,639
all these things almost seamless kind of

210
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,199
way it's underlying means it's a fight

211
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,720
every day you know something i have to

212
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,960
deal with i'll talk a little bit into my

213
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,400
journey about it but it is something

214
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,360
that is

215
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,759
part of who i am um i can't change and i

216
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,840
just have to accept advantage

217
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,280
even though i can do this things really

218
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,599
well this is something that's part of my

219
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,599
uh

220
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,360
and the reality is as i started talking

221
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,560
about it

222
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,800
more and more um i started seeing all

223
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,319
the research that supported the fact

224
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,639
that i'm not alone in this and that

225
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,240
a lot of folks feel the pressure of

226
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,639
these environments and would not manage

227
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,720
properly to really have some long-term

228
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,960
effects and andrea marcus said in an

229
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,639
interview a couple years ago there's

230
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,120
never a downtime it's not stopping every

231
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,039
day it's about and that's cyber security

232
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,280
it's just it's on and you're worried

233
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,400
about things that are going to happen

234
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,360
every day

235
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,360
but frankly you have to be right scenes

236
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,560
all the time

237
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,560
and attackers get to be right once or

238
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,240
twice

239
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,919
exploit a couple more abilities and get

240
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,599
in we're trying to manage massive

241
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,120
environments or visibility it's

242
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,199
stressful so it's known it's really

243
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,120
surprised that depression around even

244
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,280
suicide becoming more common with

245
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,120
cybersecurity professionals

246
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,320
really when you look at it from the

247
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,839
world health organization they say

248
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,120
depression is the leading cause of

249
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,279
disability in the world

250
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,760
heart disease so this is it's a serious

251
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,559
issue

252
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,679
and then people with mental health

253
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,760
conditions are the highest risk root for

254
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,360
suicide

255
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,720
most of my days

256
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,399
focus in with almost coaching and

257
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,120
mentoring csos and how to manage their

258
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,120
environment be more business focused and

259
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,480
i started looking at some of the numbers

260
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,000
specifically for that curricular quotes

261
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
that i deal with on a daily basis of

262
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,120
csus

263
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,200
so there was spending done in 2019 and

264
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,160
this is just for cesar's gold season

265
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,279
but i think the numbers can really

266
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,600
extrapolate well instead you know about

267
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,000
91 percent of the cso survey said their

268
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,839
levels of stress they were suffering

269
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,640
from moderate to high

270
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,800
sixty percent rarely disconnected from

271
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,160
their work role

272
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,200
88

273
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,240
work more than 40 hours per week with 27

274
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,800
working 60 hours a week in the world 89

275
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
percent of us-based cso's have never had

276
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,519
a 2-week vacation in the world

277
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,160
that's insane you know

278
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,160
and most feel about their teams are

279
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,160
unappreciated by senior leadership and

280
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,560
almost all field outreach was inevitable

281
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,839
but they're seeing those in these

282
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:42,959
organizations

283
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,440
and surveys only about 15 to 60 percent

284
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,120
of that breach was memorable so it's a

285
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,160
huge parody or a disparity i should say

286
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,839
in the way that

287
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,560
organizational leaders look at things as

288
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,160
far as impacting business from a cyber

289
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,839
event versus what diseases have to do

290
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:58,880
with the daily

291
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,880
basis but all these seasons nothing

292
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,959
either written up or could potentially

293
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,640
lose their job if there wasn't reached

294
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,880
so it's there's no surprise really that

295
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,200
there's this high turnover

296
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,000
in

297
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,839
these roles you know we normally see

298
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,920
individuals that are in their roles for

299
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,920
about 18 months they start maybe

300
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,279
affecting change at that point they're

301
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,519
burned out done with senior leadership

302
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,560
move up

303
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,560
enough cso comes in

304
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,920
they take about six to eight months to

305
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,000
cover their speed by the time they get

306
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,680
momentum really go they leave so it's

307
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,440
this vicious cycle it's only talk from

308
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,440
tone from the top of government's

309
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,880
leadership

310
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,480
my name is that mental health has to be

311
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,839
part of this as well we have to kind of

312
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,680
govern this down and really support that

313
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,800
a little bit more levels

314
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,600
because we're not really getting the

315
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,640
changes out on one scene

316
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,120
and

317
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,519
people not having the tools for stress

318
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,720
management

319
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,079
it really exacerbates a lot of

320
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,519
underlying issues

321
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,279
and some of the tools that we'll talk

322
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,959
about later but that we've done

323
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,399
traditionally it's been

324
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,320
coaching coping mechanisms

325
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,160
it's been you know if you go to

326
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,240
you know hacker summer camp it's been

327
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,160
alcohol drugs strip clubs i mean it's

328
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,920
just a party scene

329
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,519
to blow up steam that's not for

330
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,399
everybody

331
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,399
and jamie tomsela said it a couple years

332
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,519
ago

333
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,000
speaking of black hat 2018

334
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,440
she would talk about the stigma being a

335
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,600
recovering alcoholic in this

336
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,640
community

337
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,360
really hard yeah

338
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,720
we did a couple weeks ago at

339
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,320
blue team comp done at an involved

340
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,279
attack

341
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,320
but then they

342
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,399
provide these other safe spaces so as

343
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,440
community

344
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,519
we needed more of these types of things

345
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,839
to support our

346
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,440
members in our community with other

347
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,959
factors and other things to

348
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,720
develop the stress management techniques

349
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,079
because we've really done a miscourt job

350
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,160
and i'm obviously

351
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,000
not against going out and having fun but

352
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,519
i think it needs to have some balance

353
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,279
and that's one of the things from her

354
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,200
community it should not be our only

355
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,320
answer

356
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,079
and again i've been really bad about

357
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,920
that and

358
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,760
i'm trying to do better i hope everybody

359
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,200
else will too

360
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
because it's it's not okay to say kind

361
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,160
of velocity and just go

362
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,200
we don't

363
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,720
do

364
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,560
enough layered security in our mental

365
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,040
health as much as we do in our you know

366
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,480
environments it's not like saying hey

367
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,839
we're just going to throw an ap it will

368
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,360
be good and the same thing more this

369
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,720
thing now let's go more outcomes

370
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,959
protect our neural networks as well

371
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,560
and really kind of maintain this layer

372
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,920
of mental health

373
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,519
because it's getting worse this last

374
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,040
year i think we all know has been it's

375
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,959
been full of suck

376
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,880
you know out of the corona has just been

377
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,079
made thing that has really exacerbated a

378
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,320
lot of people it's been a hard year

379
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,880
people who have lost loved ones

380
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,120
distracted working school routines

381
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,200
i'm used to doing this on the road all

382
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,800
the time and this is only like my third

383
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,079
in speaking event in those two years

384
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,920
and i'm not used to not being in front

385
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,920
of people and it's really thrown off my

386
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,040
game

387
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,240
and

388
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,240
i'm not looking for painting but to say

389
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,920
we're not alone in this if this is the

390
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,000
way you feel there's multiple times

391
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,519
today that i'm talking to friends and

392
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,040
family that really start to struggle

393
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,360
with this this is long-term effect as

394
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
this

395
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,279
languishing as i call it

396
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,399
with uh clover right now it's just one

397
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,800
quote i saw and it describes it

398
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,480
somewhat accurately it's this

399
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,800
unrelenting horizon also the coded world

400
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,240
like when is this kind of just feels

401
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,760
like it's never commented

402
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,279
on delta

403
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,079
so again we have to do things that are

404
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,079
better at this point managing this and

405
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,920
again for me i feel

406
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,440
helpless at times because there's people

407
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,519
that i want to help and i can't because

408
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,120
of this environment so it sucks for me

409
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,360
not to be able to scoop in like the wolf

410
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,519
from whole fiction just fix everything

411
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,440
there's just things i cannot do right

412
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,600
now and so we're all starting to feel

413
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,240
that and it's getting worse you know

414
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,560
one of the long tail effects of in this

415
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,639
language is burnout these mental health

416
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,839
is suicide

417
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,600
i live in colorado we're seeing a spike

418
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,240
in it both just about every age you can

419
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,279
imagine

420
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,000
there is an increase in suicide

421
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,079
and they're otherwise and it's great

422
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,680
people feel helpless

423
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,399
but again one of my favorite bands of

424
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,040
all time is h2o

425
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,199
because

426
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,800
this is such a great quote from james

427
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,920
baldwin you know not everything that can

428
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,839
not everything back in space can change

429
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,760
but nothing can be changed until this

430
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,680
face so we have to

431
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,839
go at these issues and we have to talk

432
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,279
about mental health

433
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,639
and it cannot be what it is

434
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,199
and so i really try to pledge this

435
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,800
community to continue to talk about it

436
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,360
raise awareness

437
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,360
i definitely do not have all the answers

438
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,440
and i won't pretend to but i'm not going

439
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,959
to be shy about talking about those

440
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,399
issues any longer

441
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,920
because as hackers we can figure this

442
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,920
out and organize so with every problem

443
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,279
there's a solution

444
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,760
together so the obviously corona side

445
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,360
which is the elephant in the room has

446
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,079
only

447
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,760
exacerbated a lot of these overlying

448
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,040
issues

449
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,040
and i really didn't start doing some

450
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,720
root cause analysis of a profession

451
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,279
itself how did we get here how are

452
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,399
how are we

453
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,079
at the point where people are going out

454
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,320
and feeling unsupported

455
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,519
mentally and if you really think about

456
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,040
what cyber security is it's still a

457
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,199
relatively new industry but really the

458
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,040
way i look at our teenage years is this

459
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,839
frankenstein monster that has been long

460
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,320
together from i.t consulting operations

461
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,839
legal compliance

462
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,759
privacy so we have a bit of an identity

463
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,680
crisis right now and it's made it harder

464
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,680
to really understand what works and what

465
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,920
doesn't so there's a lot of good in our

466
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,360
business practices but there's also a

467
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,839
lot of negatives and so i've seen one of

468
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,440
the things we have to change is removing

469
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,720
some of this pressure and really

470
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,560
stopping things better

471
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,560
so it's not this idea well you have to

472
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,399
work harder you have to toughen down you

473
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,920
know you have this high legalization

474
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,839
rates you just have to go to local

475
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,199
compression regression pressure is

476
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,360
winning and i think i've done really

477
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,480
well in that environment but it's

478
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,600
definitely not for everybody it's

479
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,839
probably hurt a lot in the industry

480
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,240
so it's even done things in my own

481
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,680
behavior

482
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,680
that's that's caused problems i think in

483
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,720
the industry because i've supported a

484
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,839
little bit

485
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,600
because this mental construct of just

486
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,759
pressure and now this work for

487
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:36,800
and

488
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,399
some of the things i started looking at

489
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,639
as i started hiring like younger proud

490
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,639
folks over the past 10 years

491
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,079
they were like we don't want to do that

492
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,320
we've seen that affect our parents we've

493
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,240
seen that

494
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,720
in my family i don't want to work eight

495
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,920
hours a week don't work four hours a

496
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,680
week on my weekends off and i'll be able

497
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,120
to turn off

498
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,480
and then wanted a better work life

499
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,639
balance so that was me as a leader i

500
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,160
thought okay how do we do that that's

501
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,680
never been in the way

502
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,000
and as i started looking at it there was

503
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,679
ways to do that i'll talk about that a

504
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:06,880
little bit later

505
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,480
um

506
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,640
but it can be done we can do this

507
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,559
work-life balance

508
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,160
and i know it sucks because we feel that

509
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,319
okay well you know lives can't literally

510
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,480
be online with a lot of what we do

511
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,319
and it's different than what we trained

512
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,079
in somebody's a pure

513
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,799
i.t with a lot of things in i.t

514
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,400
you can blame a bad patch certainly

515
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,919
those down okay

516
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,039
but

517
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,840
nobody really gets

518
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,960
it's usually involved that some part of

519
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,400
that people process acknowledging that

520
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,240
people part somebody missed something so

521
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,600
they're feeling

522
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,280
that stress they're feeling that weight

523
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,520
we don't teach people how to cope with

524
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,760
that level of stress and we've called

525
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,200
organizational harm and if you're in

526
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,200
certain industries if you're a motif or

527
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,120
medical that could be somebody's life

528
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,120
and we don't really provide a new

529
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,280
foundation as an industry to help people

530
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,440
cope with that level of stress and

531
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,799
that's one of the things i think we'll

532
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,960
have to work on changing because it's

533
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,120
not very healthy or skilled

534
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,880
so i'll talk a little bit about my dream

535
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,080
in general

536
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,679
and

537
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,720
i was born in 1976

538
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,160
so i'm 30 years old and

539
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,600
but you know i grew up in the 80s and

540
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,280
90s and

541
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,120
for me it was this

542
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,640
it was

543
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,000
pumpkin hard for pumpkin hardcore music

544
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,080
skateboarding comic books all the things

545
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,760
that are cool now that actually get a

546
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,320
lot of attention work or got my ass

547
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,400
kicked high school for yeah so it was

548
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,919
really tough i always felt like the odd

549
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,600
man how um you know socially and

550
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,600
organizationally in school i just didn't

551
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,039
fit in

552
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,559
i got through

553
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,080
and then graduated high school but i

554
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,760
never really

555
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,280
felt like i belonged there and the lord

556
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,360
was like you're smart but you know this

557
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,520
is not the right organization for you so

558
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,200
i kind of got through but it sucked and

559
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,160
i really didn't have good um i would say

560
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,480
coping mechanisms my parents

561
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,640
my sisters all really kind of

562
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,600
type a personality so by the time i'm

563
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,280
getting towards my

564
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,880
years of getting collagen it was kind of

565
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,760
what are you going to do what are you

566
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,039
going to do and i just felt the pressure

567
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,080
that's getting out of high school i'm

568
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,360
prepared to

569
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,080
meet the real world and

570
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,880
you know i started with some friends and

571
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,559
some friends were like oh obviously they

572
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,520
happen to

573
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,840
you sneak beards get weak whatever it is

574
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,679
i had smoked something and i had never

575
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,240
done that and it was fun the second time

576
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,120
massive attack what turns out is that in

577
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,120
my brain chemistry there's

578
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,360
um just imbalances i didn't know about

579
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,960
so a lot of this underlying stress

580
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,520
anxious being really manifested itself

581
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,120
really horribly by a chemical that threw

582
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,880
something off was because of basically

583
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,480
the difference between the synthetic

584
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,480
parasympatic nervous system so the

585
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,880
synthetic nervous system is what

586
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,320
prepares the body for that fight or

587
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,400
flight mode uh the parasympathetic

588
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
nervous system it hits the body from

589
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,559
overworking and restores that balance

590
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,640
mine goes off and mine was just in like

591
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,600
full out

592
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,440
just rush mode i felt like i was going

593
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,640
to die

594
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,159
i didn't know what was going on this

595
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,240
went on for days in and out of the

596
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,600
hospital when

597
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,960
parents were taking notice i was like my

598
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,720
heart was racing like there's nothing

599
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,080
wrong with blood tests coming right it

600
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,520
finally took about

601
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,520
three or four doctors to

602
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,880
maybe you're having like massive panic

603
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,039
attacks and anxieties what is that we

604
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,039
didn't know it wasn't something that was

605
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,600
readily talked about in the early 90s

606
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,520
and he said yeah go downstairs to the

607
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,120
psychiatrist downstairs and he'll get

608
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,760
you sorted out and did and i sought got

609
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,360
help that i needed

610
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,880
but was that really that first bout of

611
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,440
anxiety in the early 90s that i but i

612
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,960
didn't know what was going on

613
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,159
and didn't know it was this online

614
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,039
medical condition so it

615
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,520
became something that i kind of worked

616
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,919
out of high school and like okay

617
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,039
well i'm really into computers and

618
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,799
technology and people were like well you

619
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,799
live in an ibm country but working with

620
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,039
building mainframes can i not do that is

621
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,640
there anything other than that because

622
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,840
there was these computers things

623
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,760
computers this internet this stuff might

624
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,919
have caught on but you know this was

625
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,159
growing even in the 90s why don't we why

626
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,600
am i not focusing there well that's

627
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,960
where those people are spending time

628
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,880
with technology and business in their

629
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,480
personal lives but there wasn't a

630
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,480
program for it so i'd go out and start a

631
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,520
business

632
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,360
doing a lot of kind of great fix stuff

633
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,600
it was a managed service provider it's

634
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,320
not

635
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,919
worked really well i

636
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,960
had this huge market share you know

637
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,640
totally addressable marketplace all

638
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,640
these people that had home computers and

639
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,240
business computers that would not be

640
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,400
held and i was business called computer

641
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,679
house calls

642
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,919
i was able to market it got a bunch of

643
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,840
press and pr it took off and i was doing

644
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,280
really well eventually i started getting

645
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,200
some more enterprise clients and

646
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,720
eventually i had merrill lynch and all

647
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,159
these big banks i was doing work for

648
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,320
them and going to convention centers

649
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,840
like this because you know i've been

650
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,000
traveling since the

651
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,360
before when my parents had their own

652
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,440
consulting business but i was traveling

653
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,360
the world setting up networks

654
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,480
and i was just going ongoing and then i

655
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,720
had another kind of burnout

656
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,039
trigger event in the late 90s that

657
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,640
really was my first bad burnout that

658
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,400
brought back a lot of those

659
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,000
parasympathetic

660
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,240
synthetic imbalances and i was just

661
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,320
totally crushed i was unable to do

662
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,919
anything the anxiety depression just

663
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,840
came in i couldn't work i mean i was

664
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,400
literally just because i was just going

665
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,640
15 16 hours a day and traveling and just

666
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,799
going going and it was just i never gave

667
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,640
myself any down time so i worked out

668
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,679
hard

669
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,039
and had to step after everything for

670
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,039
about two months kind of like get myself

671
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,559
every morning

672
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,600
and it was uh it was a really

673
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,520
tough period that i got out of this well

674
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,600
that was nothing that i triggered it

675
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,720
because i was thinking well then i was

676
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,960
like

677
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,480
through the early 2000s i

678
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,919
met my

679
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,159
ex-wife at the time we

680
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,720
got married in 2008 we had a kid and

681
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,880
then 2012 comes around and now i'm a kid

682
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,400
and i'm having a lot of running my own

683
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,960
businesses so at this time i had a

684
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,480
company called digital friends here in

685
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,520
new york city

686
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,240
doing cyber security litigation work

687
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,000
and i had to kind of give that up and

688
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,840
people wasting my entrepreneurial stuff

689
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,600
to go in the house to a company because

690
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,760
they had health care you know it was a

691
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,280
big thing it was a big light choice for

692
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,520
me to have to support my family it was

693
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,520
the new identity crisis because we as

694
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,120
entrepreneurs somebody has always been

695
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,440
against the system having to go into

696
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,120
dufferin phelps versus an institutional

697
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,799
banking consulting firm

698
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,880
and put on the suit every day and do

699
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,840
that it was just a

700
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,799
an odd cultural thing for me

701
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,080
it didn't feel right but i had to get

702
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,279
through it it was

703
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,559
kind of going through the motions and

704
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,840
that was really what set into what

705
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,679
this kind of lethargic

706
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,360
low-level depression that went on for

707
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,640
years that i really didn't understand

708
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,559
why i was so unhappy because i really

709
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:57,840
didn't

710
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,039
work through these issues really

711
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,440
understanding i just felt i had to do it

712
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,279
um and that went on forward i'd say

713
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,760
until about

714
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,200
2015-16 where i was like i can't likely

715
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,640
do this anymore i was working at a

716
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,919
company where

717
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,679
culturally was bad fit but i was going

718
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,679
to make some changes with the leadership

719
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,120
that i had there

720
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,840
and

721
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,520
even in my home life where i struggled

722
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,840
with some things um my expectations like

723
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,679
i just i have to change

724
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,320
and then again i actually some of it

725
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,760
when you find happiness in life is not

726
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,440
always self-initiated i basically had um

727
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,520
the manager i was working with my mentor

728
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,279
female from dublin falls to this other

729
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,320
company

730
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,679
they fired him

731
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:36,559
like

732
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,360
unceremoniously in front of like us the

733
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,520
team where we had about 15 people

734
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,960
so we'll come here now

735
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,039
you're the new leader of this group you

736
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,559
don't have to stay we're going to be

737
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,520
opposed but if if you if you decide i'm

738
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,360
saying to me right now too

739
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,039
um thanks

740
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,200
okay so this is kind of sophie's choice

741
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,760
that i'd deal with but i went in and

742
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,440
took things on and i had okay enough

743
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,520
people that are directly reported to me

744
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,279
i have a big piano i don't know and i

745
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,960
really kind of something just click that

746
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,000
pressure that

747
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,559
turned on where i was able to

748
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,520
really dig into things and

749
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,279
get things going i started practicing

750
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,039
meditation and those other things in

751
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,159
self-care

752
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,080
it really focusing on organizational

753
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,520
management and caring for the people in

754
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,640
my care

755
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,080
and things got better things got better

756
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,159
at home things got better at work and i

757
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,200
went through this

758
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,520
kind of rebound i was feeling

759
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,039
alive again because i was now under

760
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,240
control about the destiny of this

761
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,440
company they were giving me a lot of

762
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,520
free reign to do this and i was back

763
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,279
through my entrepreneurial self working

764
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,240
with the company so it was very

765
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,760
entrepreneurial

766
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,200
and this went out great but then i felt

767
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,760
like living in new york city with a kid

768
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,080
a dog and i'm traveling all the time

769
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,000
the ex-wife started to take the kid in

770
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,960
and out of

771
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,880
the building well that's just

772
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,400
one of those things that was obviously

773
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,679
great so you have to live better because

774
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,080
it's a stressful environment but if i'm

775
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,279
focused on

776
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,880
self-care in a better environment where

777
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,880
we go and i literally did risk

778
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,240
management i pulled out a map of the

779
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,679
united states looked at everywhere that

780
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,720
had fault lines protected potential

781
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,480
uh nuclear strikes

782
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,520
i looked at everything from risk

783
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,039
management perspectives about opening

784
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,279
the data center so wow colorado keeps

785
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,240
coming up as a great place to live

786
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,440
um

787
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,240
great quality of life schools

788
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,760
i can live with my income so i'm going

789
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,760
to go there i mean and i would we're

790
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,520
going to go wagons

791
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,600
made this decision to move from brooklyn

792
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,840
to colorado

793
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,440
two weeks before we're about to move

794
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,120
we're packing up everything and they're

795
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,960
showing our apartment in brooklyn

796
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,320
and we're just basically going to try to

797
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,640
find a place to go have

798
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,600
lunch

799
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,120
and

800
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,520
all i see is coming out as a car just

801
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,440
out of nowhere we were going through an

802
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,679
intersection with somebody on the phone

803
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,520
wasn't paying attention blew through the

804
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,480
red light hit us just missed my center i

805
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,120
spun us around

806
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,799
um

807
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,440
and it was an incredibly just

808
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,640
crazy event that was just traumatic

809
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,400
but at the time i didn't feel anything i

810
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,000
was all adrenaline but the next day when

811
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,440
i woke up i couldn't move and my entire

812
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,480
right-hand side of my body was

813
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,559
just in an excruciating pain when it

814
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,600
happened was

815
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,120
during this period i blew out two discs

816
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,720
in my back and i didn't even know at the

817
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,840
time because it was just getting the

818
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,600
adrenaline's going but the discs are

819
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,520
bulging so bad that they're chris got a

820
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,200
nerve that i couldn't i couldn't lay

821
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,440
down it couldn't sit down

822
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,279
it was just

823
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,200
non-stop pain 24 hours a day physically

824
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
and then also i'm like oh how am i going

825
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,799
to move like i got to help my family

826
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,360
move across the country and i can barely

827
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,120
move my body

828
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,559
and then you know making this big leap

829
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,000
of faith with the company that moved

830
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,320
office out to colorado and

831
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,159
i can't show them that i'm not having

832
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,840
this weakness now so i just try to bury

833
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,120
and get through it

834
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,640
and it was really

835
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,039
upsetting time sitting and trying to

836
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,159
orient

837
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,720
this idea of moving some

838
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,960
you know this entire family west to get

839
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,039
into a safer place i can't do anything i

840
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,200
felt completely debilitating when we get

841
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,679
out to colorado and

842
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:12,799
you know i'm trying to get through this

843
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,840
i'm getting some

844
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,600
amazing pt and other medical care

845
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,880
because it's

846
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,120
really colorado you have

847
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,240
doctors that deal with olympiads and

848
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,240
all the professional athletes so i was

849
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,399
getting people to lost care

850
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:31,279
which is great because pain was going on

851
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,720
the words trying to grab there's going

852
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,000
to be surgery

853
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,080
um now i'll get through it and then

854
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,399
about a month into it

855
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,039
i had um got a phone call from the

856
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,559
company they said hey just want you to

857
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,200
have a caller

858
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,200
immediately and i'm watching them

859
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,880
reloading my computer just turning it

860
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,720
off as i'm talking to them

861
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,039
and it was just for like

862
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,799
how did i stand like what was your

863
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,640
seventh package and i'm like not saying

864
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,440
like

865
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,480
you know who i am but i've been an

866
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,840
executive level

867
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,760
he did a job tomorrow like not in my

868
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,840
role that's like as a security that

869
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,520
takes six to eight months happening i

870
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,039
don't need to make a lot of choices like

871
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,159
that it's not

872
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,559
it's gonna go up into a montreal job

873
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,799
this is my life and career like

874
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,480
not our problem to them

875
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,000
it's a business decision you're just

876
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,399
aligned on spreadsheet and it's just

877
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:25,200
this

878
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,080
total punch of god to say like i'm here

879
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,600
i'm like physically in pain you're

880
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,960
cutting off my

881
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,799
health care you're coming off my source

882
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,480
of income i just spent everything to get

883
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,679
out here

884
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,919
um the little heads up would be nice and

885
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,880
i'm just like you're just

886
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,200
a line on a balance sheet

887
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,960
and so i was like okay okay i'll just

888
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,399
fight through it's like the rules let's

889
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:49,520
keep going

890
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,279
i will really kind of process this right

891
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,960
now i'll get through it i started doing

892
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,559
some stuff in the local community out

893
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,399
there reached out to

894
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,320
the cesar community i knew so with those

895
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,640
in issa osaka

896
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,159
with security you're like well yeah get

897
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,720
involved with b science denver which i

898
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,120
spoke at and organized yesterday but

899
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,960
four years ago i was like i'm gonna jump

900
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,799
into this and i'm not physically or

901
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,320
mentally really good about this one but

902
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,640
i'm just gonna ignore that and i

903
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,600
remember moving a box of um there's a

904
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,200
bunch of routers and power cables that

905
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,919
was gonna break down the network

906
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,840
so whatever like little steps that i had

907
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,600
made were just totally washed away and

908
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,039
the pain was even worse than it was

909
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,159
before

910
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,960
and that's like really when it all hit

911
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,399
everything kind of collapsed around me

912
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:35,600
at that

913
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,799
specifically

914
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,600
lining up for in so much pain

915
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,440
and just really the the weight of the

916
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,880
world in the closing round with the

917
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,720
feeling of the car accident

918
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,919
the

919
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,840
loss of the job the move everything just

920
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,159
started impacting you and look at this

921
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,559
scale of home training spills really

922
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,480
kind of measures these levels of stress

923
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,880
in your life and when you

924
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,360
compound these levels of risk um you're

925
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,399
trying to avoid getting 150 scores it's

926
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,559
like a cvss score of a

927
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,000
three below

928
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,799
not maintain low level stuff um

929
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,640
unfortunately you know

930
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,120
i got up to over 400 um when i really

931
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,519
got this up and that's like

932
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,440
that's bad

933
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,519
the high numbers are bad over three and

934
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,440
look at 300 points or more is an 80

935
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,080
chance of help right now i'm well i'm

936
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,840
just unable to

937
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,120
function

938
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,720
everything that i've ever felt before

939
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,360
came as far as anxiety depression

940
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,679
and my mental pain was

941
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,919
unbelievably high

942
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,840
so again one being the feeling of you

943
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,760
know emotional leash deletion you deal

944
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,799
with stress again stress is not bad

945
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,320
in your life in your human environment

946
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,559
it helps do a lot of things but it's a

947
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,799
balance and if you start looking at some

948
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,480
of these things that were

949
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,399
more on the severe scale

950
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,640
you know i was easily out of tense if

951
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,840
not

952
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,279
again the worst mental emotional

953
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,279
distress possible covered by physical

954
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,200
pain that's neurological

955
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,840
the inability to take care of my family

956
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,159
um and basically this this sense of

957
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,240
worth being taken away again i was just

958
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,919
a number on balance sheet that got taken

959
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:12,720
out

960
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,399
and i can't take care of my family i'm

961
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,480
in physical pain and the depression just

962
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,440
started

963
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,440
setting up it was inevitable everything

964
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,519
that i was fighting against to not

965
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,000
manage and not

966
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,279
deal with

967
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,159
came crashing in and so this is about so

968
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,240
we moved in march

969
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,360
april

970
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,120
15 17

971
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,640
time frames right after easter is when

972
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,000
they

973
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,720
ripped us off um

974
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,679
early days when we took my back and by

975
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:42,480
june

976
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,559
i was just

977
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,399
i was just basically functions i

978
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:47,279
couldn't

979
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,240
sleep i couldn't eat that couldn't stay

980
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,399
awake like everything was just this

981
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,360
weird kind of moment of just feeling so

982
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,679
detached and valid and worthless

983
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,919
and you know father's day is coming up

984
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,200
and it's

985
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,120
you know mid-june and i'm just feeling

986
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,120
like i'm the worst version of a father

987
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,360
here i am

988
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,200
and it's really dark thick to have to

989
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,360
feel and live with your feet

990
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,440
there's nothing left worth living for

991
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,960
and that you're on your life into your

992
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,080
family

993
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,080
and willing sauron

994
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,559
styron wrote this because 1999 about

995
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:37,679
depression

996
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,679
and usually not a slice and put a lot of

997
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:40,799
text out but i think this is one of

998
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,120
those important ones to kind of read and

999
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,039
hear at the same time because it really

1000
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,360
sets

1001
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,120
he says it's so eloquently like how you

1002
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,880
feel at that time he says the great

1003
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,200
drizzle of horror reduced by depression

1004
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,279
takes on the quality of physical pain

1005
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,360
but it's not an immediately identifiable

1006
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,440
thing like that of a broken balloon it

1007
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,799
might be more accurate to say that

1008
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,600
despair owning some evil trick played

1009
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,279
upon the sick brain-invited handling

1010
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,760
psyche hung to resemble the diabolical

1011
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,440
discomfort of being imprisoned and

1012
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,199
fiercely overheated

1013
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,359
because no breeze stirs his culture

1014
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,040
because when there's no escape from this

1015
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,119
smothering confinement it's entirely

1016
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,800
natural after the victim

1017
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,079
begins to think ceaselessly

1018
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,199
and uh yeah that was nothing more than

1019
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,719
what i could say after that it was it

1020
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,399
was just a

1021
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,719
dark pain of despair and i had no health

1022
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,199
care i can't even get mental health

1023
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,000
support because we're so

1024
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,639
poorly designing this this

1025
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,159
country when it comes to health care

1026
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,800
about tying into a job which i now don't

1027
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,599
have

1028
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,800
social services i could get

1029
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,040
help with you know i was on some

1030
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,960
government aid at that point

1031
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,560
basically

1032
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,480
government food stamps i couldn't get

1033
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,560
health care i was not unplugging

1034
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,359
everything just felt like i just

1035
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,040
couldn't survive

1036
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,119
but i luckily found

1037
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,960
after calling around somebody that was

1038
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,200
willing to see me right away he said oh

1039
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,240
yeah i deal with high stress

1040
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,160
professionals all the time that you're

1041
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,760
not alone

1042
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,440
you've seen them treat a lot of people

1043
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,400
in your

1044
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,760
position so i'm wondering not a little

1045
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,280
too his way out but you need to kind of

1046
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,280
follow the directions and he became that

1047
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,680
girl he was like you know shut up stop

1048
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,280
arguing with me and stuff

1049
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,280
these are the steps you're going to take

1050
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,680
through medication and other types of

1051
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,720
common periods and

1052
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,240
and within

1053
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,400
a couple months so from

1054
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,320
june until about

1055
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,680
eight august

1056
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,000
i really did a full recovery and it was

1057
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,160
not easy it was a hard road and it took

1058
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,760
its toll on

1059
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,920
my marriage it's my daughter

1060
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,480
financially i just got out of that

1061
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,560
um but it

1062
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,079
i was able to get into a new

1063
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,520
organization

1064
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,480
started this in response practice and

1065
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,800
grow that from you know

1066
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,040
zero people to ten people getting me

1067
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,920
back on my feet within a couple months

1068
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,920
which felt good

1069
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,839
and it's uh

1070
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,440
you know able to get into this new

1071
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,040
product this new

1072
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,119
life and things are going great but well

1073
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,560
i think what i learned out of all this

1074
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,280
is this level of resiliency

1075
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,119
is that you can get to this you have to

1076
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,720
plan for this because

1077
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,119
you know this year has been a tough year

1078
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,079
for many ways and if i go back to that

1079
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,400
stress scale you know this year just

1080
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,079
this summer alone

1081
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,440
um

1082
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,119
my dog

1083
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,680
like debated put her dog down so he died

1084
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,440
two days later my phone was stolen in my

1085
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,839
driveway um so yeah it's pretty much

1086
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,200
john wick at that point there was a

1087
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,560
russian night club i was going to

1088
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,400
people up but i'm just i'm a little out

1089
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,480
of shape right now

1090
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,800
but yeah and then you know

1091
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,400
get a divorce so it's just like all

1092
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,240
these things compressed within a couple

1093
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,280
of weeks

1094
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,960
people like are you okay i'm like

1095
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,720
actually i am because i learned a lot of

1096
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,880
things from resilience about this and

1097
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,960
that might kind of focus on

1098
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,320
organizational resilience but it

1099
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,880
reflected easily

1100
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,720
to a certain way to

1101
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,720
my

1102
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,960
learned how to kind of

1103
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,480
be in the moment with it and not hide

1104
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,079
from it and let it build up to the point

1105
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,200
where the system crashed

1106
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,280
in reality is that what i learned out of

1107
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,880
all this is that mental illness is an

1108
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,720
illness and we really need to move past

1109
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,520
a stigma and shame that people feel

1110
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,480
about

1111
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,040
the illness and their differences

1112
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,800
because what happens is it forces people

1113
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,640
to self-medicate it forces people not to

1114
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,400
deal with these issues and they don't

1115
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,160
seek professional treatment and i

1116
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,599
probably should not treated and all the

1117
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,040
stuff was going on much earlier before

1118
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,720
things got that bad

1119
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,400
but the stadium of doing it me being a

1120
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,880
type a personality was nice got a tough

1121
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,079
now

1122
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,079
and it's stupid i mean we wouldn't tell

1123
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,240
somebody that's diabetic to suck it up

1124
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,680
right i mean

1125
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,520
tell just a smile

1126
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,079
we wouldn't use language like hey just

1127
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,920
be an insulin baby about this shut up

1128
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,440
you know we we

1129
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,040
don't have this parody of mental and

1130
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,240
physical health that we're going to be

1131
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,800
able to have so we need to look at um

1132
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,640
how people feel mentally and physically

1133
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,839
is the same

1134
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,720
aspect so we need to put this together

1135
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,240
and just go back to one of the things i

1136
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,680
was talking about earlier

1137
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,599
people said well you know is this

1138
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:30,720
uh you've been through all this so

1139
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,079
you're just being really sensitive now

1140
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,599
it's being altruistic and i said well

1141
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,520
hold on a second like i almost got

1142
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,760
knocked out of the account and now i'm

1143
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,839
back doing a lot of things making huge

1144
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,760
organizational changes for companies

1145
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,839
across the world i'm just not a person

1146
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,520
that like one of many

1147
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,040
got wiped out

1148
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,040
you know so if we don't treat each one

1149
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,160
of these

1150
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,280
issues and each one of those people

1151
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,560
right we're going to lose a lot of the

1152
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,839
people that

1153
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,760
could affect change on a larger scale

1154
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,960
and one of the things i started looking

1155
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,280
at is when i built out that practice in

1156
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,240
2016 i was really focused on

1157
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,880
the health of my professionals now i'm

1158
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,280
starting a new office in denver with

1159
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,359
very high utilization targets

1160
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,359
and i took in a bunch of things i said

1161
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,480
okay look

1162
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,119
at this more realistic how can i make

1163
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,400
sure these people

1164
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,400
aren't resilient and maintain their

1165
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,960
ability to be high output performance in

1166
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,680
this

1167
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,040
and i was able to do is really able to

1168
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,400
build a team

1169
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,000
that balanced

1170
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
time up they looked after each other and

1171
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,839
what we ended up with were

1172
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,320
people that were happier and healthier

1173
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,480
they were staying in the game longer

1174
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,880
and i ended up with happier customers

1175
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,440
higher top line revenues higher profit

1176
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,560
margins

1177
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,079
we didn't have to redo work constantly

1178
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,680
our customer satisfaction was higher my

1179
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,760
retention rate was higher every employee

1180
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,160
survey was higher so when i realized

1181
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,160
it's not the zero-sum gain we don't have

1182
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,640
to treat mental health as this

1183
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,920
thing we don't want to deal with in the

1184
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,280
business because if we do it's going to

1185
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,359
cost us money if you don't deal with it

1186
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:00,880
it's going to cost you far more so we

1187
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,240
have to look at things like mental

1188
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,400
health as something that isn't bit into

1189
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,400
the way that we do business

1190
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,240
again this reality is that pain is

1191
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,160
inevitable to suffer this often i can't

1192
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,880
sit there and let people

1193
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,760
go through this and not

1194
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,119
deal with things so that's some of the

1195
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,440
things that i'm trying to work on and

1196
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,560
look at what are some of

1197
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,400
within the mental health community

1198
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,839
there's specific things that we'll talk

1199
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,119
about

1200
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,800
treatment outside of self-care which

1201
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,000
we'll talk about in a second you know

1202
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,160
there's things that i use um i'm not

1203
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,920
afraid to talk about those medications

1204
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,240
like lexico i got my mother recently had

1205
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,040
an ssri because she was having issues

1206
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,880
and that's like you know 83 years old

1207
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,920
you're going through life change should

1208
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,599
not come along

1209
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,079
talk to somebody get some medication so

1210
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,359
there's different types of therapy that

1211
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,040
work for everybody for me what work was

1212
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,200
accepted as a training therapy or act

1213
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,960
and it's this evolution of cognitive

1214
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,240
behavior therapy that worked really well

1215
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,599
for me because

1216
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,200
really what i learned out of that and

1217
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,640
why it's been able to orient me to the

1218
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,720
summer of doing things is

1219
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,200
really stop avoiding and denying

1220
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,119
um with your inner emotions and this

1221
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,079
idea is acceptance that i have these

1222
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,839
issues they can't be fixed nor should i

1223
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,839
try to fix them because that was the

1224
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,760
struggle i was constantly struggling

1225
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,359
every day to

1226
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,040
fix my mental health issues instead of

1227
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,119
just management

1228
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,560
once they learned how to manage it it

1229
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,800
was much easier i stopped fighting it

1230
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,240
constantly

1231
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,400
and that's how everyone can really get

1232
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,920
through a lot of this

1233
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,640
and

1234
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,839
some of the other things i've done is

1235
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:34,319
along the ideas of self-care and this

1236
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:35,760
idea but there were things i could do

1237
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,160
that i could literally put into my

1238
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,240
operating system cycles that are going

1239
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,400
to maintain my health and prevent and

1240
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,480
deal with long-term moments

1241
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,240
and so this is going to be think of

1242
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,839
self-care as this kind of proactive and

1243
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,920
preventative steps that you do at work

1244
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,440
whether it's vulnerability research and

1245
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,520
management threat hunting patching

1246
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,800
funnels whatever it is that you're doing

1247
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,160
to get ahead

1248
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,720
of issues proactively and so there's

1249
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,480
different things that you can do

1250
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,240
it really kind of helps regulate your

1251
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,800
dopamine and serotonin and these are

1252
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,720
really the two most popular balanced out

1253
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,319
neurotransmitters that help regulate

1254
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:09,760
moving well-being

1255
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,200
and so serotonin does a variety of

1256
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,040
things in the body that's

1257
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,520
really unknown exactly why

1258
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,520
levels are so tied to

1259
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,760
mental illness but the basis is a

1260
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,079
regulation effect because it really has

1261
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,319
balance throughout all functions in your

1262
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,319
body particularly mental health through

1263
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:27,839
the way that you

1264
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,920
digest food and it's really a strong

1265
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,000
regulator the dopamine is this feel good

1266
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,200
transmitter

1267
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,720
it's what the brain releases when eating

1268
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,680
food

1269
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,359
or

1270
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,839
meat food that you create we have sex

1271
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,440
uh contributes to

1272
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,119
pleasures feelings of pleasure and

1273
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:44,720
satisfaction

1274
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,560
as part of this reward system

1275
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,160
so it's a really important neural

1276
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,240
chemical and a boost movement of

1277
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,240
motivation

1278
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,599
so

1279
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:55,200
this idea of how do you kind of balance

1280
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,119
out your serotonin and dopamine ahead of

1281
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,359
time before things get unregulated

1282
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:00,640
and there's a lot of things you can do

1283
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,160
and some of the things that i encourage

1284
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,000
people to do is

1285
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,319
um take you know all these things you

1286
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,000
know some things that are worth me and

1287
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,960
stuff is sort of is reducing fatigue you

1288
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,280
know on this phone i don't have people

1289
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,800
nobody believes me but i don't have work

1290
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,880
email i don't have slack

1291
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,480
on the weekends that take off twitter

1292
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,920
right it's really hard to get ahold of

1293
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,119
me individually

1294
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,599
actually a couple of businesses

1295
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,400
you take all this stuff off

1296
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:40,480
because i found myself being very

1297
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,800
reactive i'm the best kind of woman so i

1298
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,079
took off a lot of those things that

1299
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,720
would cause distractions or words that

1300
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,240
raises levels of anxiety in my body

1301
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,839
and managing that

1302
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,599
also there's other things like you know

1303
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,200
calling a friend just writing to a

1304
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,880
friend making those human connections

1305
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,240
that's been really hard for a lot of

1306
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,319
people this is one of the hardest parts

1307
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,000
of the last 18 months of people doing

1308
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,839
the self-care management

1309
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,040
and really

1310
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,400
toxic uh kind of environment

1311
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,480
whatever level of connection you have to

1312
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,400
make please do because that's really one

1313
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,440
of the most important things

1314
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:20,800
in regulating a lot of these things

1315
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,079
the other parts really simple things

1316
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,240
like exercise getting out there's

1317
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,400
walking you know you can start small you

1318
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,240
don't have to go and do any kind of

1319
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,440
crazy

1320
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,880
shame routine just getting out there and

1321
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,040
getting outside the environment

1322
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:33,839
and

1323
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,359
what i found particularly in the last

1324
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:37,359
year is commuting home now i work at

1325
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:39,280
home so how to do that because i would

1326
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,640
put everything down my office close the

1327
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,480
door and i walk out and then go for a

1328
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,920
walk around the neighborhood and never

1329
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,240
come and at that point i've

1330
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,520
put everything behind me when i entered

1331
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,040
the

1332
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,599
and touch the house

1333
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,079
but it's this way of just getting away

1334
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,480
from things adding some exercise allows

1335
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,160
me to decompress

1336
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,319
this little breaks and time management

1337
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,000
and boundaries that become

1338
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,520
uh incredibly important and what else

1339
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,359
about this here is as much as i like

1340
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,720
going out and drinking and doing stuff

1341
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,000
because i really had to focus on

1342
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,560
alternatives um because early on at the

1343
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,599
economics problem we saw our wine bills

1344
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,720
go through the roof um

1345
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,319
i was like this is not a sustainable

1346
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:19,119
long-term financial

1347
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,119
because that's one of the dangers of

1348
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,119
self-care is you can really kind of fall

1349
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,800
into base self-care

1350
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,680
of dying uh going from one stream to

1351
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,720
another

1352
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,839
um

1353
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:41,359
saying bad things about yourself i found

1354
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:43,520
myself doing that early on thinking okay

1355
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,200
i have to motivate myself i should talk

1356
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,560
to myself um and it's a really hard trap

1357
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,720
upon where many people kind of really

1358
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,240
beat yourself up and do the things that

1359
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,800
are not true self-care things

1360
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,839
so really try to focus on what what is

1361
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,520
important out of the size you know it's

1362
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,960
just getting away from the fake

1363
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,400
self-care you're not going to miss out

1364
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,920
things by

1365
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,599
not being you know rushing out and i

1366
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,839
think the photo thing is so important so

1367
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,359
it was like i'll have to go if

1368
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:12,800
somebody's doing something loud meet

1369
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,359
them and do this and really not spend

1370
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:16,400
the right time with my daughter or

1371
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,839
something like that so it's really easy

1372
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:20,480
to displace those efforts in the wrong

1373
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,640
areas and really not

1374
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,800
take the self-care steps that you need

1375
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,480
and some people say do you really need

1376
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,280
it can you do it there's a lot of myths

1377
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,119
about self-care that is selfish or

1378
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:33,520
really basic in your life but it's not

1379
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,000
quite frankly deserved like i said we

1380
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,400
feel better we treat better and treat

1381
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,640
others better and work better

1382
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,319
and some of the stuff we really have to

1383
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:43,359
do for

1384
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:44,640
some of these self-care steps like i

1385
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,240
said just pick out three good for 21

1386
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,720
days it takes 21 days to develop good

1387
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,200
habits on average or break them so do it

1388
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,800
for a couple weeks it's not a big ass

1389
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,920
try to go through some of these things

1390
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,440
and start managing your stress better in

1391
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,200
your life but then understand that this

1392
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,440
needs to be a lot of moral practice

1393
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,720
you know some of the things that i

1394
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,839
really kind of want to leave you with

1395
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:03,200
and wrap up

1396
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,240
is that you know again you deserve this

1397
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,160
that you deserve this life

1398
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,000
don't think that any moment you're

1399
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,079
you're not worth what you are

1400
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,200
um and ultimately treat others well

1401
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,319
because you never know what somebody

1402
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:18,800
else is going through and robin williams

1403
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,760
unfortunately did pass away from suicide

1404
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,599
has this great quote you know everybody

1405
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:25,760
needs by battling nothing about and

1406
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,440
that's so true

1407
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,280
just take a moment to be nicer to people

1408
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,880
and that's hard for me because i like

1409
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,079
tell people when they're wrong and i

1410
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,000
think a lot of times they might not know

1411
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,480
that they need to tell them

1412
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,920
so it's really that people look like

1413
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,680
unsolicited criticism

1414
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,839
but i really have to change that in my

1415
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:43,680
behavior dramatically particularly last

1416
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,440
year because i realized people have been

1417
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,480
more

1418
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,800
on edge their nerves are burned out and

1419
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,240
i just don't know what else is going on

1420
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,640
in life i just need to step back and i

1421
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,319
really that was one lesson

1422
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:57,839
last year and we all do and

1423
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,599
warren buffett

1424
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,000
framed it the way he's talking

1425
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,440
um

1426
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,119
he said one of the best pieces of advice

1427
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,880
he got from his friend thomas murphy he

1428
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:07,599
said

1429
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:09,280
if thomas is a reward you can always

1430
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,760
tell something about helen

1431
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,760
which is just an easy way of putting it

1432
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,119
right you know

1433
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:16,880
if they really need to be told off put

1434
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,640
it down for a day and come back if they

1435
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,040
really need to but then you can tell

1436
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,160
them about that but if you don't have to

1437
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,160
do anything because this idea of stop

1438
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,000
being reactive and i talked about that

1439
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,599
and we went into the response work all

1440
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,440
the time this instant response that is a

1441
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,599
reaction you gotta do the same thing

1442
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:34,160
with what we do so just slow your roll

1443
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,559
and do what goblin does

1444
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:39,280
just look nice

1445
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:41,920
and ultimately it's because you don't

1446
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,520
make time for your wellness you will be

1447
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,680
forced to take time for yourself

1448
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,599
so by treating yourself right making

1449
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:50,079
sure what you're doing is

1450
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,319
feel self-validated you feel that you're

1451
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,720
worth it um you'll feel better i would

1452
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,079
encourage everybody to do this if you

1453
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:56,960
could

1454
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,119
tonight

1455
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:02,119
um

1456
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,559
you know really kind of

1457
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,079
you know continue to

1458
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,520
support each other

1459
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,839
um

1460
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:16,400
and one way to support yourself is

1461
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,559
tonight

1462
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,000
we're going to get back to your house

1463
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,520
and it's not going to tonight or every

1464
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,520
monday or something take out like a

1465
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,920
written piece of paper

1466
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,520
telephone or anything else and just

1467
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,880
write down five good things about

1468
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,640
yourself when you wake up the next day

1469
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,839
because i put the piece of paper with

1470
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:33,839
the pen there you wake up in the morning

1471
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,680
and that's

1472
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,559
surprisingly hard to do and people are

1473
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,480
so self-critical if you sit there what

1474
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,640
are five good things about yourself and

1475
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,880
try to do that one more thing the next

1476
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,880
week you'll find how incredibly hard it

1477
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,440
is but how incredibly powerful it is for

1478
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,720
you to be able to think about yourself

1479
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,040
and better lives and how the

1480
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,200
frame seems to treat others better

1481
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,079
because you really have to kind of

1482
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:57,839
support each other if we're going to

1483
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:00,240
continue to have the plan

1484
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,200
so

1485
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,880
really take some time to look into some

1486
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,960
of these issues uh feel free to reach

1487
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,880
out to me if you know others that are

1488
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,720
struggling you know there's a lot of

1489
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,480
crisis centered stuff that i have a new

1490
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,480
level of mental health hackers

1491
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,480
organization definitely check them out

1492
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,000
check out the neurodiversity groups

1493
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,280
inside your organization if you're

1494
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,280
looking to start one i have a ton of

1495
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,880
resources on that we've done really well

1496
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,960
explode with that i have people that are

1497
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,160
willing to reach out and help your

1498
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,720
organization start that so with that

1499
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:31,399
have a great day take care of each other
