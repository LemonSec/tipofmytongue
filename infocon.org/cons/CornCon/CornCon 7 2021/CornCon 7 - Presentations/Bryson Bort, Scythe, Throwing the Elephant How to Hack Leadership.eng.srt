23
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,719
all right so disclaimer

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,879
this presentation upsets you it's your

25
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,120
 problem not mine i'm doing my

26
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,960
job we're going to talk through some

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,199
hard truths about the fact that who here

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,160
works in security

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,000
who feels sad about that

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,119
if you're being honest to keep your

31
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,400
hands upright

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,560
here's the problem

33
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,720
nobody cares

34
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,560
nobody cares that you work in security

35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,000
i'm sure most of you when you go to the

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,600
polite little parties

37
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,000
and somebody's like hey what do you do

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,080
you're like i work with computers

39
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,680
they're like okay and they already zoned

40
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,280
out because once you say security

41
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,880
they're like what the does that

42
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,079
mean

43
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,240
right nobody cares the cavalry is not

44
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,280
coming

45
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,880
and we're going to talk through the why

46
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,000
right we're going to have some hard

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,520
truths about why we are where we are

48
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,640
and what we can do about it

49
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,840
the elephant

50
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,520
i mean that had to show up right

51
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,640
throwing the elephant let's call the

52
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,799
elephant in the room

53
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,840
what's the problem with elephants

54
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,040
they're destructive they're destructive

55
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,000
right

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,280
elephants go to trample where an

57
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,640
elephant's gonna trample if i feel like

58
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,280
going over here

59
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,840
what are you gonna do to stop it

60
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,520
not much except for not trying to get

61
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,799
trampled right what else

62
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,800
what else the elephants do

63
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,400
it's not a trick question it's to talk

64
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,920
about an actual animal that i believe

65
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,840
you've mostly seen in the zoo

66
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,959
if you leave your basement get outside

67
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,319
what do elephants do what are some

68
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,879
characteristics of elephants

69
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,200
they have the best memory

70
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,959
fortunately that metaphor does not work

71
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,480
for what i'm doing with this but thank

72
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,640
you thanks for participating

73
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,200
that is absolutely correct but

74
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,400
i didn't expect somebody to give me a

75
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,480
good one

76
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,800
they spout water right

77
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,360
what happens when the elephant goes to

78
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,200
the bathroom

79
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,040
there's a lot of

80
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,840
right

81
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,080
they're big they trample things they

82
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,720
leave messes they do what they want to

83
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,720
do

84
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,200
you might have an opinion about it

85
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,040
but what's it like talking to an

86
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,840
elephant

87
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,200
so

88
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,000
what's my point here

89
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,760
the elephant's your boss

90
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,239
anybody have a boss that really feels

91
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,480
like that elephant

92
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,280
yeah

93
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,879
give me a story where's the time you had

94
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,080
to clean up a bunch of after your

95
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,319
boss

96
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,720
can you plead the fifth

97
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,239
he's to watch the recording or she's

98
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,599
going to watch the authority from people

99
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,480
here

100
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,640
okay it's your boss in the room yeah put

101
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,958
him out

102
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,760
so your boss is the elephant all of

103
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,280
those physical characteristics we just

104
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,959
described by an elephant

105
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,400
is your boss

106
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,159
or if your boss is awesome it's their

107
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,239
boss right bosses are elephants

108
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,480
management hierarchy

109
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,959
so the inspiration i got for this talk

110
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,879
was um

111
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,200
i got i lived in florida

112
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,720
and i got divorced

113
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,120
is divorced cheap or expensive

114
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,040
okay it's expensive do you know why it's

115
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,640
expensive

116
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,599
because it's worth it

117
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,798
but i was broke

118
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,720
so humor aside and a whole lot of

119
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,560
drinking i needed to make some more

120
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,720
money and i got recruited up to

121
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,240
washington dc

122
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,199
um by uh this vice president

123
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,680
and my job was um

124
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,320
uh in in that group uh we ran the

125
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,840
infrastructure refresh for the

126
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,080
department of state defense intelligence

127
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,360
agency and um special forces in africa

128
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,280
so all the infrastructure there we were

129
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,880
responsible for the configuration

130
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,960
provisioning getting it over to wherever

131
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,160
it was around the world for all the

132
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,680
consulates all the embassies all of

133
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,040
those locations and making sure that it

134
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,600
was secure and was put in place

135
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,560
and so he hired me in because what he

136
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,919
didn't quite know but he sort of had a

137
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,440
sense that he needed somebody like me

138
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,120
but the problem was he wasn't in charge

139
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,479
he was one of those people who had big

140
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,320
ideas and all the people that worked for

141
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,919
him was like

142
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,000
we do whatever we want and so i was the

143
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,440
guy brought in essentially to be that

144
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,840
change agent to make things

145
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,080
be a little more aligned and efficient

146
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,800
well that requires the guy at the top to

147
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,240
actually you know

148
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,720
be around

149
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,520
i showed up on day one and i didn't see

150
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,520
the guy for weeks so i just kind of sat

151
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,039
at my office and like wandered around

152
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,800
because i'm like what what am i gonna do

153
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,800
to create change in this organization

154
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,039
when my executive sponsor won't even

155
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,840
like talk to

156
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,840
me so i went and did some things and i i

157
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,000
was getting frustrated right

158
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,600
this isn't even security right this is

159
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,080
just simple human 101 management 101.

160
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,120
and i could not find the guy

161
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,840
so i found this book called throwing the

162
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,120
elephant and we're going to talk through

163
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,720
some of the principles that i went

164
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,800
through painfully and personally we're

165
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,639
going to tie them back into some things

166
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,319
that we can do so there is going to be

167
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,919
for for the nerds in the room we're like

168
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,080
i thought this was a technical talk

169
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,960
too bad for you there is some stuff but

170
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,080
we're going to talk about a lot of the

171
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,440
things that are going to help you get

172
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,600
where you get to do the fun stuff

173
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,759
because the technical stuff is fun

174
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,160
it's the people stuff that sucks

175
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,360
so we're going to talk about some of

176
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,479
that people stuff and then go into that

177
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,639
all right so back on the fact that the

178
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,240
elephant is your boss or their boss

179
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,000
the problem is this is how the boss sees

180
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,240
themselves right

181
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,360
do you remember

182
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,280
the boss the first time right now we see

183
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,400
the

184
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,599
the bosses view themselves

185
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,560
they have an ego

186
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,160
they don't think they're doing anything

187
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,800
wrong they are wonderful awesome people

188
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,039
just ask them

189
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,599
so now we're going to turn this into

190
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,120
where your boss fits in the hierarchy of

191
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,800
the entire company

192
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,599
so

193
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,319
your boss she's awesome right as much as

194
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,240
you have some issues or whatever she's

195
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,759
actually she's a good person right she

196
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,199
works with you in the trenches in

197
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,880
security

198
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,840
right she's a sock manager

199
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,800
she's a

200
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
analyst team lead

201
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
but where does security fit in the

202
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,440
organization

203
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,840
foreshadowing we went to the bottom of

204
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,919
the slide

205
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,120
so

206
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,599
above security

207
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,080
is information technology

208
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,759
above information technology is the

209
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,199
business

210
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,639
and then of course the leadership for

211
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,440
the overall business

212
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,800
what's the takeaway from this slide

213
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,479
other than apparently i used mr bean for

214
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,199
everything idiot

215
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,039
johnny made eye contact

216
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,560
i would say if i want a promotion to put

217
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,039
a q-tip in mine here knows

218
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,039
that's code testing

219
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,479
what does this hierarchy represent

220
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,080
where's the what where the poop's gonna

221
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,599
fall that's true right goes

222
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,639
downhill never goes up

223
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,720
it puts security under the auspices of

224
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,280
who they're supposed to be patrolling

225
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,080
puts security under the auspices of who

226
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,639
they are supposed to be controlling

227
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,720
security controls people that's wrong

228
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,840
they're supposed to be supposed to okay

229
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,759
so

230
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,479
what is the purpose of a business

231
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,000
make money to make money

232
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,919
how many businesses are we talking in

233
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,840
this scenario right or

234
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,958
is security how they make money

235
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:35,919
yeah

236
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,320
right very few there are security

237
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,839
organizations out there and you ever

238
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,440
want to see the toddler doesn't have you

239
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,360
know kids doesn't have their own shoes

240
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,320
they never even follow their own

241
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,760
security guidance

242
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,080
um you know let's see uh i think it was

243
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,320
accenture lately that he got hacked

244
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,760
i mean we could just keep throwing booze

245
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,200
out of hamilton on the bus all day long

246
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,880
thank you snowden

247
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,360
i'm trying to be i'll be here all week

248
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,240
um so the purpose of the business is not

249
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,839
security

250
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,360
the purpose of the business is to make

251
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,519
money for a purpose

252
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,959
if i make cookies that's what we do we

253
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,200
make cookies that's how we make money to

254
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,839
be a modern business making cookies i

255
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,720
need information technology to scale

256
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,519
what percentage of the budget goes you

257
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,680
know is relative between making those

258
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,399
cookies and just the i.t component

259
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,920
right it varies from industry to

260
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,200
industry but i think you're gonna be

261
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,880
looking at anywhere from five percent

262
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,240
plus or minus

263
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,320
one twentieth of the expenditure the

264
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,880
revenue the budget for that company is

265
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,279
going to information technology

266
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,600
okay

267
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,480
next

268
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,360
security what percentage of that budget

269
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,320
right

270
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,519
and then when you start thinking about

271
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,839
right so you start breaking these down

272
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,920
where do we fit

273
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,800
we are resource wise at the bottom

274
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,279
we are priority wise at the bottom and

275
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,800
we haven't even gotten to the point yet

276
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,560
they were talking to people that think

277
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,720
that the cd realms that in the old days

278
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,360
were where you had the coffee

279
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,320
right

280
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,839
if there's one thing we've accomplished

281
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,480
in it over decades is that we now have

282
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,079
every user trained to turn it off and

283
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,160
turn it back on again before bugging us

284
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,120
that is the only thing we've

285
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,200
accomplished

286
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
it's a way because it fixes 50 of their

287
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,360
problems right so that's not a bad thing

288
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,279
but that's it you know hold on to that

289
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,200
put that up on a plaque and congratulate

290
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,480
ourselves good job us

291
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,800
all right

292
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,760
so

293
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,000
room question what percentage of boards

294
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,959
have a dedicated committee for cyber

295
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,120
[Music]

296
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,320
because i should put a security i want

297
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,200
to come out to the audience

298
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,720
i like that i saw where i was going all

299
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,920
right

300
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,560
i'm just a cause i'm a pessimist you're

301
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,600
a passive

302
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,880
you work in security of course you're

303
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,279
pessimistic

304
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,040
i was also going to say hey

305
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,760
you're chicken

306
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,480
lemon white

307
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,519
bee

308
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,560
b

309
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,120
he says b 10 to 25 all right so you're

310
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,560
kind of like halfway because you're like

311
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,000
well i remember i did that one i'm just

312
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,320
going jason does anybody think higher

313
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,920
than b

314
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,200
no nobody

315
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,519
john

316
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,920
you know what i'll go higher but they're

317
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,600
not funded and nobody listens to them

318
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,279
and it's just lip service to check them

319
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,079
out

320
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:40,880
again

321
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,880
i'm gonna go higher than b

322
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,360
but only to pay lip service and check a

323
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,040
box to say they're compliant but they

324
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,320
don't get any money and they'll be

325
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,920
listed

326
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,800
okay

327
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,600
so

328
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
we think there are a greater percentage

329
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,880
that have a dedicated committee for

330
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,639
cyber security at the

331
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,920
um typically it's going to be the board

332
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,000
level just a figure but they're not

333
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,120
funded

334
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,279
nobody listens to it okay nobody listens

335
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,680
all right so the answer is of course

336
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,560
less than ten percent it's actually nine

337
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,920
so first thing i'm going to point out

338
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,120
that

339
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,399
break your arm off get yourself on the

340
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,639
bench

341
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,959
you notice here at the bottom

342
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,760
um i put references to everything that i

343
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,399
say any source anything i steal i don't

344
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,800
steal it i share it and i make sure that

345
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,240
i have that so i'm pretty sure the

346
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,600
presentation slides will be available

347
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,279
afterward

348
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,519
you ever want to go in further detail oh

349
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,720
yeah the cyber things guy said it is

350
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,240
stranger things sorry

351
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,279
oh it does say yes it does

352
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,839
my site still works

353
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,279
seriously

354
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,720
it's got short range so you stay on

355
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,959
stage is it ir

356
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,920
there you go there you go

357
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,200
i think it's telling me i should go back

358
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,040
up on stage

359
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,760
 remote

360
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,480
i have a second mic i can wander how do

361
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,279
you really

362
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,200
but better yeah i didn't know i was

363
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,519
going to give her a camera okay

364
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,519
not that i need one

365
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,399
all right

366
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,760
how many businesses are there in the

367
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,399
united states

368
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,880
throw them out

369
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,160
a ton

370
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,440
one metric ton of business

371
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,040
two all right so how many

372
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,880
businesses are there 10 million 10

373
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,680
million higher lower anybody

374
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,720
higher

375
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,959
way higher yeah higher

376
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,680
use numbers

377
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,519
no i'm afraid i need to quantify

378
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,320
there are more businesses than there are

379
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,279
people right yeah

380
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,839
can run multiple businesses that's true

381
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,199
and they're shell companies and i mean

382
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,720
okay

383
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,920
i actually have three

384
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,240
if you remember on the bio i actually

385
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,560
listed them

386
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,120
all right so between 10 million and 501

387
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,160
million

388
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,839
the answer is there are 32 and a half

389
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:24,639
million

390
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,240
businesses there's the reference at the

391
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,760
bottom

392
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,560
that was below so

393
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,240
well so it was kind of a trick question

394
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,600
on that because i said a dedicated

395
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
committee sometimes risk is handled at

396
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,199
the risk management level or cyber

397
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,959
security is embedded inside risk

398
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,000
management

399
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,600
so it was kind of a trick question about

400
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,000
it being a dedicated committee but

401
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,440
what do you mean by that most of these

402
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,120
businesses don't even have committees

403
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,800
actually but i'm willing to say 25 25 so

404
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,519
25 percent is about 8 million

405
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,440
okay

406
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,680
what do you mean 20 23 23 million no 23

407
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,000
oh just 23.

408
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,600
well if we're going that way the answer

409
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,399
the real answer is zero

410
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,519
what do you mean by security

411
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,680
hence my joke about zero

412
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,160
um so how i came up with this statistic

413
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,399
is um i actually looked and uh the

414
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,480
the references that uh

415
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,480
60 percent um have uh a invest in

416
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,720
security like actually pay for security

417
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,199
so it was a very low bar and then this

418
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,560
is something i always like to do at the

419
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,880
hacker conferences i don't this is a new

420
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,560
slide but the the bottom part is the

421
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,199
statistic i've used before which is how

422
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,079
many of them have a red team

423
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,160
23.

424
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,480
that's actually pretty close right

425
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,079
can you see it you see where it fits

426
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,680
relative right

427
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,399
there i mean there is a very small

428
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,440
percentage so this is uh out of this

429
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,800
presentation which is one of the things

430
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,399
i would castigate this industry where we

431
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,240
have experts come up here and i'm not an

432
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,120
expert but come up here and talk

433
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,199
they are addressing the top of the top

434
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,279
percent in all of the ideas they got

435
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,199
most talks address that percentage

436
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,959
this is the world

437
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,360
this is the world we actually live in

438
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,720
there are a few of us who are privileged

439
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,959
to work at companies that have the

440
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,680
budgets of small countries

441
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,440
and finance

442
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,880
the rest of us don't

443
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,240
i have gone

444
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,000
across multiple industries i have been

445
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
at some of the largest manufacturers and

446
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,920
what they're given right it's like

447
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,839
a rounding error for what i see

448
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,560
elsewhere and these are large listed

449
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,839
companies right fortune 500 fortune 200.

450
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,079
okay so the rules of the serengeti are

451
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,399
going back into the elephant metaphor

452
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,839
despite the fact the elephant has good

453
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,240
memory your boss doesn't

454
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,559
so the rules are there are two kinds of

455
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,280
village cheats

456
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,959
your leadership cares about security

457
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,559
your leadership doesn't care about

458
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,039
security

459
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,640
there are no amount of heroics awesome

460
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,559
sauce tooling or anything you can do

461
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,640
that can get past that point if you

462
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,319
cannot convince the leadership that what

463
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,439
you do

464
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,839
matters

465
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,559
it doesn't matter it doesn't matter

466
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,000
and it's why you're sad every morning

467
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,640
and you cry in your weeds

468
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,160
don't be sad

469
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,400
change jobs or fix your leadership

470
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,640
right

471
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,840
okay so maslow's hierarchy i adapted

472
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,280
this but i think you can get the point

473
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,120
where i was putting the the hierarchy of

474
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,200
things but in the village the hierarchy

475
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,160
is

476
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,760
i need water then i need food then i

477
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,960
need shelter and then i need to be able

478
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,480
to secure my village

479
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,120
kind of looks like the same thing we saw

480
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,679
when we put the priorities of where our

481
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,600
boss fit in the hierarchy up to business

482
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,280
and leadership

483
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,559
huh

484
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,039
so a micro and macro insight into

485
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,360
psychology of organization management

486
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,200
this is where we fit these are the rules

487
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,480
of the serengeti

488
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,960
and they are immutable

489
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,080
you can't change that order

490
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,480
you can't create more budget that's

491
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,360
above the budget that's available

492
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,520
you can't get more interest than above

493
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,720
the interest that's above you

494
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,600
because we're a cost center right

495
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,000
we might support

496
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,039
assuring that profit continues

497
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,480
we do not generate profit

498
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,480
we're not alone in that

499
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,640
imagine being like imagine working in hr

500
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,080
they do it

501
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,559
people do it apparently but that's what

502
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,000
they face too right so just giving an

503
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,919
example like we're not the only ones on

504
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,600
this part of the chain

505
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,039
but we don't care about that we only

506
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,240
care about ourselves right now so

507
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,720
all right so convincing the elephant

508
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,559
okay

509
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,799
all right so there's three directions of

510
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,160
management

511
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,080
manage up manage your boss

512
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,240
manage sideways work with your peers

513
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,520
and then the one that typically

514
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,799
everybody of course understands and

515
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,160
thinks about is managing down because

516
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,400
it's easy on the boss do these things

517
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,480
but there's three levels of management

518
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,960
it's not just you managing your team

519
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,960
it's working with your other peers to

520
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,880
accomplish things and of course throwing

521
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,799
the elephant how do we get the boss

522
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,880
above us

523
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,200
to do what we want

524
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,480
so some of the ideas just on the

525
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,600
sideways we're going to go through each

526
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,559
three of these but um is the

527
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,240
kind of an asterisk part which is what i

528
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,480
call the security champion program

529
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,240
so peers are other folks in our

530
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,440
organization

531
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,840
security champion is the idea that we

532
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,520
can co-opt

533
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,799
folks in other villages in the

534
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,440
organization to support our goals right

535
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,120
i'm not just working with this team and

536
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,720
this team lead that you know i see it at

537
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,000
the other basis

538
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,240
but i'm going cross-functional outside

539
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,000
of security to do it and we're going to

540
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
go with some detail about that

541
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,080
okay so convincing the elephant

542
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,520
big lumbering beast

543
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,120
the important thing is

544
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,440
where are they coming from and you can

545
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,000
see i overemphasize that

546
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,720
so how do you find this out

547
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,640
how do you answer what there is

548
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,600
you ask them

549
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,960
isn't that weird

550
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,880
you can actually ask people things and

551
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,360
they will give you answers it's

552
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,960
 phenomenal

553
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,559
but then what

554
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,960
what do you have to do

555
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,840
listen

556
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,039
a lot of times in our space we're really

557
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,200
fond of we're thinking we have a

558
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,400
dialogue

559
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,080
and mostly what we're doing is just

560
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,559
trying to get to some tactical point

561
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,919
we don't communicate we talk

562
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,080
right active listening understanding

563
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,520
iterating through asking getting

564
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,280
something and double checking and asking

565
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,520
and building on that you will get all of

566
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,120
those components of what the elephant

567
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,000
wants

568
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,240
because that's a great starting point

569
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,720
i was an army officer i didn't just go

570
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,480
into the battlefield i was given an

571
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,559
intelligence preparation brief that said

572
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,799
this is what the situation was we need

573
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,480
to show the guns go okay we're going

574
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,000
that way right why would you do that

575
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
with your boss

576
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,360
if you're trying to do something

577
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,520
understand who you're working with

578
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,039
okay

579
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,640
what does your village do right your

580
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,159
boss and you work in this village

581
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,520
first job i had when i got out of the

582
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,440
army um

583
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,960
and i promise everything i say is not

584
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,280
exaggerated these are 100 true in the

585
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,120
job interview i told them i didn't even

586
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,200
know what the title meant

587
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,799
and they hired me

588
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,480
i was a global commodity manager in

589
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,480
supply chain management

590
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,640
yeah i didn't know what that meant

591
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,320
so they're you're hired

592
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,440
okay

593
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,400
what do i do yeah you'll figure it out

594
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,120
two months later i just got fired

595
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,200
but the thing that i found interesting

596
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,360
so i did that job for about a year and

597
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,799
this at the time i really just wanted to

598
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,320
get out of i.t like all of us i'm like

599
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,280
yes for this computer suck um and then i

600
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,960
you know i went and spent a year doing

601
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,559
that and it was like this isn't hard

602
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,640
and a position opened up for me to be a

603
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,240
global i.t configuration manager and

604
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,640
build an entire department from scratch

605
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,360
and

606
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,760
staff establish process across this

607
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,520
multinational manufacturing company and

608
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,679
create a cmdb configuration management

609
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:42,799
database

610
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,720
i actually created a fully fleshed cmdb

611
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,320
from scratch and populated it with

612
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,320
processes to keep it in line

613
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,960
i'm impressed

614
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,039
that's actually a talk i've been asked

615
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,440
to give because for a long time true

616
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,280
story as i'm up here bearing my soul is

617
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,799
i was ashamed that i'd done that because

618
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,480
i'm in the hacker community and i

619
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,760
figured people would think less of me

620
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,200
because i was i built a cmdb

621
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,039
you know what's funny what is 80 of

622
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,000
security is configuration management

623
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,960
what do i got what's the state

624
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,760
so

625
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,760
point west so i'm there now in the it

626
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,559
organization again and i was shocked

627
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,480
nobody in the it organization knew what

628
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,120
the company did i did because i actually

629
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,880
worked the manufacturing side i worked

630
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,320
the suppliers like i walked to the

631
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,159
floors i went to the facilities and saw

632
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,840
how we built everything we built i was a

633
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,559
part of that nobody in i.t had any clue

634
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,240
like i don't know like airplanes or

635
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,159
something

636
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,240
have you ever like talked to like the

637
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,919
engineering manager like who sits you

638
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:40,640
know

639
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,159
two doors down

640
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,320
no

641
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,080
but he really pisses me off that he

642
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,240
doesn't do what i ask

643
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,039
huh

644
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,679
but you don't know what he does

645
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,520
so understand your village and there's

646
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,720
lots of ways to understand the village

647
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,799
so like i said walk the floor there's no

648
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,039
reason in you know this is assuming you

649
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,480
can actually have physical access to the

650
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,480
office and the the coca times but

651
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,080
there's no reason that you shouldn't

652
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,080
walk the floor and go meet other folks

653
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,440
that are outside of information

654
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,679
technology outside of security

655
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,360
learn what your village does in the

656
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,320
example we said earlier about the

657
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,760
cookies go eat some cookies

658
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,919
put on some ppe and walk the floor and

659
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,520
see the cookies coming out

660
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,360
ask some random folks about it why not

661
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,080
what's stopping you

662
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,960
[Music]

663
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,279
and then reading so

664
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,039
did you know that if you're a public

665
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,120
company they're required to produce

666
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,400
details about everything they're doing

667
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,960
and it's available for you to read

668
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,520
they tell you what's important to them

669
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,840
you actually if you want to see you know

670
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,200
where your leadership thinks of cyber

671
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,880
security they will list it on that

672
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,799
report they will say this is the ranking

673
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,720
where cyber security is important to us

674
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,720
or another giveaway is you don't see it

675
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,279
in the report

676
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,960
but they tell you

677
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,919
they have to go look it up read it go to

678
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,320
investor briefings listen to your ceo's

679
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,240
work

680
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,000
laugh at them

681
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,279
and then realize you work for them

682
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,200
news articles because of course your

683
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,720
stuff produces the news and then this is

684
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,480
a hap tip to uh jacob williams and

685
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,039
albert jake um that he gave me the idea

686
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,080
of

687
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,000
all of these executives have nba reading

688
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,600
books right they all have this mba list

689
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,960
of i'm bringing you know from good to

690
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,480
great or you know whatever that is in

691
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,760
fact throwing the elephants probably on

692
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,360
that list like that

693
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,960
you'll learn their language

694
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,000
right

695
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,600
you might not be an exact but who are

696
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,080
you trying to sell and convince

697
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,679
an executive

698
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:38,799
what's the language and what's their

699
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:43,080
mantra well they read books for them

700
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,360
okay so getting the right equipment um

701
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,480
for those of you who haven't seen this

702
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,240
this is called the cyber defense matrix

703
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,039
uh one of the smartest people at insider

704
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,440
that i know is named sunil you

705
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,080
and rsa he debuted this and what it does

706
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,840
is on the left side we go down all the

707
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,440
classes of different kinds of assets and

708
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,320
people

709
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,640
and the top side are the phases of

710
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,080
security

711
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,440
starting with identification right

712
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,679
configuration management what do i got

713
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,000
then protection my ability to keep you

714
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,080
out

715
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,840
you're going to get in

716
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,520
what's my ability to detect to

717
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,200
understand what's happened and then

718
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,039
recover from that breach your attack

719
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,720
anything you have in your organization

720
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,440
should be able to fit in that matrix

721
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,200
any tool you have you should understand

722
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,880
it against that right so knowing what

723
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,919
you've already got in-house or available

724
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,520
mapped to this will give you the idea of

725
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,679
where your gaps are

726
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,880
which are probably going to be the kinds

727
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,080
of things that you want because you're

728
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,320
going to have felt those gaps

729
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,919
well now you have a way to put it in

730
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,520
order to go and decide where you're at

731
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,039
what capabilities you have and what you

732
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,360
want to do

733
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,559
as an army officer i always have to

734
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,480
simplify everything so i'm sure you've

735
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,720
all seen the lockheed martin kill chain

736
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,760
you've seen

737
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,520
minor attack and all of its infinite

738
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,440
expanding glory

739
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,679
the world is really just three attack

740
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,600
phases reconnaissance i'm learning about

741
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,919
you initial access i'm breaking in post

742
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,880
access i'm doing

743
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,520
and the business value the context of

744
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,840
that increases in post access

745
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,760
reconnaissance not a lot of control i

746
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,120
can have around that

747
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,880
it's really hard for me to really get a

748
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,320
lot of intricate detail what you're

749
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,840
doing yeah if i'm in that top of the top

750
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,840
percent i might have my entire like

751
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,960
dedicated threat intelligence

752
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,559
organization scraping the dark web for

753
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,960
them talking about my company at all

754
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,480
and what tools are about to come out but

755
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,840
how many of you have access to that

756
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,559
toward what purpose right when you have

757
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,760
that much money you get to do those

758
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,080
kinds of things initial access

759
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,520
does anybody think that there is a

760
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,039
system that a hacker

761
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,200
proverbially writ large approaching

762
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,600
infinity can't hack

763
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,080
everything is hackable

764
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,840
give me any scenario i guarantee you

765
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,360
there is a way to hack i had someone say

766
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,559
well i could just turn the computer off

767
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,440
guess what could still be done

768
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,399
post access is where the money is made

769
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:05,919
though literally

770
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,559
right initial access right your the

771
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,799
burglar has broken in open the door they

772
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:11,919
haven't stepped in yet they haven't done

773
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,600
anything

774
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,279
what they do next is what you care about

775
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,600
and what you can control

776
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,960
that's where you want to be able to

777
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,640
focus again as for those who are aware

778
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,159
this is where the increased focus on

779
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,159
detection engineering has come from so

780
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,720
the overall model is assume breach

781
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,480
i'm going to operate under the

782
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,840
assumption they're going to get in and

783
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,440
i'm going to focus on how do i find them

784
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,039
as quickly as possible

785
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,640
what's the most efficient way to do that

786
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,679
and the oh yeah so i forgot the metaphor

787
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:42,399
so

788
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,919
my joke here is elephants are scared of

789
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,399
fire right so in terms of getting your

790
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,200
boss convinced to do something

791
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,720
create some fire

792
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,679
right

793
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,679
elephants move with fire they are afraid

794
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:54,960
of fire when we were looking at things

795
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,159
like how do i get an elephant to move

796
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,399
how do i throw that elephant

797
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,039
demonstrating

798
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,919
vulnerability demonstrating risk

799
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,360
does that so that's how we're going to

800
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,919
create fire

801
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,520
okay so

802
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,520
what we want to do by creating this wire

803
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,760
is understand that we are this is an

804
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,200
expert data driven approach

805
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,880
not that we're just shouting fire in the

806
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,200
theater right

807
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,760
here's the problem we have to do this

808
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,039
that's the way yeah sorry so

809
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,200
great create a fire but what if there's

810
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,320
a fire

811
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,480
and your boss is already too scared of

812
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,919
the fire and they stop doing anything

813
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,679
so by showing them that there's risk

814
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,399
they go they get paralyzed

815
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,279
see it's happened

816
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,240
wow yeah yeah so i'm going to go back to

817
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,000
my earlier part about there's two kinds

818
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,240
of village sheets

819
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,840
that would be change job moment

820
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,640
yeah

821
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,159
yeah exactly if i can't throw the

822
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,559
elephant

823
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,000
go find another one right right away

824
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,600
yeah

825
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,279
that's our vote

826
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,720
the challenge is you have to speak their

827
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,399
language yes you can't say there's a

828
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,120
fire yes no no they don't care yeah

829
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,000
exactly this can cost us x number of

830
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,600
dollars

831
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,360
they wake up they move because now

832
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,480
you're speaking

833
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,480
profits and losses and that's at the end

834
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,159
of the day that's the discussion you

835
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:23,919
have to have absolutely

836
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,919
that's our next few slides

837
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,520
all right cool sorry i love it no it's

838
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,080
great i love that no i so if you haven't

839
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,520
picked up on this if i'm going to pick

840
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,200
on you you get to pick on me you get to

841
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,840
jump in this is a this is a team effort

842
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,679
okay so

843
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,240
what we're trying to do here is drive

844
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,679
context

845
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:44,640
with

846
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,960
expert demonstration we're not trying to

847
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,480
say there's a problem you have to fix

848
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,480
this because again going back to where

849
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,480
we fit on the list of things we may not

850
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,440
be the top priority

851
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,240
you may not be number two

852
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,799
so in terms of trying to make change you

853
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,039
can't expect to go from say number seven

854
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,530
on the list to be number one overnight

855
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:14,180
[Music]

856
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,120
okay so let's say you don't know how to

857
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,399
make fire

858
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,080
you don't have a threat intelligence

859
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,960
group

860
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,760
so this is the the i love giving simple

861
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,159
practical advice that is cheap is free

862
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,200
and you can actually go do it

863
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,159
immediately because i i again most

864
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:31,279
experts come up and they will spend

865
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,960
entire talks on we'll just do threat

866
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,320
modeling and do threat intelligence

867
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,960
split it up and say

868
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,399
okay like how am i supposed to go back

869
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,080
to my workplace and do that so here's a

870
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,760
cheap one

871
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,480
go to my tax site they have a list of

872
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,320
all of the known groups that do attacks

873
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,559
type in your industry just a simple text

874
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,320
search

875
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,600
it will show you every group that has

876
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,840
ever targeted your industry

877
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,919
boom done you now have your exact threat

878
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,799
groups oh but okay thanks bryson but how

879
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,559
do i actually make them happen there's a

880
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,080
hyperlink to each one that shows you

881
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,000
exactly how they do it

882
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,799
you now have a detailed plan of

883
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,840
techniques of what they do

884
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,399
threat intelligence for free creating

885
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,719
fire

886
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,600
work with other zoo keepers

887
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,000
who says you have to do this on your own

888
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,480
right elephants are difficult

889
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,440
why would you try to tap up by yourself

890
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,039
who's heard of purple tv

891
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,480
besides the guy wearing the purple shirt

892
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,320
say hi tim

893
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,000
hi

894
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,440
so who's who's heard of purple tv

895
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:41,760
oh from him from the guy with the purple

896
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,679
shirt oh did you go to his purple team

897
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,360
talk this morning did you talk the

898
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,640
sporting tip

899
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,519
you did what did you talk about

900
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:50,880
purple maturity model i feel like that

901
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,000
has something to do with purple taping

902
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,440
sorry i missed it it sounded wonderful

903
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,960
he says it was wonderful

904
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,200
great yeah it's good

905
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,799
oh you got to see it too yeah so what's

906
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,080
the purple team

907
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,200
red and blue

908
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,039
red and blue in between make them all

909
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,880
talk anyone else feel the finger paints

910
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,200
coming up

911
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,640
make them all talk same language

912
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,200
right so it is a collaborative milestone

913
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,919
driven approach slash process

914
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:16,799
right

915
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,440
instead of red versus blue it's red and

916
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,039
blue and we're going to work together to

917
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,480
do that right i'm going to bring in

918
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,799
other zookeepers and we're going to

919
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,640
light fire together

920
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,159
and we're going to analyze that fire

921
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,760
we're going to work through it

922
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,039
don't make me nervous i got 20 minutes

923
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,200
so what do we get from that right we get

924
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,480
insight

925
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,240
we get immediate improvements this is

926
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,600
one of the reasons purple teaming has

927
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,679
become popular is because instead of the

928
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,559
old way of

929
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,240
hacker du jour whether it's internal

930
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,480
external disappears comes back in next

931
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,360
period of time and says

932
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,760
fix it

933
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,039
how many of you have ever seen an

934
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,480
assessment where a year later the

935
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,120
assessment was the same result

936
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,640
yeah why why does that happen

937
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,039
because everybody's busy

938
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,559
and so have these folks come back with a

939
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,919
list of all the holes in my organization

940
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,918
but now i'm supposed to find more time

941
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,679
to do it

942
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,480
has anybody seen its truly shitty

943
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,280
assessment report

944
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,440
no nobody's ever seen a bad report oh

945
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,359
yeah yeah i'm like

946
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,879
i guarantee you everybody's received a

947
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,480
nessa scam

948
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,239
there you go

949
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,119
thanks

950
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,599
what yeah exactly it's yeah here there's

951
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,320
30 000 items

952
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,239
drop everything you're doing to do that

953
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,159
no it doesn't work right so that's

954
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,359
that's where we're doing that and then

955
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,040
what comes out of that is

956
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,159
again

957
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,679
business context

958
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,520
i want to do this in the context of what

959
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,040
matters to the business when i'm picking

960
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,560
something to evaluate whether that is a

961
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,040
control whether that is an asset whether

962
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,119
that is system systems whether that is a

963
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,159
process

964
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,599
it's something that's important to the

965
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,839
business that i want to be doing it with

966
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,280
i'm not just on my own going like well

967
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,599
this would be fun in the lab

968
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,280
and so by doing that you're already

969
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,119
aligned with both the improvements to

970
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,640
show to the business that you're talking

971
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,839
to the business and you can just

972
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,560
demonstrate that

973
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,000
um

974
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,760
and so tools training communication

975
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,040
sharing those are all the components of

976
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,800
that we'll have more detail

977
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,880
so building a plan

978
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,640
should be complicated

979
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,560
what's my threat how do i implement my

980
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,920
threat against what do i want to do it

981
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,040
with

982
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,400
actually do it

983
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,760
see what happens

984
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,920
iterate like that together

985
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,119
improvement

986
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,359
done

987
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:32,960
who's actually done a purple team

988
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,599
exercise in their work

989
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,599
you have

990
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,160
how often do you all do purple teams is

991
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,160
there a cadence yet are you just um yeah

992
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,560
so we do we do a complete purple team

993
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,560
every six months okay so every six

994
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,839
months

995
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:48,560
and

996
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,760
[Music]

997
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,240
how how much does this is not really a

998
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,520
leaking question no i'm going to phrase

999
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,480
it that way

1000
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,240
how much do the team members actually

1001
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,599
like the of exercise um

1002
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,359
the first time

1003
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:02,800
uh no

1004
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,839
nobody likes change the second time

1005
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:07,440
absolutely because everyone saw the

1006
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,800
value of it because they saw the value

1007
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,800
what was the value the value is now they

1008
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,040
were they could focus on what they

1009
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,359
needed to do it wasn't just it

1010
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,920
here's your quality and fix it it's

1011
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,079
here's the things that were

1012
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,160
that they were able to do on the red

1013
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,040
side

1014
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,280
let's see how we can stop it and we

1015
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,040
could focus what we were working on

1016
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,560
instead of trying to

1017
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,640
don't eat the elephant in one bite yeah

1018
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,680
right

1019
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,680
knife and a fork take a chunk at a time

1020
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,280
and work through it

1021
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,440
thank you for including an elephant

1022
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,320
i

1023
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,160
just had to 20 bucks in the mail

1024
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,480
okay so the best price of everything is

1025
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,480
free so i gave free advice on how to

1026
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,640
start fire i'm going to give free advice

1027
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,240
on how to actually turn that into fire

1028
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,040
so

1029
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,760
a few of us including uh george ortiz

1030
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,920
and adam aschinche who's over at red

1031
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,760
canary in charge of the atomic red scene

1032
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,240
program a couple of years ago we came up

1033
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,560
with this idea called the c2 matrix so

1034
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,200
where this came out of was i was the

1035
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,119
last speaker at the last derbycon and i

1036
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,720
wanted to i was starting to push this

1037
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,960
idea of adversary emulation and so i

1038
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,720
wanted free tools that are out there to

1039
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,160
do that

1040
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,520
well what's the problem with things that

1041
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,359
are free

1042
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,280
they're worth it they're worth it right

1043
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,760
you get what you pay for so turns out a

1044
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,800
lot of

1045
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,880
garage code hacked up stuff trying to

1046
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,640
demonstrate

1047
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,720
the demogods were not kind

1048
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,400
and i spent a lot of time trying to

1049
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,160
figure things out and so what we did is

1050
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,160
we created a community-based effort

1051
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,400
where we have folks in the community

1052
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,040
catalog everything that's out there

1053
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,560
how does it work how does it talk what

1054
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,320
are these characteristics so for you

1055
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,560
when you want to create fire it has a

1056
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,800
list of every c2 that we know of there

1057
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,640
are over 80 some that are currently

1058
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,640
there and you can say well based on the

1059
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,839
threat intelligence what i'm trying to

1060
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,359
do with my capabilities i want to do

1061
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,359
these things and it'll just tell you

1062
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,640
what's available that does that

1063
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,200
including we did a collaboration with

1064
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,280
sam's institute and created a free cali

1065
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,079
vm that has 10 of these tools already

1066
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,480
installed and put together for you all

1067
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,320
for free bye thank

1068
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:20,160
you okay so emulating ransomware

1069
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,520
ransomware seems to be kind of the thing

1070
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,400
right

1071
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,599
who's here for the malwarebytes

1072
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,320
ransomware talk

1073
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,880
right we're talking ransomware is a big

1074
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,040
deal but the problem with ransomware is

1075
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,440
destructive

1076
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,680
so testing destruction right we're we

1077
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,839
really are trying to emulate or simulate

1078
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,680
fire we're not trying to create actual

1079
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,920
fire

1080
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,280
our boss is gonna show up and then we're

1081
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,599
gonna get fired

1082
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,440
that was kind of funny

1083
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,599
no damn it

1084
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,119
dad joke failed

1085
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,240
so

1086
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,640
how do you create fire

1087
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,240
that looks realistic but doesn't

1088
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,320
actually burn anything

1089
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,040
so there's some solutions here

1090
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,920
one

1091
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,240
creating it on dummy data and so i have

1092
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,160
some examples here where you can one

1093
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,560
there's a site which will go and create

1094
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,240
simulated data to the fields you want

1095
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,520
which could also be useful for looking

1096
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,359
at detections can be looking useful for

1097
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,839
validating dlp any of those things free

1098
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,520
site out there put it together for you

1099
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,359
or you can just create dummy files so in

1100
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,280
the attack logic i have on the right of

1101
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,280
the test i'm right here it goes and

1102
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,280
creates a file a folder hit into the

1103
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,920
user populates it which is dummy sized

1104
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,520
files of garbage

1105
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,880
then locally encrypts them with the

1106
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,079
password

1107
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,280
calls home and says all right i've done

1108
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,440
this and then pulls down a

1109
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,560
notepad

1110
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,640
file text file pops it up and says

1111
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,720
you've been ranked somewhere contact id

1112
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,400
right

1113
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,160
does all of the hosts and network

1114
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,320
activities of ransomware but i haven't

1115
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,119
affected the user

1116
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,839
so start simple

1117
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,040
who's heard of powershell

1118
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,640
does your company use powershell

1119
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,520
yes

1120
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,720
you'd be surprised how many people don't

1121
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,079
know the answer to that did an

1122
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,520
assessment last year they didn't know

1123
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,200
they were using powershell

1124
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,400
why do attackers like powershell

1125
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,000
because it's already there because it's

1126
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,839
already there

1127
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,680
hackers are like you

1128
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,520
we're lazy

1129
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,880
i'm not going to do more work than i

1130
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,400
have to

1131
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,000
so if you are giving me the tools that

1132
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,200
are there i'm just going to take

1133
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,960
advantage of them powershell is

1134
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,599
phenomenally powerful so all i did was

1135
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,359
create a really simple basic thing

1136
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:37,799
command line call of powershell

1137
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,839
run who am i

1138
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,880
why would i run who am i

1139
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,440
see if i got privileged that's one

1140
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,599
answer what else tells you everything

1141
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,359
about your

1142
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,520
system yeah so i'm doing a basic recon

1143
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,839
turns out hackers are not a mission i

1144
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,760
don't know where i am half the time when

1145
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,920
i start so i want to start by going

1146
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,040
where am i

1147
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,640
more importantly like what privileges i

1148
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,319
have where i am relative to what's of

1149
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,240
interest at me

1150
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,920
should the average user be running who

1151
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,240
am i

1152
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:09,680
they can even find the command line

1153
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,440
interface that's a win

1154
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,680
let alone run who am i so we've now

1155
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,359
gotten this back into something that is

1156
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,799
innocuous that's already there

1157
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,800
the context of it makes it suspicious

1158
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,839
this is where we're getting into that

1159
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,119
detection engineering when we start

1160
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,400
looking at how we create fire in our

1161
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,119
environment in a valuable way for us to

1162
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,839
build up our detentions for engineering

1163
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:36,720
context simple things

1164
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,160
okay so who's heard of cismo

1165
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,879
what's this mom

1166
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,640
microsoft wrote a device driver called

1167
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,000
sysmon

1168
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,599
it's free

1169
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,119
it's since it's written by microsoft

1170
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,720
guess what it doesn't break with

1171
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,160
microsoft

1172
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,359
right isn't that the fun part when you

1173
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,800
have a third-party thing particularly if

1174
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,680
you've never worked with mac

1175
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,160
good luck great um there is a linux

1176
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,000
version that's coming out but sysmon is

1177
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,720
a device driver that is just capturing

1178
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,880
enriched logging for you so what does

1179
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,720
that get when i'm trying to drive

1180
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,960
enhanced detections i need to start with

1181
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,520
improving my visibility to correlate

1182
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,119
that data so that

1183
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:30,400
when i alert

1184
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,280
it's a high fidelity alert

1185
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,440
so in this case

1186
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,000
something simple right event id one

1187
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,359
is process creation of who am i

1188
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,599
which i can then tie to the context of

1189
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,359
where was it run because chances are

1190
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:46,800
again how often should that be running

1191
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,200
my enterprise something very simple

1192
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,599
powershell.exe

1193
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,000
powershell.exe tied to

1194
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,839
a network connection going out right

1195
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,520
should i see a powershell command happen

1196
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,680
and then something happened on dns

1197
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,880
no

1198
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,040
probably not

1199
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,960
sysmon allows a really easy way to put

1200
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,119
that together for you and it's free

1201
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,960
right free free free free are we seeing

1202
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,800
a trend and that one actually is not

1203
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,319
free with an asterisk that's that's the

1204
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:14,079
real deal that one is like highly

1205
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:15,440
engineered

1206
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,880
they should be charging for it they

1207
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,200
probably are going to at some point

1208
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,440
see that coming all right um living off

1209
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,200
the land binaries and scripts so i have

1210
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,040
here from my good friend over in europe

1211
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,760
olaf hartong they did an analysis of all

1212
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,119
of the living off the land binaries and

1213
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,359
scripts that were used in attacks by

1214
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:32,480
percentage

1215
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,680
so in terms of the things that are

1216
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,119
already there that an attacker wants to

1217
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,760
go to to start that fire themselves

1218
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,359
there's a list for you to start looking

1219
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:40,400
at

1220
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,560
so you can prioritize based on what's

1221
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,759
happening out there in the real world

1222
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,240
and of course with the link

1223
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,599
working with other zookeepers so i

1224
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,119
mentioned the security champions program

1225
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,319
now we're going to step outside of

1226
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,000
security because there are other

1227
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,160
zookeepers in this organization

1228
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,319
so security champion program is going to

1229
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,720
one co-op them for you

1230
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,119
to make your life easier doing

1231
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,160
to help wrestle those elements

1232
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,000
so how do we get people and other

1233
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
organizations

1234
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,160
to be a part of what we're doing why do

1235
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,520
we want to do that

1236
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,119
i mean isn't it easier if there was just

1237
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,000
sort of one person like jane for hr bob

1238
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,480
for finance

1239
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,160
that just knew a little bit more about

1240
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,440
security

1241
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,000
they just kind of cared that it existed

1242
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,880
that thinks about you occasionally

1243
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,680
perhaps wistfully

1244
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,319
so that when somebody in finance or hr

1245
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:38,000
has a question there's a natural point

1246
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,920
of contact for them to go to who again

1247
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,319
actually kind of cares you exist

1248
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:43,839
that sounds pretty cool

1249
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,760
that's a security champion program

1250
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,359
that's bringing other zookeepers in to

1251
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:51,160
help you wrestle that elephant

1252
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,920
now the problem of course is

1253
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,040
you're working with elephants and

1254
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,920
they're working with alligators

1255
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,400
so how do we speak to them right go back

1256
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,599
to earlier where we talked about

1257
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,359
understanding them same principle

1258
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,359
applies and so when we go and recruit

1259
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,280
them we need to find them and engage

1260
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,079
them

1261
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:10,160
you're not going to hr and say offer me

1262
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,240
a sacrifice

1263
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,440
volunteering anybody doesn't help

1264
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,680
but come up with different events lunch

1265
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,359
and learns different things to attract

1266
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:22,960
them find who naturally has an interest

1267
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,560
there's your target

1268
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,640
there's your gym

1269
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,480
bring them into the fold to that purple

1270
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,920
team exercise

1271
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,680
imagine being in hr getting to sit on

1272
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,000
something like that that's kind of cool

1273
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,599
they never get invited to things like

1274
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,760
that

1275
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,920
what kinds of ideas might pop out from

1276
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,960
them getting to be a part of that

1277
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,520
i'd be curious to know you don't know

1278
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,480
until you do it exactly and do you think

1279
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,079
somebody who's mildly interested would

1280
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:51,520
find that really

1281
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,680
interesting compared to their daily life

1282
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,680
absolutely

1283
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,720
yes

1284
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,520
a lot of what we've seen i mean we do

1285
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,839
table tops for incident response every

1286
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:02,640
year

1287
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,920
and we do invite hr we invite

1288
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,000
pretty much anybody that it might affect

1289
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,359
like this

1290
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:10,720
you know

1291
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,959
imaginary thing that we do a tabletop

1292
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,400
you say oh

1293
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,200
um don't don't ever do this and use this

1294
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,079
they go

1295
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,280
we've used that program for 10 years

1296
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,839
the one that is the security risk

1297
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,839
sorry

1298
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:36,160
you know that a lot of times you see

1299
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,240
like you talk to people like you know if

1300
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,839
you say hr never use uh you know the

1301
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:43,040
power

1302
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,240
shall uh give your data away

1303
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,760
and they're like oh we use that for

1304
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,720
business for 10 years

1305
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,850
you learn stuff like that yep

1306
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:56,210
[Music]

1307
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,359
all right so i do have a slide if i

1308
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:02,880
missed it already where i do talk about

1309
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,119
tabletop exercises um choose your own

1310
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,040
adventures um there are lots of ways

1311
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,880
that again we're lowering the technical

1312
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,960
bar and enabling to engage them in a way

1313
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,440
that's fun makes a little more gain-like

1314
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,599
and they learn something from it

1315
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,119
the think tank i'm associated where i'm

1316
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,839
a senior fellow i do the annual i.t

1317
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:21,440
training and what i do is i walk them

1318
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,040
through an incident response for

1319
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,319
choosing a choose your own venture that

1320
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:26,400
i wrote and so they don't have to

1321
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,599
understand anything about what's an

1322
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,040
endpoint what's a firewall because

1323
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,960
that's abstracted right you're in the

1324
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,640
role the presumed knowledge there is in

1325
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,160
the adventure you're taking and we're

1326
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:34,960
going to walk you through it you're

1327
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,800
going to learn what happens as a result

1328
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,000
and they love it they love it

1329
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:40,800
so

1330
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,119
um making trumpeting noises here

1331
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,040
in short put it in context show

1332
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,200
improvement over time

1333
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,040
uh if you're not sure where to start

1334
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,800
pick the most important things so i call

1335
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,440
the crown jewels assets

1336
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,520
what matters there start there establish

1337
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,800
control there you're going to get the

1338
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,079
business by it they're going to care

1339
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:59,920
about that and then you can work from

1340
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,079
there

1341
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,359
so what do execs slash elephants love

1342
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:08,640
they love metrics right so

1343
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,960
metrics

1344
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,640
so i created this i call it the

1345
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,559
detection maturity model so for security

1346
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:19,440
this is the path you want to take

1347
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,000
start with visibility what can i log

1348
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,599
based on that how do i start building

1349
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:25,599
higher level logic on top of it

1350
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,160
based on that how do i start to tie it

1351
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,079
into

1352
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,000
business context

1353
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
from there

1354
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,040
temporal

1355
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,800
right i've just measured what do i see

1356
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,319
what do i not see now i'm going to start

1357
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:40,160
measuring how quickly do i see it or

1358
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,599
should i have seen it and breaking that

1359
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:42,880
down

1360
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,720
right what did the tool see what did

1361
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,960
that person see that what how long did

1362
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,400
it take for them to actually understand

1363
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,760
it and then how long did it take to

1364
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,240
complete that process right

1365
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,119
[Music]

1366
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:54,880
then let's turn that into a continuous

1367
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,240
element tied into business

1368
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,558
let's find out over time where we go

1369
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,480
understand your audience

1370
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,599
and target your metrics to your audience

1371
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,160
if you're trying to talk to the ceo then

1372
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,319
you talk about how many detections we

1373
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,880
had for a specific

1374
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,240
vulnerability he will not care

1375
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,839
and if he doesn't care about that he

1376
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:23,200
won't care about anything else because

1377
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,720
you've just

1378
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:25,920
lost it

1379
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,960
so we emulated the north korean criminal

1380
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,040
gang that does this kind of thing it was

1381
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,599
against this part of our business it

1382
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,559
took us this long to find it and recover

1383
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,240
from it and that meant this amount of

1384
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,680
loss exactly who

1385
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,680
it's not hard when you think about it

1386
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,720
nope

1387
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,480
and you use different language when

1388
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,599
you're talking with a different part of

1389
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:48,960
the organization

1390
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,160
uh i was working with a marketing

1391
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,880
company i'm sorry manufacturing company

1392
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,839
and i was talking to younger engineering

1393
00:49:56,839 --> 00:49:59,359
group and we were talking about threat

1394
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,599
modeling and all this and said okay so i

1395
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,280
got this thing do you guys ever do stuff

1396
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,400
like that

1397
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,319
yeah we use fmea

1398
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,720
okay we'll use your framework

1399
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,640
tell the audience what fmea is uh

1400
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,599
failure mode and effects analysis

1401
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:14,720
um

1402
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,720
basically it's a way that they look at

1403
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,520
if this particular electrical connection

1404
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,319
fails what's what happens

1405
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,400
and so we walk through this

1406
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,599
security event from an fmea perspective

1407
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:28,960
and we're going through and we're i'm

1408
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,200
using them to get them what the scores

1409
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,760
are and i get one and

1410
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,520
i walk through the logic and this is so

1411
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,960
what score do you think it is i said

1412
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,720
well i think this is a ten

1413
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,240
and the room went silent

1414
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,839
what what did i say

1415
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,839
you said well

1416
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,079
when we're doing one of these for real

1417
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,079
if anything scores a 10

1418
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:52,480
the rule is you stop the meeting

1419
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,400
you walk out you find the general

1420
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,599
manager you bring him in and you explain

1421
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:00,240
what happened

1422
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,040
and they said okay so are you sure this

1423
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,440
is a ten it's like well your rules say

1424
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,359
this and this and this and this so yeah

1425
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:09,440
it's a 10.

1426
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,880
all of a sudden i had a bunch of

1427
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,559
engineering friends

1428
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,400
who would come back to me and they said

1429
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,800
well we're developing this new thing

1430
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,599
we would like to have you look at it

1431
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:23,599
before we write anything

1432
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:25,200
it works but you gotta talk to the

1433
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,480
language yeah

1434
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,000
that's a really cool story

1435
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,599
and it helps you through somebody else's

1436
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,920
elephant

1437
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,920
find another zookeeper so wrapping this

1438
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,559
up

1439
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,079
uh as we already jumped ahead on the

1440
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:40,079
slides take the top exercise um

1441
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,480
uh a reminder i'm gonna be leaving

1442
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,160
leaving a tabletop exercise for the ics

1443
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,800
village in two minutes

1444
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,760
um i i call this purple team plus so you

1445
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,440
can all be the first to hear this idea

1446
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,800
so this is something we've done a couple

1447
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,440
of times i haven't quite coalesced it to

1448
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,440
turn into research how to talk but the

1449
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,040
idea came up with the purple team plus

1450
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,520
is typically a purple team is a an

1451
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,040
operational level exercise right i'm

1452
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,480
wearing red i'm bringing blue we can

1453
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,839
have cross-functional elements at that

1454
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:07,839
level but the idea i've come up with and

1455
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:10,000
like i said done a couple of times is in

1456
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,319
parallel doing a tabletop exercise with

1457
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:14,240
the executives tied to that

1458
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,440
right

1459
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,319
so

1460
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:17,359
hey

1461
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,559
team c-suite as of this moment uh we

1462
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:22,400
don't know what it is but this apt has

1463
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,559
xyz as far as we can tell right and it's

1464
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:25,760
actually over here running and then

1465
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,359
you're going back and forth is as this

1466
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:28,640
is progressing and demonstrating what

1467
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,240
that is we're leading them through a

1468
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,559
tabletop exercise at the executive level

1469
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:33,839
of what that is

1470
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:35,599
so stay tuned i'm going to be putting

1471
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,760
that together i'm still still figuring

1472
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,319
it out ransomware's a really good

1473
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,720
is that ransomware is a really good

1474
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,920
exercise to do on all sides because you

1475
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,400
get general counsel in you get the cfo

1476
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,000
in how are you going to take this other

1477
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,760
relationship you're going to do this you

1478
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,240
did get everyone yeah you bring and you

1479
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,119
run two separate exercises together yep

1480
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:58,240
so

1481
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,680
how we fight against the juggle and of

1482
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:00,960
course it's always a quest for more

1483
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,640
money spaceball is a reference breaking

1484
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,820
out of the elephant thing thank you

1485
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:11,339
[Applause]
