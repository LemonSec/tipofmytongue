well hello there everyone i'm sorry i'm

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,199
not able to be there in person

24
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,360
i

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,680
decided that what i talk about today is

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,280
uh in part how i ended up where i am

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,360
because i'm often asked that by people

28
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,960
who want to know how to get into cyber

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,080
security

30
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,080
and i know corncon traditionally

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,240
attracts a lot of younger people who i

32
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,360
don't see there in any of the chairs

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,280
but

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,600
this part of

35
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,240
my presentation is kind of for them to

36
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,000
encourage them

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,600
and the second part is a little bit

38
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,080
about what i see coming based on my past

39
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,759
experience

40
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,000
so with that

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,240
let me start in on part one which is how

42
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,560
i got here and you can too

43
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,759
if you are not currently

44
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,280
um

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,720
so i

46
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,640
was born

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,200
no big surprise and and raised

48
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,880
um in

49
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,840
a suburb of rochester new york a little

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,040
town called

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,119
greece actually not a little town about

52
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,759
150 000 people now

53
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,600
um my

54
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,960
younger sister

55
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,240
also there

56
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,920
and coincidentally also has a phd and

57
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,200
served for a while as a college

58
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,280
professor

59
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,878
my father was an accountant and a world

60
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,400
war ii veteran

61
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,560
my mother was a

62
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,640
lifelong school teacher

63
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,200
i had an uncle working at nasa and an

64
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,840
uncle who taught business administration

65
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,400
at the schools in rochester

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,280
so i had a surrounding that was pretty

67
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,400
much

68
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,080
scholarly in nature

69
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,000
devoted to learning

70
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,440
and that had a big impact on my

71
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,680
my own interests

72
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,560
for those of you don't know where

73
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,080
rochester is

74
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,400
it's on the shores of lake ontario in

75
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,400
new york state

76
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,280
and the town of greece is

77
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,959
to the west

78
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,120
of the city of rochester

79
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,840
also bordering along lake ontario

80
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,400
my k-12 wasn't really all that

81
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,000
unusual in a lot of other people was

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,200
public schools nothing special

83
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,400
i

84
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,879
was however not like a lot of the other

85
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,760
kids

86
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,560
there in that i was really good at math

87
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,040
and science and not everybody was

88
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,879
if you think back to your own

89
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,680
uh school experiences

90
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,400
for some reason

91
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,000
many people just don't seem to get math

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,640
maybe they tell themselves that they

93
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,319
don't like it or their parents don't

94
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,920
like it but

95
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,200
i i find it very natural

96
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,599
i was terrible at sports and i guess

97
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,519
people who are good at sports could say

98
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,360
the same thing there that it seems very

99
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,760
natural and they don't understand why

100
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,720
people like me aren't good at it but uh

101
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,319
there are a number of reasons there that

102
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,840
i don't think i fit in at all

103
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,239
so i spent a lot of time reading i read

104
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,159
all kinds of books

105
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,959
history books science books a lot of

106
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,720
science fiction starting from a very

107
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,879
early age

108
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,120
and when i was there i got into an

109
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,519
experimental computer programming class

110
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,640
in 1972

111
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,480
learning how to use fortran on punch

112
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,920
cards

113
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,879
i was lucky in that regard

114
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,079
unlike modern curriculum modern schools

115
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,320
where computers are everywhere there

116
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,478
there was a computer that was at the

117
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,120
central school district office and we

118
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,199
had one hour a day where our programs

119
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,759
could be run so we coded them on punch

120
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,199
cards sent them over and then a week

121
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,520
later got the results back

122
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,120
definitely not

123
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,160
real time computing

124
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,040
uh

125
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,280
because i didn't stand out and i wasn't

126
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,520
much good in sports i had to develop a

127
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,800
sense of humor

128
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,080
to keep from getting picked on and

129
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,840
i won't say beaten up it wasn't quite

130
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,120
that stereotypical

131
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,840
generally that was not the case but

132
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,840
there was a lot of a lot of teasing and

133
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,440
a lot of

134
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,960
bad behavior

135
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,240
to those of us who didn't quite fit in

136
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,840
as other students did

137
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,840
and that included

138
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,919
socially not having a girlfriend at the

139
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,759
last two months of high school

140
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,600
so

141
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,080
my my high school background may not be

142
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,199
very different than many of uh many of

143
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,400
you in the audience

144
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,400
however one of the things i did in my

145
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,960
spare time was i got certified as an

146
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,639
emergency medical technician for the

147
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,919
state of new york

148
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,759
at the time i got my certification i was

149
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,600
the second youngest person to ever do

150
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,960
that

151
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,240
i had pursued this because for a while i

152
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,759
was thinking about

153
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,320
maybe i would have a potential career in

154
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,479
medicine because i sort of was

155
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,160
interested in that

156
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,680
it turns out

157
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,960
i learned

158
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,440
through the process of being an emt and

159
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,199
volunteering

160
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,440
that i would not make a good doctor

161
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,240
primarily because i was not able to

162
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,080
emotionally distance myself from the

163
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,160
people that i was

164
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,600
assisting

165
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,680
and that was a good thing to learn then

166
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,440
before i

167
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,680
decided to go on and do any college

168
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,080
training

169
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,960
um i ended up graduating and with a few

170
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,400
good friends

171
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,240
three of whom i'm still in touch with 50

172
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,600
years later

173
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,160
and so uh for those of you younger

174
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,400
people in the audience

175
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,360
or

176
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,800
watching through youtube

177
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,039
if you don't have a lot of

178
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,080
friends

179
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,800
in your high school days

180
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,919
don't uh don't take that badly because

181
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,520
time really wears on most relationships

182
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,360
um and you may have one or two good

183
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,440
friends that last for a while but not

184
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,800
necessarily very many

185
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,880
so i went off to college

186
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,479
and i started at the university of

187
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,919
rochester

188
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,919
with a double major in physics and math

189
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,240
and thought a little bit about chemistry

190
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,240
as i was going

191
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,400
and

192
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,560
i was also working two part-time jobs

193
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,919
because

194
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,759
tuition at the university of rochester

195
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,560
was

196
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,840
expensive

197
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,880
still is

198
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,560
it's a private college it is not cheap

199
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,960
to be a student there

200
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,039
and i was commuting from home because it

201
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,599
was cheaper to live at home and go to

202
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,840
schools so i was working two jobs

203
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,759
commuting and trying to do a double

204
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,919
major as a freshman

205
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,520
um one notable incident early in

206
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,680
about midway through the semester

207
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,520
i was so tired because i was only

208
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,840
sleeping about five hours a night

209
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,280
the room was a little overwhelmed and i

210
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,080
fell asleep in class one morning

211
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,319
uh it was a lecture class the professor

212
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,680
was going on

213
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,160
and i actually fell asleep and fell

214
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,800
face-first into the desk

215
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,560
rather forcibly

216
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,720
broke my glasses

217
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,039
and uh

218
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,639
the professor never missed a beat the

219
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,400
people around me thought i was

220
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,800
trying to make a joke uh was not the

221
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,840
case

222
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,000
uh i had to go get a new pair of frames

223
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,639
for my glasses but i took that as a sign

224
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,479
that maybe

225
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,720
the path i was pursuing wasn't really

226
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,520
going to quite work

227
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,919
and by the way there's the university of

228
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,440
rochester down there

229
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,360
it doesn't look like a long commute but

230
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,599
it was a about a a

231
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,400
half an hour commute one way

232
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,000
for me to go from home to classes

233
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,640
so after the first semester

234
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,279
my grades were not great

235
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,399
um

236
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,599
i

237
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,919
was just scraping by with the two

238
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,159
part-time jobs

239
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,279
and not really enjoying the experience

240
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,680
and then my father fell ill and he lost

241
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,279
his job

242
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,160
uh

243
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,200
at the same time my sister was

244
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,000
uh in her junior year in high school

245
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,800
and the economy had entered a recession

246
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,000
so this was not a good time

247
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,959
for

248
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,440
uh my father to

249
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,200
be out of work

250
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,080
so i took a leave of absence from

251
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,399
classes i decided that really wasn't the

252
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,080
way i wanted to go

253
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,720
and i decided i would seek a job

254
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,080
that would help

255
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,720
the family particularly my sister

256
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,480
um

257
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,720
you know to enjoy her last two years of

258
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,640
high school as well as to help the

259
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,279
family get by

260
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,080
after some searching i found one

261
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,800
as an assistant manager of a car wash

262
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
and i had an advantage with this because

263
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,959
one of my part-time jobs was

264
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,279
working at a car wash

265
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,320
not a great job

266
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,000
either working at the car wash or as an

267
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,680
assistant manager

268
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,600
because an assistant manager if you ever

269
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
are offered that position is basically

270
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,519
the person who has the responsibility to

271
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,839
do everything that no one else wants to

272
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,000
do

273
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,560
so it wasn't a great job but the pay was

274
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,320
regular and i could get overtime if i

275
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,279
wanted

276
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,320
and so i took the job and proceeded to

277
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,279
spend the next year and a half two years

278
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,560
at that job

279
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,279
and that was way over here in a town

280
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,519
called irondequoit

281
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,200
down the street from xerox labs and that

282
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,279
was also about a half an hour commute

283
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,600
one way

284
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,680
so at the car wash i actually learned

285
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,560
some valuable lessons about management

286
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,120
um because i had to deal with a number

287
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,640
of

288
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,399
people who worked there

289
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,320
i had to balance schedules and their

290
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,600
particular

291
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,839
skills and be able to persuade them to

292
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,120
do things they didn't necessarily want

293
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,160
to do and and i didn't want to do

294
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,160
i experienced a number of things that

295
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,839
someday i mean

296
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,240
build into a book because they were

297
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,200
funny

298
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,800
um

299
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,360
but i uh one of the real advantages that

300
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,160
i had lots of time to read and study

301
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,839
independently

302
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,000
we didn't have a lot of traffic

303
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,160
many months of the year and so while

304
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,240
waiting for cars to come in

305
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,519
i could read

306
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,839
and i kept a list i read over 50 books

307
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,519
in 18 months

308
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,279
including a number of textbooks for

309
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,920
classes that i would have taken

310
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,640
had i stayed in school

311
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,680
the whole experience really reinforced i

312
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,040
didn't want to do a job like that

313
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,399
and reading all the books had given me

314
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,760
ideas of things i might want to do

315
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,440
while i was working there

316
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,360
college opportunity number two came

317
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,839
along i my sister graduated from high

318
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:36,959
school

319
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,279
and was interested in a program at the

320
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,000
state university college at brockport

321
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,079
part of the suny system

322
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,519
it was a program called the alternate

323
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,720
college

324
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,200
and now called the delta college

325
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,800
it was a program financed by the

326
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,440
carnegie endowment to

327
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,519
find a way for students to finish an

328
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,320
undergraduate degree in three years

329
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,040
and it's still running there

330
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,720
this was very very new at the time

331
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,079
although a number of places have now

332
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,480
adopted it

333
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,720
so i drove her out to the meetings and

334
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,839
because i didn't have anything better to

335
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,680
do i sat in on them

336
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,000
and got interested in the program

337
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,880
i applied and was accepted and so was

338
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,200
she so the two of us started off as

339
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,480
freshmen

340
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,639
at the same time in the program there at

341
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,200
brockport

342
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,519
as a commuting student again to save

343
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,399
money by commuting from home this was

344
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,320
more affordable however because it was a

345
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,920
state school

346
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,880
and i didn't have to work two jobs

347
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,560
while i was there i rediscovered

348
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,920
computing

349
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,839
in one of the classes that i hadn't

350
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,600
really done anything with for about five

351
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,560
years

352
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,639
and realized that i really enjoyed it i

353
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,920
was really interested in it

354
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,120
uh so much so that the people at the

355
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,440
computing center gave me a position as a

356
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,519
helper in the computing center to keep

357
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,760
me out of trouble because i was very

358
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,680
interested in doing things that

359
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,839
weren't part of any of the classes

360
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,600
and sometimes they

361
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,560
didn't exactly mesh with what the

362
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,720
people running the computing center

363
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,360
wanted done

364
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,279
and just to complete the idea of

365
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,560
pictures

366
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,160
that's where brockport was in relation

367
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,360
to where i live

368
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,160
and that was about a 35-minute commute

369
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,639
each way

370
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,959
so i finished in three years with a

371
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,480
double major in math and computer

372
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,839
science

373
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,839
helped along in large part by all the

374
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,760
books i'd read i was able to test out of

375
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,639
a number of courses

376
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,560
and at the time my girlfriend of four

377
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,800
years had another year of undergrad to

378
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,839
finish and so

379
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,519
that sort of

380
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,440
created a window there where i had to

381
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,680
figure out something to do

382
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,639
until she graduated

383
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,360
i had an interested employer a prime

384
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,519
computer corporation doesn't exist

385
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,079
anymore a few people still remember it

386
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,839
they made some very interesting computer

387
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:02,959
systems

388
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,480
and um

389
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,160
while i was an undergrad that's what i

390
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,160
used and came up with a number of bug

391
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,160
fixes and

392
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,920
programs and things that got them very

393
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,639
interested they wanted to hire me

394
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,839
but when i said i needed a year before

395
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,240
um getting hired they suggest that i go

396
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,240
to grad school and then they could hire

397
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,320
me as a senior engineer which sounded

398
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,399
like a great idea

399
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,880
so i applied to georgia tech for a

400
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,639
master's program

401
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,680
because

402
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,560
first of all they had prime computers

403
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,880
and were well known for work in the area

404
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,480
and second my advisors were willing to

405
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,800
write letters there

406
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,720
i also applied to few other schools but

407
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,720
i ended up when they

408
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,040
accepted me i couldn't afford

409
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,440
based on the financial aid they gave me

410
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,000
or they were too far away

411
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,959
and georgia tech actually offered me a

412
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,399
fellowship

413
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,959
so that's where i went

414
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,040
down in atlanta

415
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,360
which is not a commute

416
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,880
um

417
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,320
it was a trip

418
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,199
during

419
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,680
spring break and christmas break

420
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,560
um that was about a 14-hour drive

421
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,839
if it was done non-stop

422
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,720
i ended up spending six years in atlanta

423
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,120
and it was very eventful in the first

424
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,480
year my

425
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,680
girlfriend

426
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,199
uh dumped me after graduation so

427
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,920
um that i did not see coming

428
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,600
and definitely sort of changed my plans

429
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,519
because during that same

430
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,800
first year i got interested in research

431
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,199
they involved me in several projects

432
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,759
i got fascinated with it and on the

433
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,079
basis of my work i got a scholarship

434
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,839
that helped pay tuition for the next few

435
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,440
years

436
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,199
so while there i picked up my masters

437
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,720
and then my phd

438
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,560
i had started in operating systems and

439
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,360
then

440
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,560
did my

441
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,079
dissertation work and distributed

442
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,399
reliable systems

443
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,959
with a postdoc and software engineering

444
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,040
none of that was in security although it

445
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,040
was all related because operating

446
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,680
systems distributed systems and software

447
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,600
engineering all touched on

448
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,000
aspects of of security at the time

449
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,839
i maybe wasn't as focused as i should

450
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,600
have been because i took a lot of extra

451
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
courses

452
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,839
that really didn't have bearing towards

453
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,360
getting me towards the degree but

454
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,680
eventually i did finish

455
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,519
i did also hang out in the computing

456
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,240
center a lot and continue to pick up

457
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,240
a little bits of information about

458
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,759
system administration and running

459
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,240
systems

460
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,399
and then i went to purdue

461
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,480
with a faculty position after my postdoc

462
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,199
and i've been there ever since

463
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,360
this is now going into um

464
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,399
my

465
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,880
uh what would that be right that would

466
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,000
be my

467
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,519
um

468
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,320
44th year i'm now in at purdue

469
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,079
i started at purdue actually as a

470
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,559
software engineer what i did my uh my

471
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,880
postdoc in

472
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,520
drifted into information security

473
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,520
through a number of of uh occurrences

474
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,480
i started the coast lab in 92 the sirius

475
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,880
center in 98. you can find more about

476
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,720
that online

477
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,520
and along the way um

478
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,199
a number of things

479
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,000
turned out to be

480
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,360
that i was in security at a good time

481
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,240
that uh advised to

482
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,320
many agencies i got to testify before

483
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,280
congress i've helped write a few books

484
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,760
um i've done a lot of travel

485
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,000
although looking at a world map there

486
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,440
are a lot of places i haven't been to

487
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,559
yet

488
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,720
south america and africa in particular

489
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,720
are two places i'd like to

490
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,280
to go visit

491
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,440
and realize during that

492
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,120
process that there's a lot more work to

493
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,120
be done and a lot of interesting

494
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,480
challenges

495
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,240
yet to be met

496
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,480
so i've spent a good focus of my career

497
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,559
on education and getting more people

498
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,600
involved in the field

499
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,760
so that's where i am today and if you

500
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,840
want to find out more you can go search

501
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,880
online

502
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,919
uh the intent here really is to say

503
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,640
it wasn't a smooth or straight path i

504
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,880
didn't really start out

505
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,520
looking at this as a career i started

506
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,160
off with it interested in security

507
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,120
and

508
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,679
then i sort of accidentally

509
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,000
got into a master's program

510
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,720
that

511
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,400
sort of coincidentally led into

512
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,799
something more and that led to security

513
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,480
for those of you who are starting out in

514
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,840
the field or maybe considering a change

515
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,679
the point here for you is that there are

516
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,480
many ways to get where you want to go

517
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,400
or where you really need to be

518
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,640
and they may not be obvious

519
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,200
that deciding where you want to go too

520
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,400
early may not be the right way instead

521
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,720
follow the things you like to do

522
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,160
and see where that leads you i think

523
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,480
that's actually a good advice in general

524
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,120
for life is at any particular point

525
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,039
don't necessarily think about what you

526
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,400
should be

527
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,320
but think about what you want to be

528
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,280
doing and that will take you places that

529
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,960
you might not ever have thought of

530
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,160
with that out of the way

531
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,280
i want to talk some about

532
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,400
predictions based on my experience as i

533
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,559
said 43 years at purdue and actually 50

534
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,320
years in computing

535
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,919
gives me some insight i think into

536
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,280
trends and history

537
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,480
i'll say that in my time with computing

538
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,200
i've learned over 100 computer languages

539
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,200
and worked on over a dozen

540
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,840
operating systems

541
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,760
i've built software that's been widely

542
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,880
used i've graduated a number of students

543
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,640
and and had a lot of experience with

544
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,320
companies in government

545
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,200
and and that sort of informs my

546
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,400
my uh

547
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,600
predictions

548
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,200
it's not that i've only worked in a

549
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,039
narrow area i've worked in a number i've

550
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,120
worked in operating systems software

551
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,799
engineering

552
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,120
certainly security privacy

553
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,360
cyber crime

554
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,199
national policy and some other issues

555
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,799
and

556
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,960
it's also based on what we see as trends

557
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,080
right now and i think these are four

558
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,520
major trends that really influence

559
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,200
these are the cyber security trends or

560
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,960
the cyber crime trends

561
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,679
that influence what we're likely to see

562
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:46,880
next

563
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,400
so the first is there are repeated and

564
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,400
ongoing stories about multi-year

565
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,840
penetrations

566
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,600
where companies discover that their

567
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,240
systems have been compromised

568
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,159
not simply for days

569
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,520
not simply for months but for years and

570
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,240
they didn't recognize it

571
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,320
this indicates that the security

572
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,760
controls

573
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,880
and

574
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,919
uh software that is deployed

575
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,720
is incredibly weak

576
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,039
that these kinds of incidents have gone

577
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,400
on for so long without being recognized

578
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,000
a second trend

579
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,039
is the amount of malware and malicious

580
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,720
activity

581
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,039
that's going on as a background

582
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,240
that

583
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,080
according to some of the vendors that

584
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,400
i've talked to of uh

585
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,559
security software

586
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,960
they're they're recording over a million

587
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,120
new distinct pieces of malware per day

588
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,960
and those are the ones that are simply

589
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,200
discovered and reported

590
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,120
it's well more than that that are going

591
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,320
on per day because the software now

592
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,039
mutates itself it changes and there are

593
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,840
so many different parties writing it

594
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,440
the total number that have ever been

595
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,760
released and deployed is well into the

596
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,840
billions

597
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,120
um

598
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,679
about 90 percent of successful detected

599
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,880
attacks

600
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,159
are made through unpatched

601
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,600
vulnerabilities

602
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,080
these are vulnerabilities that are known

603
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,120
these are bad practices that are known

604
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,320
and yet

605
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,120
the proper defense the proper fixes have

606
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,520
not been put into play and as as a

607
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,480
result those systems are fairly easy to

608
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,240
break into if you wanted to

609
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,120
that's

610
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,960
goes really in

611
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,000
in part along with the first point that

612
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,159
known defensive measures simply aren't

613
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,000
being deployed

614
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,400
and of course the rise of ransomware

615
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,480
where the victims are basically

616
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,880
subsidizing the attackers

617
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,520
and we have done an incredibly poor job

618
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,559
there

619
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:53,440
of

620
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,320
shutting that off or shutting that down

621
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,280
and as a result there is great incentive

622
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,640
for

623
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,000
repeat and larger versions of ransomware

624
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,760
to be distributed

625
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,760
and to increase

626
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,440
how much money is going to flow to the

627
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,559
criminals

628
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,640
so taken together this is kind of a

629
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,120
depressing scenario of where we are

630
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,799
but i think these are four trends that

631
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,120
are really influential in what we're

632
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,120
seeing

633
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,200
it also is in a context where i think

634
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,919
too few people who work in the field

635
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,720
really understand and have

636
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,200
taken to heart how fast the technology

637
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,880
is changing

638
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,400
um

639
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,600
the

640
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,960
oh say 50 years that we've gone from the

641
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,520
first transistor well that's actually 45

642
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,799
years

643
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,679
no 55 years uh the first transistorized

644
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,240
mainframe was 1958.

645
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,159
and that was very revolutionary at the

646
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,799
time now down to where we have

647
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,279
very small embedded sensors we're all

648
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,039
carrying around multiple computers on

649
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,200
our persons

650
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,320
incredible rate of change

651
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,400
but for those of us who work in this

652
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,360
field

653
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,520
unless we really force ourselves to stop

654
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,679
and step back we don't really think

655
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,640
about how rapid that change has been and

656
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,360
how significant it has been

657
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,080
but compared to other sciences and

658
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,760
technology fields

659
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,919
this is largely a very very young field

660
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,000
because it's only been a formal science

661
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,679
for about 50 years

662
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,000
if you compare that to physics or

663
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,200
chemistry to civil engineering to

664
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,720
medicine

665
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,799
all of those are much much older and

666
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,760
don't develop anywhere near as quickly

667
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,080
but if we do look to the past the future

668
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,400
may take on a slightly different cast

669
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,440
the the the past really does help inform

670
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,520
the future

671
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,360
because the past and part is defined

672
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,279
where we are now

673
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,840
that a lot of the software that we have

674
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,159
now a lot of the systems we have now

675
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,919
were designed the way they were because

676
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,320
hardware used to be expensive

677
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,240
for a long time if we

678
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,039
look at this at this range here it

679
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,960
wasn't really until

680
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,720
about 2000

681
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,159
that software cost began to dominate

682
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:17,520
hardware costs

683
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,520
and what we could build was governed

684
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,799
more by

685
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,960
uh the software than it was by how

686
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,360
expensive it was to custom build the

687
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,360
hardware

688
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,760
the capacity of storage communications

689
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,279
and processing

690
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,240
back during the 60s 70s

691
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,600
and 80s

692
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,159
governed a lot of the algorithms and the

693
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,039
mechanisms we used because we simply

694
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,279
were limited as to how much information

695
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,240
we could transmit or store

696
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,720
the von neumann architecture

697
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,559
governed a lot of what we have done in

698
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:53,360
security because

699
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,360
of the fact we had to reuse the

700
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,080
architectures we had to reuse the memory

701
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,159
and that governed a lot of how we built

702
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,520
systems

703
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,919
and compatibility has become a millstone

704
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,080
around our necks

705
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,760
you know metaphorically

706
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,400
because now when we build new systems

707
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,080
they have to be able to run the old

708
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,279
software

709
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,520
and and that means we have to accept the

710
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,919
old software with all the decisions that

711
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,400
were made some of which traced back 50

712
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,520
years

713
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,559
and all of the bugs and limitations of

714
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,639
the software that may go back 50 years

715
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,120
but but think about the changes

716
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,320
back in 1958 a computers

717
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,039
of of modest size

718
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,200
cost in the tens of millions of dollars

719
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,520
and took up

720
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,720
a big room all by itself plus a huge

721
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,039
amount of air conditioning to run

722
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,360
and it took a team of people to keep it

723
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,840
maintained and running

724
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,400
go forward 25 years and now we still

725
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,159
have something that occupies a room in

726
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,000
incredible air conditioning but it's a

727
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,520
super computer

728
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,600
uh that also doubles as a nice uh bench

729
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,520
arrangement if you're waiting around for

730
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,039
your processing

731
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,440
but these were the supercomputers still

732
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,600
cost tens of millions of dollars

733
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,880
but were

734
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,360
thousands if not hundreds of thousands

735
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,000
of times faster and more capable than 25

736
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
years before

737
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,200
25 years later

738
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,480
we have

739
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,159
iphones and android phones that two of

740
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,120
these

741
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,760
have more processing power and memory

742
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,080
capacity and storage

743
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:36,880
than

744
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,760
the supercomputers of 25 years before

745
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,320
that could only be afforded by

746
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,880
uh national agencies

747
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,520
that's really an incredible change

748
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,000
in capability

749
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,960
and yet we haven't really come to grips

750
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,520
with how that could change some of how

751
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,200
we do computing

752
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,039
and cyber security along with it

753
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,440
along with a change in processing power

754
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,120
is the change in

755
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,760
uh density of

756
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,320
storage

757
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,520
this approximate ratio that i described

758
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,840
here has been ongoing now for several

759
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,559
decades and basically at any point if

760
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,320
you were to look back

761
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,200
at the internet of ten years ago

762
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,240
you could

763
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,399
take the entire contents of that

764
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,679
internet

765
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,480
all of the research papers all of the

766
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,440
blogs all of the cat videos and you

767
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,720
could store those on about 50 commodity

768
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,000
pcs

769
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,760
in a good size room

770
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,799
with commodity disk

771
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,600
and 20 years ago if you looked at all of

772
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,399
what was on the internet at the time

773
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,320
that would currently fit today on a

774
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,158
single pc with a large disk

775
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,399
this approximate ratio has been ongoing

776
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,039
as i said now for more than a decade so

777
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,399
that at any point in time you can look

778
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,640
back 10 years and 20 years and the

779
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,600
growth and information and the ability

780
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,799
to save it and process it on a local

781
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,000
storage system is about the same

782
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,679
what that suggests

783
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,080
is that in about 20 years

784
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,840
all of the current internet content

785
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,880
should fit on one thing in your computer

786
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,679
whatever your computer looks like

787
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,360
you know maybe it's a foldable

788
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,520
instrument somewhat like this and that

789
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,679
this computer is going to have the

790
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,039
capacity

791
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,000
of

792
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,600
perhaps something like

793
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,320
uh the amazon cloud of today

794
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,080
in a single unit

795
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,559
that isn't to say oh gosh isn't that

796
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,880
wonderful isn't that amazing about how

797
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,120
we do this with hardware it's a question

798
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,520
of are we still going to be running

799
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,840
windows on something like this

800
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,279
are we still going to have the same

801
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,600
kinds of file systems and cludgy

802
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,799
interfaces that we have

803
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:05,120
with that kind of processing capacity

804
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,000
and that kind of information storage how

805
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,159
can we do things differently

806
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,799
to support computing to be able to

807
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,640
envision a future

808
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,679
that provides better capability that

809
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,679
reduces the amount

810
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,600
of false information

811
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,200
reduces the amount of computer attacks

812
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,240
increases our ability to actually get

813
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,640
useful information from the system when

814
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,320
we want it

815
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,240
those aren't questions that are being

816
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,559
asked

817
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,159
by most

818
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,840
um a few

819
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,240
visionary types are looking at that but

820
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,080
for most of the companies it's how are

821
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,880
they going to port the current version

822
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,240
of their product to the next generation

823
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,720
of computer there's no thought given to

824
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,919
the long-term vision of what could we do

825
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,240
with computing if we weren't constrained

826
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,600
by the past

827
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,600
and i think that's a huge

828
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,159
shortfall in our field particularly in

829
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,120
the area of security but more generally

830
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,720
in all the areas that we deal with

831
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,200
computing

832
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,200
so here's some interesting dates to help

833
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,039
also add to that

834
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,120
the first computer virus was back in

835
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,360
1982

836
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,600
that was nearly 40 years ago

837
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,080
we know how to prevent most computer

838
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,559
viruses and yet we're we're at the point

839
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,320
as i said where we have over a million a

840
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,200
day

841
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,840
in 40 years the situation has gotten

842
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,600
worse instead of better

843
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,720
the first computer worms were back 1988

844
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,480
1989

845
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,000
and again

846
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,720
still we have problems with these

847
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,399
the world wide web was invented in 1990

848
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,919
but now we have

849
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,679
still the world wide web with more

850
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,919
problems with misinformation with

851
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:56,960
propagandizing with

852
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,960
use for phishing attacks and watering

853
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,640
hole attacks

854
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,559
we don't seem to have evolved forward

855
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,039
we've actually had more problems develop

856
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,279
and so on with some of these others

857
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,000
the commercial internet isn't that old

858
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,919
really when you look at things

859
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,399
it's it's about 25 years old

860
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,200
and yet um many of the problems that

861
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,679
were manifest then have gotten worse we

862
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,200
haven't really solved some of the

863
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,279
problems that occurred including things

864
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,960
like distributed denial of service and

865
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,960
botnets

866
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,159
fundamental problems that we've known

867
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,200
about

868
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,960
for decades

869
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,000
are still present in modern systems

870
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
and in part that's because of commercial

871
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,440
pressures and lack of prioritization

872
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,840
correctness means that we specify what

873
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,159
something will do

874
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,840
and we can check against those

875
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,519
specifications

876
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,960
security additionally says that

877
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,120
it will do what's correct and nothing

878
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,080
more

879
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,519
and we can check against those

880
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,360
specifications

881
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,760
but we gave up on specifying software

882
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,399
decades ago outside of a few realms such

883
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:12,399
as in nuclear power and avionics

884
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:15,200
and we knew this was from 85 a system

885
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,960
that's not specified can never be wrong

886
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,440
it can only be surprising

887
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,279
we don't really have security problems

888
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,039
we just have surprises

889
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,200
because no one's ever really specified

890
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,480
what the software was supposed to do

891
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,080
in fact

892
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,559
and as a result it wasn't built to a set

893
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,640
of specifications that allowed us to

894
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,399
determine if it was functional or secure

895
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,200
if we can't define and design software

896
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,399
well enough

897
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,519
we're going we're going to have a

898
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,039
problem

899
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,799
as a result we keep adding things to

900
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,200
software and the complexity of the

901
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,120
software we have now is simply

902
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,480
overwhelming

903
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,799
we haven't specified it we've added too

904
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,360
many features it introduces too much

905
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,399
compatibility and we just are are

906
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,320
drowning in the complexity

907
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,799
it's a loop and we're stuck in the

908
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,359
problem and legacy is a big part of it

909
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,159
where we get new ideas for software

910
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,159
we build them we deploy that new

911
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,280
software

912
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,520
systems get slower

913
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,000
because we keep adding new features so

914
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,079
new hardware is designed that's faster

915
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,359
and has more memory we deploy it

916
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,359
now with all that extra capacity we get

917
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,000
new ideas for new software and again

918
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,159
gets built and deployed and we continue

919
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,599
in this cycle

920
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,239
we don't break out of this with

921
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,239
entirely new hardware designs and

922
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,760
entirely new software designs

923
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,320
because it simply isn't economically

924
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,839
feasible

925
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:46,639
this

926
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,879
leads to us avoiding investigating

927
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,280
fundamental issues such as is a von

928
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,119
neumann architecture the best way to

929
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,760
build things for example or should we

930
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,320
return to capability based systems which

931
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,880
were used to build some of the most

932
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,200
fundamentally security systems in in

933
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,680
history

934
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,560
and by the way not everything is

935
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,480
security and i would be

936
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,359
uh negligent not to point this out

937
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,280
we see thousands of security flaws

938
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,240
reported every year and no real idea how

939
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,000
many are unreported

940
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,920
but those are only the security related

941
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,280
flaws

942
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,119
how about all the other flaws that are

943
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,440
in software many of which don't get

944
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,560
reported or don't get fixed how do we

945
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,079
respond to those

946
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,640
and why are they there

947
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,800
the answer is usually we trigger the

948
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,280
bugs or we penetrate and patch

949
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,359
our approach to maintaining systems is

950
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,880
through patching

951
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,960
and this is not particularly a good

952
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,520
system it is beginning to show its

953
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,560
strain

954
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,640
some real strain because we can't get

955
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,480
the patches out quickly enough to

956
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,119
prevent attacks

957
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,599
um richard doncic

958
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,680
a systems thinker former secretary of

959
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,680
the navy

960
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,280
had a very

961
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,839
interesting uh analogy that i heard him

962
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,079
talk about and we discussed a bit

963
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,599
he said if we look back in astronomy

964
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,200
and

965
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,480
before that as well some astrology

966
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,359
there was this view of the universe

967
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,599
put forth by ptolemy

968
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,280
that um

969
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,520
was that the earth was the center of the

970
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,359
universe and everything

971
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,040
circled around us

972
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,720
that there were infinite stars out there

973
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,599
and that they also circled around the

974
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,880
earth

975
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,520
and this was based on observation

976
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,520
but whenever an observation came up that

977
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,000
was at odds with this so for instance we

978
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,320
talk about mercury retrograde because

979
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,000
mercury appears to make a loop and go in

980
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,320
the other direction for a while

981
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,160
what would happen is we would adjust our

982
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,000
model a little bit

983
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,440
we would say well mercury doesn't go in

984
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,520
a circle it goes into figure eight or

985
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,440
something else but we would still keep

986
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,040
this base model in place

987
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,119
when copernicus came along and came up

988
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,480
with a better

989
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,680
uh

990
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,680
model of the universe with the sun at

991
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,920
the center and earth being one of

992
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,240
several bodies that revolved around it

993
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,560
it was controversial

994
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,560
and it took a while to be accepted even

995
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,440
though it better explained phenomena and

996
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,839
it was something that actually worked

997
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,320
better in a day-to-day model when one

998
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,359
was looking at the universe

999
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,599
our toolmake view of security of

1000
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:30,960
computing

1001
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,520
is one that we just continue to patch

1002
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,920
the idea that we put things out quickly

1003
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,839
the users will find the flaws and then

1004
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,599
we'll patch them

1005
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,280
and that's kind of worked up until

1006
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,880
recently

1007
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,839
but

1008
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,200
the people who are interested in

1009
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,359
penetrating our systems have gotten so

1010
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,200
much better at reverse engineering those

1011
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,400
flaws

1012
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,280
that

1013
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,640
they're able

1014
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,839
within a matter of an hour

1015
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,280
sometimes less

1016
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,680
to take a release patch come up with an

1017
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,560
exploit and then attack systems that

1018
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,160
haven't gotten around to deploying the

1019
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,520
patches yet

1020
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,280
and we also have many

1021
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,839
uh users many places that can't

1022
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,880
immediately deploy patches because

1023
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,000
for instance they're in a medical

1024
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,200
business or a securities business

1025
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,200
where they're regulated and they have to

1026
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,720
be sure that the patches don't break

1027
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,400
something else

1028
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,119
so

1029
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,480
the tolerant view is breaking down

1030
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,800
the copernican view that that i put

1031
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,040
forth that others put forth that we

1032
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,960
should really sort of rethink how we are

1033
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,320
doing computing

1034
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,079
isn't appreciated because it costs money

1035
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,000
and it may not serve some government

1036
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
interests because it would make systems

1037
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,160
much more secure

1038
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,359
but

1039
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,520
the fact that it would change how we do

1040
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,560
computing

1041
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,880
to re-evaluate how systems are built and

1042
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,079
deployed

1043
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,240
to get away from having patches as the

1044
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,320
primary means of defense

1045
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,440
simply

1046
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,200
does not resonate well with most

1047
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,480
organizations

1048
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,040
because they don't have the staffing

1049
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,359
nor the budget to be able to deal with

1050
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,040
what it would really take

1051
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,359
to deploy systems that are secure from

1052
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,839
the start

1053
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,640
but the current system's a cluj

1054
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,400
and if we don't come up with a

1055
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,040
fundamental redesign before long

1056
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,079
it's really going to collapse around us

1057
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,599
gaps are showing now as i mentioned with

1058
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,960
gaps in patching and and other aspects

1059
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,880
of this ecosystem

1060
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,800
that we should take as warning signs

1061
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,320
so let me give you some what next

1062
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,320
um i've already mentioned these these

1063
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,599
are all the current marketing trends

1064
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,160
right more processors more data

1065
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,920
ai which i'm

1066
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,920
you know

1067
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,520
describing as threat or menace

1068
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,720
because

1069
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,119
it is being portrayed as the

1070
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,119
fix for so many things sort of like

1071
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,320
blockchain

1072
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,760
um

1073
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,000
there's the low cost of entry for new

1074
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,280
systems using legacy software

1075
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,119
the market continues to stress the wrong

1076
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,560
things

1077
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,800
add-on rather than architected shiny

1078
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,359
things like blockchain and ai

1079
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,319
more use of networking right 5g we're

1080
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,720
looking at 6g as a research topic and

1081
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,079
even people are writing now about 7g

1082
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,240
there's a big erosion of privacy because

1083
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,560
of big data and collection of data and

1084
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,319
governments are seeking greater control

1085
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,319
over the way the computing is used and

1086
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,079
that includes more access to private

1087
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,040
data

1088
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,800
so these are all trends that are going

1089
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,720
on right now

1090
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,520
against that we have organizations who

1091
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,440
are putting out

1092
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,280
more platforms that are that are

1093
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,960
networked and sharing and collecting

1094
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,800
data

1095
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,880
refrigerators

1096
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,480
drones automobiles self-driving and

1097
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,520
collecting

1098
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,599
we have all of these systems with

1099
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,599
embedded technology

1100
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,319
where security is an afterthought

1101
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:05,599
privacy is seldom considered at all

1102
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,760
so if you have a smart refrigerator that

1103
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,520
is keeping track of when you open the

1104
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,760
door and what foods you buy

1105
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,079
and has any of that stored locally

1106
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,680
it probably doesn't have much in the way

1107
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,040
of protection

1108
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,440
so that that information isn't shared

1109
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,040
not only with people who might want to

1110
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,000
use it for bad reasons but for

1111
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,760
advertising

1112
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,760
it may even be built in that it's shared

1113
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,760
for advertising and that's a reason that

1114
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,119
the vendor puts it in play

1115
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,880
this is a problem that's only going to

1116
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,119
continue we are seeing now with

1117
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,319
processors embedded in nearly everything

1118
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:41,920
we are seeing them embedded in

1119
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,520
healthcare equipment

1120
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,280
home appliances

1121
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,599
uh and and virtually everything else and

1122
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,040
they're being networked

1123
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,839
with 5g 6g and beyond

1124
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,319
to communicate and share information

1125
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:56,079
that's a major threat

1126
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,200
and it needs to be thought of as such

1127
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,200
ai as i mentioned

1128
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,839
um we have too many people

1129
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,160
trusting ai too much

1130
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,839
or trying to

1131
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,839
put too much value on it

1132
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,760
we're already seeing attacks on ai

1133
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,920
systems that we don't understand because

1134
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,640
ai systems are producing results we

1135
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,200
don't understand how they got them

1136
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,599
the goals of attacking eii are to

1137
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,760
contaminate the data

1138
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,760
or to

1139
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,760
give it the wrong inputs to influence

1140
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,240
the results or to disable it or even

1141
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,520
hold the aii systems for ransom

1142
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,079
the people developing these ai systems

1143
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,640
are not thinking about this as

1144
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,440
fundamental issues in their design

1145
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,880
we have a group of people who are

1146
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,760
thinking about security in ai

1147
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,400
but they are not the ones designing the

1148
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,920
base systems

1149
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,760
we need everybody who is working in this

1150
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,760
realm to think about ai

1151
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,839
and to possibly put a pause on where

1152
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,000
some of it is being deployed until

1153
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,160
they're able to come to terms with

1154
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,319
is the ai explainable

1155
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,240
do we know what it's doing and do we

1156
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,440
know how to prevent it from being

1157
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,400
contaminated and attacked

1158
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,880
the same is true with ot operational

1159
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,480
technology systems and industrial

1160
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,160
control

1161
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,839
most of the control systems that are out

1162
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,680
there are being deployed because they

1163
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,319
replace trained human operators and

1164
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:23,599
they're cheaper therefore to run

1165
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,520
but they're poorly protected

1166
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,680
we don't have a lot of checks in place

1167
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,800
to make sure that they're getting the

1168
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,960
correct results and taking the correct

1169
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,880
actions we're not protecting them

1170
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,760
against intrusion and road control

1171
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,200
and we're putting them in charge of

1172
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,520
things like our power transmission our

1173
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,319
transportation our factories

1174
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,040
and communication systems and more

1175
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,720
this results in things such as the

1176
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,200
colonial pipeline attack where we were

1177
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,839
worried that a major part of our

1178
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,560
infrastructure was going to be damaged

1179
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,319
and they actually had to take it offline

1180
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,319
because they didn't have confidence in

1181
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,560
their controls to keep it from being

1182
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,240
damaged

1183
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,440
think about that now for our power grid

1184
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,400
for our financial system our factories

1185
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,280
our chemical plants our communication

1186
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,599
systems as we have here

1187
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:17,520
radar gps and more

1188
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,560
our storage

1189
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,400
is another issue

1190
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,040
as it gets cheaper and larger there are

1191
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,040
some reasons why people are moving more

1192
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,520
to the cloud but that actually puts it

1193
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,280
into an environment where we have less

1194
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,680
visibility and control than if we had it

1195
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,119
local

1196
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,359
and that information

1197
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:38,720
is

1198
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,480
so cheap to store we seldom forget

1199
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,560
as a result we have information that

1200
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,800
collects that's old that's wrong that's

1201
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,200
out of date that's embarrassing

1202
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,119
and it's still out there some of which

1203
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,920
is still being used as part of these ai

1204
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,359
and big data

1205
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,440
algorithms

1206
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,319
and that's a problem

1207
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,520
europe's

1208
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,599
right to be forgotten law sort of

1209
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,480
touches on this but not completely

1210
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,560
several years back when north korea

1211
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,599
attacked the sony systems over over the

1212
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,040
movie that had been released

1213
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,520
one of the things they did was get

1214
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,119
personal information

1215
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,839
for thousands and thousands of users who

1216
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:23,599
had at one point been customer members

1217
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,160
of sony but had long since discontinued

1218
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,400
their membership but their financial and

1219
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,119
personal information was still on file

1220
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,920
because sony like with many firms found

1221
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,839
that it was cheaper to simply buy new

1222
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:38,000
storage rather than to go through and

1223
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,960
delete the old information and to curate

1224
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,240
it

1225
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,599
that's happening now with cloud

1226
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:46,400
providers and other businesses

1227
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,079
all that information

1228
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,319
is just going to outlive us

1229
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,560
possibly including errors

1230
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,480
and when it gets recombined those errors

1231
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,319
get back into the system

1232
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:57,839
it's not just a matter of someone

1233
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,079
introducing false information it's a

1234
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,160
matter of the system getting false

1235
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,079
information and old information on

1236
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,480
itself

1237
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,720
monetizing the hack as i said ransomware

1238
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,160
extortion

1239
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,720
is becoming really easy extortion as a

1240
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,400
service is out there

1241
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,160
on the dark web for a small amount of

1242
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,160
money you can license

1243
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,440
or lease

1244
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,480
extortion software phishing software

1245
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,160
along with ransomware that you can then

1246
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,560
deploy to targets

1247
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,119
for a cut of the

1248
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:33,440
amount that you recover that goes back

1249
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,680
to whoever wrote the software it's a

1250
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,839
thriving business and they're operating

1251
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:39,680
in places where law enforcement doesn't

1252
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,200
reach

1253
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,599
this is going to be a case for other

1254
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:47,040
kinds of malicious behavior cech we've

1255
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,119
seen it for ddos but various kinds of

1256
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,839
fraud and identity theft also are

1257
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:54,839
beginning to get into more crime as a

1258
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:58,160
service and if ransomware isn't enough

1259
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,839
to scare you right now

1260
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,359
think about what people are talking

1261
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:03,599
about for smart cities

1262
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,680
where an entire city

1263
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,839
has interconnected and intercontrolled

1264
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:11,119
computing

1265
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,680
and what happens when a city is held for

1266
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,040
ransom

1267
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,119
by one of these transnational

1268
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,280
organizations that really doesn't care

1269
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,440
that they're inconveniencing people just

1270
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,800
as they currently don't care that

1271
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,720
they're shutting down hospitals or

1272
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,480
schools or police agencies

1273
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,319
how much are they going to extort a city

1274
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:31,040
for

1275
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,640
and how many thousands or more of people

1276
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,640
are going to be hurt or inconvenienced

1277
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,280
because of it

1278
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,839
so overall our near future is going to

1279
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:43,760
be more challenging and it's easy to

1280
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,440
extrapolate from trends like these i

1281
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,760
encourage you to do it yourself

1282
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,599
step back and instead of thinking about

1283
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:52,400
what you're working on today look back

1284
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,720
10 years and sort of extrapolate where

1285
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,800
things are likely to go

1286
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,480
we're going to see more systems in more

1287
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,480
places with more connectivity

1288
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,240
it's going to be cheaper so more people

1289
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,079
are going to want to put it out

1290
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:05,920
and because the hardware is cheaper

1291
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,680
they're going to want to have cheap

1292
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,599
software so that means they're going to

1293
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:11,359
use what's already out there they're

1294
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,200
going to reuse

1295
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,319
the the legacy software to simply port

1296
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:19,280
it with all its bugs and all its flaws

1297
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,680
and all its bad design onto these new

1298
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,359
systems

1299
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,040
the criminals are getting more

1300
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,599
experience by the day they are building

1301
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:30,880
more sophisticated systems by the day

1302
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,280
and they are not constrained by some of

1303
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,160
the same issues of budget and law that

1304
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,760
the rest of us are

1305
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,760
they are ahead of us and they are going

1306
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,839
to continue to be ahead of us as long as

1307
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,319
we continue to use the old flawed

1308
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:45,760
systems

1309
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,280
there's going to be more pressure on

1310
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,520
governments to intervene

1311
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,400
but the way they know to intervene is to

1312
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,280
actually put themselves into the systems

1313
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,760
rather than to cause them to be

1314
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,400
redesigned and in many cases some of

1315
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,319
those governments themselves are the big

1316
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:03,280
threats

1317
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,720
to privacy

1318
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,119
um and and to being able to have secure

1319
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,040
system

1320
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,960
so for those of you who in the audience

1321
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,480
were early in your careers are thinking

1322
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,720
about that as a career

1323
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,240
and from what i can see in this

1324
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,640
thumbnail picture that probably isn't

1325
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,920
any of you

1326
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,079
but i would say there's lots of

1327
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,000
opportunity for work and security yet to

1328
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,520
come

1329
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,000
both from trying to keep our current

1330
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,200
clergy systems working to being able to

1331
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,440
design new ones that are more resistant

1332
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,240
and use better principles

1333
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,920
so to make progress

1334
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,520
we have to be able to make a certain

1335
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,559
investment a significant investment

1336
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:45,760
in new foundations and new starts where

1337
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,480
things are simply going to get worse

1338
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,319
that's going to be hard to do but we

1339
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:53,680
need to convince people to do that

1340
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,599
and we continue to use artifacts we

1341
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:56,839
don't completely

1342
00:49:56,839 --> 00:49:59,040
understand they're purchased because of

1343
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,359
cost not because of functionality or

1344
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:02,800
security

1345
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,640
often developed in haste to be first to

1346
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,760
market

1347
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,599
with characteristics we can't measure

1348
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:09,680
because we can't measure how secure

1349
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,040
something is

1350
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,640
if we don't know what security is we

1351
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,000
don't know what the features are we

1352
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,079
certainly can't measure it and they have

1353
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,800
a long history of flaws

1354
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,960
if you look at this as a

1355
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,960
storm it's not going to end well it's

1356
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,480
not a perfect storm but it's a pretty

1357
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,800
bad one

1358
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,599
so i would say we need more eager

1359
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:31,680
aware people to move the field in the

1360
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,280
right direction

1361
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,760
and that's going to take all of us

1362
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,200
so if this is an area that you're

1363
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,480
interested in or you're currently

1364
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,640
working in

1365
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,800
good for you if it's one you're thinking

1366
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,040
about you might want to move into

1367
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,800
great idea

1368
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,119
and with that i think i have 10 minutes

1369
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,960
or so for questions

1370
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,720
so thank you very much for listening in

1371
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,480
here and

1372
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,920
let's see if anybody has some questions

1373
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,640
i can respond to

1374
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,160
i see some of you moving so i know

1375
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,879
you're still awake

1376
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,599
no questions okay

1377
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:19,040
well

1378
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,760
as you move about here um

1379
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,119
you run into any of the younger

1380
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:25,040
attendees of the conference tell them

1381
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,640
and check out the recording because it

1382
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,319
was really intended more for some of the

1383
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:29,280
younger

1384
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,559
the younger people who attend the

1385
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:31,599
conference

1386
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:33,760
um

1387
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,760
and

1388
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,880
maybe maybe that's why none of you have

1389
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,079
questions

1390
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:42,400
uh

1391
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,240
but

1392
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,400
thank you very much for your attention i

1393
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,000

1394
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,440

1396
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,319

1397
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:53,760
but um

1398
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,920
in these times of covid things have to

1399
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,240
change just a little bit for some of us

1400
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,119
so

1401
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:00,880

1402
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,839
