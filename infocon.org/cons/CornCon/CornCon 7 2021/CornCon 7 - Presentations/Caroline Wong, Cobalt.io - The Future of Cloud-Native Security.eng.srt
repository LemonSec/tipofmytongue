1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,040
all right so i want to introduce

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,799
caroline wong

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:07,919
um

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,160
caroline's at uh

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,679
at cobalt

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,920
and uh

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,719
your

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,840
presentation today is going to be on

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,680
cloud security

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,800
so caroline take it away

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,840
wonderful

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,800
john

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,840
thank you so much i do wish that we

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,599
could be physically in the same place

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,920
together i would give you a big big hug

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,280
this is not a bad backup option

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,320
and so

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,879
here i am my name is caroline i'm the

19
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,360
chief strategy officer at cobalt i am

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,480
thrilled to be here today with you uh

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,800
virtually at corncon

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,440
um so i started my devsecops career

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,760
16 years ago now leading information

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,879
security teams at ebay and zynga

25
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,359
and these were super cool places to be

26
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,319
working in cyber security in both cases

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,000
we were running online operations 24x7

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,320
with millions of simultaneous users

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,520
daily

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,439
ebay had an uptime requirement of

31
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:17,759
99.94 percent and as one of the first

32
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,159
major electronic commerce shops

33
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,640
enabled strangers to transact with each

34
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,520
other over the internet

35
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,400
zingo was growing incredibly rapidly

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,159
as an early adopter of amazon aws

37
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,040
in 2009 the zynga game farmville

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,360
launched and in just a few weeks the

39
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,400
game went from zero to 10 million daily

40
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,840
active users

41
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,799
a few months later it rose to 80 million

42
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,799
daily active users

43
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,960
and so now at cobalt

44
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,079
we build

45
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,799
security software and like so many

46
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,880
devops companies

47
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,320
we have

48
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,280
data driven product based teams

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,680
naturally we value automation and

50
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,840
failing fast

51
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,360
and so today i want to talk about

52
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,160
five interwoven themes

53
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,920
theme number one

54
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,120
modern software and internet security is

55
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,599
not a zero-sum game

56
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,200
theme number two

57
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,360
the hardest problems to solve in cyber

58
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,280
security are not technical problems

59
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,840
theme number three the most powerful

60
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,400
solutions that are required to address

61
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,480
cyber security problems today will

62
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,720
require people and process innovation

63
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,400
theme number four

64
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,280
cyber security has many different facets

65
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,400
and it can seem complicated but it is

66
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,959
not impossibly complex

67
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,200
there are fundamentals that we as

68
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,680
industry professionals can rely on and

69
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,080
we should not allow ourselves to get too

70
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,319
caught up in the myth

71
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,879
that these problems are too hard to

72
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,560
solve

73
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,159
number five

74
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,400
protecting the world's digital value

75
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,440
is not something that is just the job of

76
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,840
security professionals or just the job

77
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,280
of developers

78
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,519
cyber security has always been an

79
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,000
outcome a result

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,400
of the behaviors and interactions and

81
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,440
decisions and actions of many different

82
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,800
people

83
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,120
this has never been more true than it is

84
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,159
today

85
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,159
and i really believe

86
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,200
that we are all in this together

87
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,480
my hope

88
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,720
is that if you're working in devsecops

89
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,360
on a day-to-day basis as you are making

90
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,000
decisions and solving problems and

91
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,599
making things happen

92
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,519
that these themes

93
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,360
might be something that you can draw

94
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,159
upon for inspiration

95
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,480
i do expect that these themes will

96
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,760
continue to evolve but when i ask myself

97
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,200
why am i excited about the future of

98
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,959
security cloud native

99
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,560
these are some of the answers that i

100
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,280
have today

101
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,200
so

102
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,959
modern software and internet security is

103
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,360
not a zero-sum game

104
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,439
first and foremost

105
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,000
security is about protecting value

106
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,238
in today's modern world a lot of the

107
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,959
things that we value are shifting

108
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,800
from the physical realm to the digital

109
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,639
realm and that is why cyber security is

110
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,199
so important

111
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,520
now security practitioners used to have

112
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,639
this story that they would tell about

113
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,919
how to think about cyber security

114
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,639
the story said that if john and i are

115
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,479
running away from a bear

116
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,040
i don't have to outrun the bear i just

117
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,680
have to run faster than john

118
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,320
and so in this scenario the underlying

119
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,199
assumption is that i value myself and i

120
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,199
don't value john

121
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,160
my success doesn't depend on john and so

122
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,120
as long as i get away from the bear

123
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,360
it doesn't matter to me if jon becomes

124
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,759
the bear's lunch

125
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,199
the problem

126
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,000
with this analogy and there are several

127
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,800
is that in reality software companies

128
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,960
and the digital value created by

129
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,880
organizations does not exist in silos

130
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,880
we are not independent islands

131
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,840
i actually think that a more appropriate

132
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,000
analogy for how things work in cyber

133
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,120
security

134
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,280
is a three-legged race

135
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,360
because in a three-legged race my

136
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,759
partner and i are dependent upon each

137
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,039
other

138
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,160
in order to win we have to work together

139
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,680
in lockstep

140
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,840
and i really think this is more of how

141
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,479
it is today when it comes to software

142
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,400
security

143
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,400
every software company

144
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,199
including ours is part of a tightly

145
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,600
interwoven ecosystem

146
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,520
of software companies that provide a

147
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,160
variety of products and services

148
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,280
each of those companies can use other

149
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,520
software companies to help them do their

150
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,400
work

151
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,400
and so on

152
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,039
a perfect example of this dependency

153
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,600
between software companies happened to

154
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,880
me on monday january 4th

155
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,759
that morning i woke up next to my

156
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,360
five-year-old daughter on the bottom

157
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,440
bunk of her bunk bed and i looked at my

158
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,639
phone

159
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,960
it was my first day back at work after a

160
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,759
two-day vacation two-week vacation

161
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,400
and i had received this text message

162
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,720
from my friend and colleague anna

163
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,319
it oops

164
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,360
it turned out that slack was down

165
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,000
and that outage lasted about six hours

166
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,520
or so

167
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,160
this was not an ideal way

168
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,560
to start the first working day

169
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,360
of the new year

170
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,800
at cobalt we're a hyper growth

171
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,120
b2b sas company

172
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,840
today we serve nearly 1 000 customers

173
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,759
and we use about 75 or so vendors

174
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,400
and so you can think about the company

175
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,800
and any devops company really

176
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,479
like a tree

177
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,800
the vendors we rely on are like the

178
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,120
roots of the tree and the customers are

179
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,199
like the branches

180
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,319
and of course for any sas company if all

181
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,680
goes well

182
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,000
hopefully those branches will will bear

183
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,120
fruit year after year

184
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,400
i alluded to this i have two young kids

185
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,639
and so we watch a lot of disney movies

186
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,000
in our house

187
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,840
and so as i was thinking about this

188
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,080
particular theme i couldn't help but

189
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,479
think of the song lyric from the disney

190
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,400
movie pocahontas

191
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,319
and we are all connected to each other

192
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,560
in a circle in a hoop that never ends

193
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,000
because

194
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,720
i think that really is how it is

195
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,879
with modern software companies

196
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,960
and this means that security is not

197
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,520
something that we can care about in a

198
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,800
vacuum

199
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,120
we must acknowledge the dependencies

200
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,280
that we have on other software

201
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,000
organizations for the state of our

202
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,680
security

203
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,039
it is no longer enough to care

204
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,520
just about the security of your own

205
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,199
organization

206
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,840
because your partner's in security

207
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,879
your vendors in security

208
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,080
these things affect your risk profile

209
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,680
and the ability

210
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,759
to protect the value that you create

211
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,760
so theme number two

212
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,360
is this idea that

213
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,000
the hardest problems to solve and cyber

214
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,760
security are not

215
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,919
technical

216
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,880
i am the linkedin learning instructor

217
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,480
for the master the owasp top 10 uh

218
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,920
learning path

219
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,760
and uh the new version came out

220
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,839
yesterday so that is super exciting i'm

221
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,600
actually going to be

222
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,200
recording a new course on the update

223
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,399
and

224
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,120
a little story that i want to share

225
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,920
is that before i started creating the

226
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,920
content for these instructional videos

227
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,600
in 2018

228
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,240
i actually didn't understand

229
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,399
all the details of the top 10.

230
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,680
now

231
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,519
the first version

232
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,000
of the owasp top 10 came out in 2003

233
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,920
and i started my career in cyber

234
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,640
security in 2005.

235
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,720
i became the chief of staff to the

236
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,080
global information security team at ebay

237
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,600
and naturally

238
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,160
at a place like ebay web application

239
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,040
security was and is of extremely high

240
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,200
importance

241
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,959
the problem was that every once in a

242
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,920
while so i knew that oawas top 10 was

243
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,080
super important and i tried to learn it

244
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,080
and so i would download the document and

245
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,240
i would try to read it and i would get

246
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,519
stuck

247
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,200
i would get bored or i would get

248
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
confused or something more urgent would

249
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,399
come up and i would put it back down

250
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,160
so i never really learned all the

251
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,560
details until i had to teach it to other

252
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,320
people

253
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,560
now

254
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,560
the latest version just came out

255
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,920
yesterday

256
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,880
and

257
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,480
i will have

258
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,279
thoughtful thorough comments about it

259
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,600
um

260
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,839
the crazy thing is

261
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,600
having looked at it

262
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,160
briefly

263
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,279
despite the oau's top 10 having gone

264
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,920
through several iterations over now the

265
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,800
past 17 years

266
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,600
the types of issues that we find in web

267
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,440
applications is pretty much still the

268
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,640
same

269
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,880
this is the same stuff

270
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,959
that the best and the brightest in our

271
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,839
industry have been talking about for 17

272
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,240
years if i had a kid

273
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,959
when the first a wasp top 10 came out

274
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,560
that kid

275
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,680
would be driving a car today and about

276
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,160
to and able to vote in the 2024 election

277
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,720
i mean 17 years is a long time so why

278
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,360
haven't these problems been fixed

279
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,079
because we know as an industry we know

280
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,600
how to find these issues and we know how

281
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,200
to fix them

282
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,920
and we know how to prevent them

283
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,480
so this is this is frustrating and silly

284
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,279
and also a fascinating problem for us to

285
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,440
solve um sometimes when i think about

286
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,680
the rest of my career

287
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,000
in cyber security i think to myself you

288
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,360
know what

289
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,600
by the end of my career i really want us

290
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,640
to have a different owasp top ten and

291
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,640
not because

292
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,320
we just pick different things to put on

293
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,440
it

294
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,279
i want it to be different because we've

295
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,200
actually been able to

296
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,440
eliminate some of these problems

297
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,600
in our software

298
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,680
so

299
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,680
along the same

300
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,120
thread

301
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,880
next i want to talk about this common

302
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,959
misconception that the biggest and the

303
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,120
baddest problems in software security

304
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,160
are technical problems

305
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,079
let's talk about

306
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,320
the 2017 equifax breach more than 140

307
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,639
million people affected a widely

308
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,399
accepted theory that the attackers were

309
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,680
state-sponsored spies from china a ceo

310
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,760
who stepped down three weeks after the

311
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,399
breach became public 1.4 billion dollars

312
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,160
to clean up the mess and an ftc

313
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,519
settlement

314
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,680
how did this breach happen

315
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,000
it was not because of a super

316
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,600
sophisticated zero-day technical issue

317
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,240
it was because some software was found

318
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,920
to be vulnerable

319
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,560
and a patch was made available

320
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,079
and equifax did not deploy the patch

321
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,959
this was not a crazy technical problem

322
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,519
that lacked a solution

323
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,880
the technical solution was available

324
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,639
this was

325
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,079
in my mind a lack of people and process

326
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,399
innovation

327
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,480
now last year threat actors managed to

328
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,639
plant malware in some monitoring

329
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:13,839
software

330
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,399
which happened to be in use by some

331
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,200
hundreds of organizations and when the

332
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,680
news first broke this breach was

333
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,440
described as a highly sophisticated

334
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,160
targeted and manual supply chain attack

335
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,399
by an outside nation state which sounds

336
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,839
very intense and it

337
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,120
is but

338
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,680
when you draw back the curtain

339
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,600
it seems as though maybe they use the

340
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,240
password solarwinds123

341
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,519
to protect the company's update server

342
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,240
in which case it is no wonder malicious

343
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,160
threat actors took advantage and planted

344
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,320
some malware

345
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,880
this is unfortunately

346
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,440
a simple security misconfiguration

347
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,639
now at cobalt we do pen testing we do a

348
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,360
lot a lot a lot of pen testing

349
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,360
in this year's state of pen testing

350
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,680
report which covers data from more than

351
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,079
1600 pen tests

352
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,600
we reported that security

353
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,560
misconfiguration was the number one most

354
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,800
commonly identified vulnerability type

355
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,519
found across cobalt pen tests

356
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,279
for the fourth year in a row

357
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,279
so we know

358
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,720
about this

359
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,880
um

360
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,040
we're just not

361
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,240
doing

362
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,160
the simple

363
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,279
not easy but simple

364
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,399
things

365
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,000
in order to

366
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,760
prevent it

367
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,279
and sometimes

368
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,079
i wonder about why

369
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,639
you know um

370
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,880
today actually

371
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,959
my father-in-law

372
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,480
became a

373
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,800
ransomware victim

374
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,800
his wife my mother-in-law called me

375
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,360
and she said

376
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,199
he's on the phone

377
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,399
and they're asking for payment

378
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,720
and i said okay well

379
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,320
is it his work computer or is it his

380
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,160
home computer and she said it's his home

381
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,600
computer

382
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,440
and i said okay well

383
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,680
it might actually be illegal for him to

384
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,600
pay the ransom and even if he pays

385
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,760
there's no guarantee that he's going to

386
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,680
get his data back

387
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,279
so that's a really tough position to be

388
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,040
in now

389
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,800
i think that

390
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,440
as a technologist and as someone who's

391
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,399
been in cyber for 16 years it is

392
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,759
relatively easy for me to say

393
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,519
look

394
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,160
update your software

395
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,480
install your patches

396
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,399
do some backups

397
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,839
and make sure they work

398
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,240
like so many things in life this is

399
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,079
easier said than done

400
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,199
and while i think that

401
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,800
you know

402
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,880
for a person

403
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,040
who

404
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,839
is not necessarily a technology expert

405
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,560
these are things that

406
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,000
might not happen

407
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,480
day to day

408
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,519
and for an organization it's even harder

409
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,839
and i think that the reason it's so hard

410
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,120
is actually because

411
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,360
i think it's actually because it's kind

412
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,480
of boring

413
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,600
you know

414
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,560
i've been in those meetings where

415
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,320
technologists get together and they say

416
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,120
look

417
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,320
what are we planning for the next

418
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,839
quarter you know how are we going to

419
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,519
spend our resources what are the

420
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,199
exciting projects what are the quick

421
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,720
wins what's going to get us more revenue

422
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,120
and

423
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,959
backups

424
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,880
don't usually make it to the top of that

425
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,759
list i think it's because

426
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,759
it's kind of boring

427
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,639
and it's not that sexy and so

428
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,400
i don't know if we need to make it less

429
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,199
boring more sexy or if we just need to

430
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,199
acknowledge that sometimes important

431
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,640
stuff

432
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,640
just has to get done

433
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,039
even if it's

434
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,359
kind of boring

435
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,520
okay

436
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,520
theme number four

437
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,319
cybersecurity has many different facets

438
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,640
and it can seem complicated

439
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,880
but i believe it is not impossibly

440
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,400
complex

441
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,520
because

442
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,480
i

443
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,360
know that there are fundamentals that we

444
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,919
as industry professionals can rely on

445
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,160
and we should not allow ourselves to get

446
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,400
too caught up in the myth

447
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,880
that these problems are too hard to

448
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,480
solve

449
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,600
in 2005 as a new college grad i started

450
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,080
my first ever full-time job

451
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,840
as an information security engineer at

452
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,120
ebay

453
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,640
and when i walked in the door i was

454
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,679
handed a 50-page stack of information

455
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,240
security policies and i was told that i

456
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,400
was responsible for answering questions

457
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,440
about it

458
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,280
from technology teams and from the

459
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,280
business

460
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,880
this was overwhelming i thought to

461
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,080
myself

462
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,919
how am i ever going to learn all this

463
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,400
stuff it seems so complex

464
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,799
after a few months i found out

465
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,640
that by meeting with different people

466
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,760
who had questions about ebay security

467
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,880
policy

468
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,480
writing them down

469
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,799
asking my manager and going back to that

470
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,880
person to share with them

471
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,440
my newly acquired answer

472
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,760
i found out that people were asking the

473
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,840
same questions over and over

474
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,520
again throughout my career i have been

475
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,840
on two security teams as a practitioner

476
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,240
i have led a global product management

477
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,880
team i've done some consulting and i'm

478
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,679
currently at my first startup

479
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,640
this series of diverse experiences has

480
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,000
helped me to see that cyber security is

481
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,840
complicated

482
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,960
but it is not impossibly complex

483
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,280
and just as an fyi the background for

484
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,600
this particular slide

485
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,400
if you google cso mind map

486
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,080
uh then then then you'll see this

487
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,080
graphic

488
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,080
so

489
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,520
backing up

490
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,160
come on slide

491
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,840
okay

492
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,520
nist 853 is nearly 500 pages long i have

493
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,440
read every single one of those pages

494
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,160
it's a long document pci dss is more

495
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,360
than 130 pages long the bsam

496
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,919
is more than 100 pages long and the asvs

497
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,280
is more than 60 pages long

498
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,320
this is just it's just so much

499
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,960
so much text it's so much paper it's so

500
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,919
much why is it so much

501
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,240
i really think that the fundamental

502
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,039
principles of cyber security

503
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,960
and application security for that matter

504
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,720
software security

505
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,480
whatever you want to call it

506
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,480
devops devsecops

507
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,200
i think it can be boiled down to four

508
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,840
basic building blocks

509
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,000
a couple of years ago

510
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,520
some of my colleagues and i worked

511
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,520
together on a white paper called a

512
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,360
practitioner's guide to application

513
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,039
security

514
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,320
it is a 20-page document that outlines

515
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,760
how simple

516
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,200
not easy

517
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,880
but simple

518
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,240
application security can be

519
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,559
is still available on the internet

520
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,400
you can google

521
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,039
the practitioner's guide to application

522
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,480
security

523
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,520
and

524
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,240
get your 20-page copy for free it

525
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,400
includes this one-page poster

526
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,640
that we call the modern appsec framework

527
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,080
and this framework has just four

528
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,679
components

529
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,679
number one govern

530
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,840
aka know your assets number two find

531
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,919
number three fix

532
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,960
and number four prevent

533
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,400
now

534
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,720
right now in cyber security land there

535
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,480
is a lot of emphasis on automation

536
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,640
this storyline says because we have a

537
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,360
lot of cyber security problems

538
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,760
and we also have a talent shortage

539
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,840
you should try to automate as much as

540
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,559
possible so that you are less dependent

541
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,039
on people

542
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,600
i happen to strongly disagree that

543
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,000
automation can solve all of the world's

544
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,400
cyber security problems

545
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,880
as my friend and former colleague

546
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,039
vanessa sauder eloquently shared in her

547
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,520
b-science presentation last year there

548
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,919
are entire classes

549
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,080
of security vulnerabilities that can

550
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,880
only be discovered by humans

551
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,679
finding things like race conditions

552
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,679
business logic flaws

553
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,760
and chained exploits

554
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,080
which are some of the most

555
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,600
interesting ones

556
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,480
uh these cannot be automated we need

557
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,520
human creativity human innovation human

558
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,679
judgment human opinion and human

559
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,200
decisions

560
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,840
to drive the right outcomes in this

561
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,000
industry

562
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,600
it is true that software is being

563
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,080
developed faster and faster and some

564
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,840
cyber security teams are using

565
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,440
automation to manage some of the

566
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,840
incredible volume of work

567
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,080
that they're trying to tackle

568
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,440
however

569
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,280
i think that solving the most important

570
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,159
cyber security problems have to include

571
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,080
both automation

572
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,200
and manual effort

573
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,840
i think that both devops and deficit

574
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,880
cops

575
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,679
benefits by innovating when it comes to

576
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,159
people and process

577
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,520
security practitioners in particular

578
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,520
we need a better model for talent

579
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,640
distribution we need standardized

580
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,120
automated workflows

581
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,880
that can take the friction out of

582
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,120
working cross-functionally

583
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,960
between security and engineering teams

584
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,320
to find and fix security issues because

585
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,200
it is often not the security person who

586
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,240
can actually fix a vulnerability

587
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,080
it's usually the security person's job

588
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,320
to go and find

589
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,280
the developer the engineer who actually

590
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,320
has access to and the ability to make

591
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,120
these changes convince them

592
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,880
that this is an important thing to do

593
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,799
and to prioritize it and to actually get

594
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,960
it fixed security and engineering have

595
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,360
to work hand in hand security can find

596
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,280
problems all day long

597
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,120
but if we want to get these problems

598
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,120
fixed we've got a partner we've got to

599
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,678
collaborate

600
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,279
now

601
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,960
i'm just waiting for my slide to update

602
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,679
you got this slide okay

603
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,440
we talked about

604
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,159
people in process innovation

605
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,279
and here is my cheeky analogy

606
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,880
consider for a moment the following

607
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,880
hypothetical scenario

608
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,799
imagine that we're in the midst of a

609
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,600
global pandemic and a highly infectious

610
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,679
deadly virus is affecting millions of

611
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,559
people around the world it is so bad

612
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,039
that in the world's richest country more

613
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,039
than half a million people have already

614
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,240
died from this disease

615
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,279
if you think it's a technical problem

616
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,440
then you might think that the most

617
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,200
important thing to do is to develop a

618
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,279
vaccine

619
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,159
developing a vaccine is a super hard

620
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,640
scientific problem to solve

621
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,360
and there are lots of very smart very

622
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,600
capable scientists who can figure that

623
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,440
out

624
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,279
but what happens when an effective

625
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,000
vaccine is created

626
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,559
the technical issue is solved

627
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,000
so does that problem just disappear

628
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,080
of course not

629
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,960
in some ways it might actually be easier

630
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,559
to invent

631
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,520
a new vaccine than it is to figure out

632
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,600
how to do your procurement how to do

633
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,080
distribution how to do communication and

634
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,600
how to actually get people vaccinated

635
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,120
just as we can know about the owasp top

636
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,840
10 for 20

637
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,080
years doesn't mean we can eliminate and

638
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,520
forget about those types of problems

639
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,320
just because you have a vaccine doesn't

640
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,200
mean

641
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,960
that you can vaccinate enough people to

642
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,799
eliminate and forget about a pandemic

643
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,640
so i'm here to challenge

644
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,039
where we are as an industry and to look

645
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,679
forward to imagine where we might be

646
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,039
headed

647
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,760
it is time for us to examine the

648
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,600
principles that we think about when it

649
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,760
comes to cyber security

650
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,919
and how the future of cloud native

651
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,159
security is going to be

652
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,159
because it will be what we make of it

653
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,400
i want to end this talk

654
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,559
by describing something that i believe

655
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,039
is completely fundamental and yet

656
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,360
not often acknowledged

657
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,919
in the security industry

658
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,320
security is not a vitamin

659
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,320
or a band-aid

660
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,799
it is not something you can inject

661
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,360
or do at the last minute or add on after

662
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,440
the fact it is not a feature

663
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,279
security has always been the result

664
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,240
of decisions and actions made by many

665
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,159
different people

666
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,159
it's actually the outcome of an

667
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,159
unpredictable dance

668
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,240
between many people

669
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,799
and so i think that for devsecops to be

670
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,559
successful

671
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,159
we've got to build a collaborative

672
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,960
approach that brings us together

673
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,279
if you know how to salsa or lindy hop

674
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,679
you can extend a hand invite a partner

675
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,080
and step onto the dance floor but

676
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,320
security is not always invited to the

677
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,080
party

678
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,480
too often development security and

679
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,679
operations dance alone

680
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,159
we must invent the dance style to sync

681
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,520
our movements

682
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,440
and create a beautiful partnership

683
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,279
it is friday afternoon

684
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,600
i am ending this talk with some lyrics

685
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,200
from high school musical

686
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,520
we are all in this together once we know

687
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,760
that we are we're all stars and we see

688
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,440
