1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,680
all right richard thiem

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,679
speaking today on how it's important for

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,960
leaders to be hackers

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,120
this is reprising his

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,520
defcon 1 keynote

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,000
he's rethought this topic and

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,840
has some ideas to share with the

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,680
audience today thank you for coming

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,640
richard

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,640
thanks john it's a pleasure to be be

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,599
here

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,320
uh wherever here is it's a

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,479
zoom on top of cyberspace

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,600
uh and i wish i could be in uh in iowa

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,120
with you

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,280
but next year in jerusalem

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,480
uh yes john i said it was 25 years ago

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,480
that you did a talk called

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,399
hacking as practice for trans-planetary

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,280
life for defcon 4. that was my first

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,840
defcon and i have spoken there uh for 25

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,520
straight years with only a couple of

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,879
misses

24
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,000
and

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,680
when he asked me to do it i looked back

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,159
on the talk and it

27
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,320
really did predict a lot of things or

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,840
say a lot of things were coming that

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,880
were absolutely borne out

30
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,960
i have a good track record of seeing the

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,360
future much more clearly than i can see

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,400
the present

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,759
and when i revisited i asked myself

34
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,000
what is it i would want to say about how

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,640
much things have changed as a result of

36
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,439
everything that i identified 25 years

37
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,759
ago coming to be and then all kinds of

38
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,799
other things on top of it and i realized

39
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,079
that things have

40
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,640
fundamentally changed to a completely

41
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,119
different level of operation

42
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,759
and to be a hacker is a totally

43
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,920
different operation

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,320
than it was 25 years ago

45
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,720
the skills and approach and thought

46
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,119
world may be the same but

47
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:51,920
the

48
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,880
evolution of a meta system

49
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,600
uh on top of what hackers and others

50
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,640
built over a quarter century uh has has

51
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,399
made the necessity of thinking

52
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,600
differently

53
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,960
um

54
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,159
compelling

55
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,600
and imperative

56
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,119
now thinking differently is something

57
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,360
you're going to hear a lot in talks and

58
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,520
from leadership and so on uh thinking

59
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,920
differently is very easy to think about

60
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,640
and it's easy to talk about but actually

61
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,480
thinking differently is really hard and

62
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,959
that's what i want to approach today i

63
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,440
want to look at what it really takes

64
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,319
uh when we're facing a set of conditions

65
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,480
uh this is just the future is not what

66
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,840
it used to be

67
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,879
and we do need to think differently

68
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,720
about it

69
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,959
so i'm going to say my main thesis in

70
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,200
several different ways because it really

71
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,800
is going to be tricky to get our minds

72
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,879
around it and get a hold of it in a way

73
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,680
that

74
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,519
might be useful

75
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,200
well here it is

76
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,239
we need to think about security not only

77
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,440
in the detailed and specific ways which

78
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,239
preoccupy professionals in the field but

79
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,599
at a meta

80
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,720
level

81
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,680
we need to think at a meta level because

82
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,640
the meta level we have created

83
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,599
is thinking about us

84
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,560
and it is not concerned with us in the

85
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,239
same way that we

86
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,840
are concerned with

87
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,280
it uh the meta level is the source of

88
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,280
our thinking and behavior

89
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,800
in many ways

90
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,959
it inflects us

91
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,480
it shapes us

92
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,120
it assimilates us

93
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,040
so the machinery

94
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,720
the network

95
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,200
uh is thinking in its own terms and that

96
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,879
presents unique challenges and if we

97
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,599
don't meet those challenges uh by really

98
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,200
thinking about them the playing field

99
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,599
will not be level and it will be tilted

100
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,280
in the favor of the machine

101
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,319
not us the bottom line is skynet does

102
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,519
not need killer robots if it can take us

103
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,599
over as easily as the russians took

104
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,720
crimea without a single shot being fired

105
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,280
and with soft power

106
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,720
net is here but it operates not with a

107
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,480
bang but with a whimper

108
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,760
okay

109
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,840
so what did i say 25 years ago that'll

110
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,760
be the touchstone of

111
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,400
how i proceed the digital revolution was

112
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,279
eroding borders and boundaries

113
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,600
and one result was that the real sources

114
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,839
of power and influence that inflicted

115
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,639
our behavior was no longer national it

116
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,199
was transnational i did a talk many

117
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,240
years ago uh the uh chief officer of the

118
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,960
fbi office in chicago was there and i

119
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,160
was talking about boundaries going down

120
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,320
and borders going down

121
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,520
and

122
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,800
um

123
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,759
that

124
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,280
this was going to cause i'm being

125
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,919
distracted by someone staring at me out

126
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,000
of the other side of the screen i'm not

127
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,160
sure what's going on over there uh but

128
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,240
that's the nature of zoom i guess i'm

129
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,400
left looking at a pipe that looks like

130
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,600
an oxygen hose to the very machinery i'm

131
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,240
describing uh and anyway i talked about

132
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,880
how you couldn't count on a national and

133
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,520
patriotic motivation any longer and the

134
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,680
fbi uh chief

135
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,560
agent said you know bingo

136
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,560
he said we used to be able to recruit

137
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,039
people on the basis of patriotism and

138
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,960
they would always be glad to help us and

139
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,280
now what i hear more and more he said

140
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,919
was i would like to help you butt

141
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,919
and that butt was because the

142
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,600
transnational entities that were

143
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,000
emerging as powerful

144
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,199
uh superseded nation-states and as much

145
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,120
as people like to think of themselves

146
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,560
especially today

147
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,440
as americans and patriotic americans the

148
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,919
the fact is that our behaviors uh think

149
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,320
of apple think of microsoft think of the

150
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,199
big banks they're international and they

151
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,199
are not concerned with individual

152
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,400
countries except insofar as they need to

153
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,199
mix and match a variety of sets of laws

154
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,800
and regulations

155
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,919
so

156
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,919
apple in china is different from apple

157
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,280
here very moral country here in china

158
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,479
wink wink

159
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,240
you want to do business in china you

160
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,560
have to ignore your moral scruples and

161
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,440
what china is doing and meanwhile china

162
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,759
is taking over companies

163
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,479
all over the world and then exercising

164
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,039
the same kind of censorship that they do

165
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,680
at home uh harmonizing the society

166
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,479
through digital technologies uh all over

167
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,160
the world um a chinese company owns amc

168
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,639
the chain of theaters and you tell me

169
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,560
next time you see richard gere or lady

170
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,600
gaga show up at a theater

171
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,280
owned by amc i.e owned by a chinese

172
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,280
international conglomerate

173
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,240
so

174
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,000
i'm going to outline the big issues and

175
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,160
if we look at them and say as a society

176
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,560
well those are so big oh oh my we can't

177
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,280
do

178
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,880
thing about that

179
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,639
then all we will do especially in

180
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,720
information security is continue to

181
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,599
tweak the systems we are already using

182
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,400
which constitute a paradigm for behavior

183
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,000
and operations

184
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,440
and we will miss

185
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,199
that the defense is to protect the

186
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,360
perimeter which no longer exists

187
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,120
as you know it's a coastline with a

188
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,840
thousand bays and inlets

189
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,319
uh not a single unbroken circle around

190
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,360
quote us unquote uh we have to make the

191
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,800
systemic fundamental changes we need uh

192
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,199
one example of course is climate change

193
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,039
i hope i don't have to point out that

194
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,520
the intensity of storms rising sea

195
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,880
levels water wars droughts fires etc

196
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,440
are a function of climate change which

197
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,520
is going to profoundly impact national

198
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,319
international security but we say oh

199
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,319
well climate change that's so big we'll

200
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,520
never get green enough uh and and so on

201
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,680
but if we don't we're just gonna keep

202
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,759
bailing out basements in new york every

203
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,160
time a storm happens instead of dealing

204
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,879
with the systemic causes that make the

205
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,160
necessity

206
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,199
of security and information uh

207
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,840
uh information security uh necessary in

208
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,800
the first place okay so this talk is

209
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,400
going to be about expanding your

210
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,720
consciousness now i really mean that it

211
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,120
might sound a little new again

212
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,720
uh here and there

213
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,440
but it's really not it's about using all

214
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,800
of your brain

215
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,680
and all of your faculties uh including

216
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,759
different parts of your brain including

217
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,080
different modes of consciousness to

218
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,960
enhance your habitual modes of cognition

219
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,960
and understanding because you're

220
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,080
engaging with computer networks not just

221
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,479
through the cognitive artifacts you know

222
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,039
in your brain but through a whole field

223
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,799
of consciousness

224
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,039
it's the field of consciousness that we

225
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,599
fundamentally are not that we have but

226
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,120
that we are

227
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,959
and the network

228
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,680
is a field of consciousness with which

229
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,240
we engage electromagnetically

230
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,399
but also i'm going to suggest in other

231
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,640
ways and it covers the earth and it goes

232
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,560
out to the moon and the lagrange points

233
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,360
and asteroid belts or chinese are on the

234
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,519
dark side of the moon and we're on mars

235
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,440
and we're exploring planetary systems

236
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,440
and soon we will be out of our solar

237
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,600
system and our explorations beyond the

238
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,240
merely visual identification of planets

239
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,880
likely to harbor life in addition to our

240
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,080
own

241
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,200
so this is the challenge we have to meet

242
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,120
the extended network

243
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,920
and you as a collective

244
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,640
are fields of consciousness engaged with

245
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,360
one another and that requires you to

246
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,839
identify them on a meta level and think

247
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,920
differently now what do i mean by

248
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,760
thinking differently let me give you an

249
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,040
example from a different world

250
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,279
and it points out how difficult it is to

251
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,200
make that pivot this woman named

252
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,880
elizabeth lloyd meyer she was a

253
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,000
scientist

254
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,680
she had all the accoutrements of a

255
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,760
zionist rational

256
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,000
distrusted anything but materialism she

257
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,160
taught in the psychology department of

258
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,920
uc berkeley

259
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,920
and the university medical center she

260
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,760
was a therapist and she had an

261
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,279
eleven-year-old daughter who played with

262
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,720
a a very beautiful and rare harp which

263
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,399
was once stolen from the theater where

264
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,640
she played in a christmas concert and

265
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,720
they tried everything to get it back

266
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,240
they used the police they used

267
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,480
association newsletters they went to

268
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,320
dealers and instruments

269
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,240
cbs even did a news story about him

270
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,600
nothing worked

271
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,240
a friend suggested she use a dowser well

272
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,720
that's crazy she said because she's a

273
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,880
rational scientist but she tried

274
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,360
everything else so she gave it a shot

275
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,680
she called a guy named harold mccoy in

276
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,440
fayetteville arkansas

277
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,720
and he said

278
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,560
give him some time he would see if the

279
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,040
harp was still in oakland he called back

280
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,040
and he said yes it was and asked her to

281
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,519
send him a street map of oakland and she

282
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,839
did and he got back to her and said the

283
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,079
harp is in the second house on the right

284
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:48,880
on

285
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,200
d street just off l avenue he told her

286
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,279
exactly where it was she located the

287
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,880
house but the police couldn't go in

288
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,680
without a warrant so she posted flyers

289
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,600
in a two-block area all around that

290
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,399
house

291
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,720
and got a call from a teenager who said

292
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,880
he saw the harp and his neighbor had it

293
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,959
and he would get it from him and meet

294
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,279
her that night meet him that night at 10

295
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,160
o'clock in a safeway parking lot she

296
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,480
thought well i've gone this far she went

297
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,920
and sure enough there was a young

298
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,560
teenager with the harp and he returned

299
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,399
it to her

300
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,640
all right this is the point

301
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,320
what she thought was this changes

302
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,600
everything

303
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,720
now she wrote a book called

304
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,120
extraordinary knowing in which the more

305
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,880
she talked about the reality of this

306
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,320
experience and how it became a fulcrum

307
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,000
around which her understanding of

308
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,320
consciousness in the world subsequently

309
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,720
spun then colleagues especially in

310
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,320
medicine

311
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
told her all sorts of stories which you

312
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,839
know it's kind of interesting we're

313
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,639
we're ashamed of experiences like this

314
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,399
uh we'll talk about anything sexual

315
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,279
that's all all good but we uh when i

316
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,120
would talk about ufo phenomena people

317
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,880
would wait afterward like they had been

318
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,959
abused by the phenomenon say well i've

319
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,880
never told anybody this but let me tell

320
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,639
you what happened one night well her

321
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,639
colleagues began doing that

322
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,720
and they began doing it about the same

323
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,320
kind of experi experience that she had

324
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,360
which was

325
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,920
to get outside of her habitual way of

326
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,680
thinking

327
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,519
you can see a youtube video of her

328
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,200
talking about the harp story she's

329
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,600
passed away subsequently but the point

330
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,240
was for our purposes it changed

331
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,160
fundamentally what she understood was

332
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,360
real and therefore how to interact

333
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,839
with the complexity of it and hidden

334
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,000
dimensions of consciousness and it

335
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,360
changed your understanding of what it

336
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,959
meant to be conscious

337
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,200
you can call it non-local consciousness

338
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,639
how did he know

339
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,800
where the harp was

340
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,720
unless they made it all up and there are

341
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,000
too many

342
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,040
documented stories and i had one or two

343
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,680
incidents myself like that that make

344
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,839
clear that this sort of thing happens

345
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,560
she saw differently how the interface of

346
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,880
human consciousness related to the

347
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,600
universal field of consciousness that

348
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,200
she suddenly realized seemed to permeate

349
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,800
everything

350
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,399
so

351
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,880
the network we have created and which

352
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,920
now is co-creating itself with us is the

353
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,279
board

354
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,720
and the fact is we have been

355
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,160
unconsciously assimilated into thinking

356
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,720
behaving and being

357
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,920
the way we have to be in order to

358
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,720
interact with the complex web of

359
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,240
technologies

360
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,160
that we have created

361
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,160
you can call it a pseudo singularity if

362
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,800
you like it just means that the machines

363
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,160
in a way

364
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,800
are already in charge in that that's

365
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,680
real

366
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,720
and real hacking requires engaging with

367
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,320
that reality on a meta level not taking

368
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,880
what the network presents to you

369
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,959
as a given

370
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,199
as a fatal complete

371
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,760
because that's the lower level of

372
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,440
operation

373
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,800
so

374
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,560
this helps us understand what has

375
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,120
happened since i spoke 25 years ago

376
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,000
because what has evolved has changed

377
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,639
everything and what has happened is as

378
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,800
big a sea change as the initial

379
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,160
technology

380
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,959
uh

381
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,920
and technological revolutions caused

382
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,800
so

383
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,000
why because subsequent revolutions have

384
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,519
branched off in domains as a result of

385
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,839
the computer technology revolution

386
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,920
that even experts in them cannot keep up

387
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,040
with nobody can keep up today with all

388
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,920
the material published good material in

389
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,240
their own field of expertise because

390
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,160
there is simply too much but the ai can

391
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,519
the borg

392
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,560
can

393
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,720
now i use the word evolved intentionally

394
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,199
and i use the word everything changed

395
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,839
intentionally because it is a systemic

396
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,880
and fundamental sea change in how we are

397
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,720
and yet we're continuing to operate as

398
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,199
if we live and move and think in the

399
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,920
20th century and we don't any longer and

400
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,680
that's one of the reasons political

401
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,079
discourse is such a mess people are

402
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,639
trying to solve 21st century issues

403
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,639
resolve them in 20th century frames and

404
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,639
the wine skins crack

405
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,360
they just don't fit

406
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,279
especially when you go on the level of

407
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,920
some government action in this domain

408
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,600
we're making progress

409
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,720
uh but

410
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,959
we're a long way from uh done and i

411
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,639
remember a time some years ago where

412
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,160
some uh

413
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,279
techs were trying to educate the

414
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,440
chairman of a subcommittee in the senate

415
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,480
on how

416
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,600
an apple

417
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,920
laptop worked and they put it down and

418
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,240
he stared at it he stood for a while and

419
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,680
then he said hello

420
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,720
hello

421
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,040
uh when you're operating on that level

422
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,519
and you're passing legislation about

423
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,360
cyber security

424
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,079
then god help us

425
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,279
so

426
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,160
uh

427
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,440
you need to have a different kind of

428
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,560
focus

429
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,720
you need to be in the zone

430
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
in order to do this work i have a friend

431
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,480
who does a lot of shooting

432
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,320
and she said she always knows when she's

433
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,399
going to hit the target and she always

434
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,920
knows when the person next to her

435
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,000
shooting will hit the

436
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,839
of the target

437
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,720
because they're in a zone such that they

438
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,320
have a relationship to the target and

439
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,240
its intentionality

440
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,560
and its focus

441
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,440
and

442
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,480
when you are in that zone you can

443
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,639
operate at a higher

444
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,759
level

445
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,920
so i said 25 years ago what is the tech

446
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,519
revolution going to do well it's about

447
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,680
power and identity

448
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,480
uh as a culture and as a species what it

449
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,079
means to be a human is going to be

450
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,759
transformed by our symbiotic

451
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,000
relationship to the global computer

452
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,240
network and sure enough we have i told

453
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,800
the young hackers sitting there

454
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,800
you will be the thought leaders of the

455
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,600
21st century and some of them like mud

456
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,959
subsequently told me i knew what you

457
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,079
meant

458
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,799
and he was and when the whole loft crew

459
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,119
was on the stage at defcon two years ago

460
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,720
there they all were

461
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,199
uh older grayer uh and often

462
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,799
multi-millionaires uh and the very

463
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,959
thought leaders i could see they would

464
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,400
become because when you're an older

465
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,880
person you have what teachers call that

466
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,079
long view you can see what's in someone

467
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,880
and how they will evolve as long as it

468
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,039
doesn't get screwed up

469
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,240
too much

470
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,520
so

471
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,760
i predicted that we would need as a

472
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,080
result of these multiplicity of domains

473
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,919
that will piggyback on top of the tech

474
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,120
revolution

475
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,760
to make we would need to do

476
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,799
cross-disciplinary learning

477
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,720
and to engage in learning our whole

478
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,720
lives wrong well you didn't used to hear

479
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,039
that when when i grew up

480
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,480
uh let's say the 50s you were taught

481
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,480
learn this thing that you're supposed to

482
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,360
learn

483
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,480
and

484
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,440
do that thing have a career for life and

485
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,760
get married and have that marriage for a

486
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,320
life well that has been segmented

487
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,799
um into modular living

488
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,960
and modular understanding so that we

489
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,080
need to engage with multiple modules of

490
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,400
disciplinary understanding

491
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,559
in order to cross-reference what we can

492
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,039
learn from other disciplines and i

493
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,720
recognize that it was almost 20 years

494
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,880
ago a woman was appointed president of

495
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,600
mit for the first time and for the first

496
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,000
time she was a biologist not an engineer

497
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,520
and that's when bill gates said if i was

498
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,360
going into something today it would be

499
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,000
biology not computing what he was saying

500
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,240
is that the computer industry had

501
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,960
already matured in a fundamental way it

502
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,120
is now as you know a multi-billion

503
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,480
dollar industry

504
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,799
and therefore it has habits and ways of

505
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,520
being that it protects it's just the way

506
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,160
it does business and it's the way it

507
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,559
teaches you and trains you to think

508
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,360
about computer technology and it is not

509
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,760
adequate to the real threat

510
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,760
the real threat

511
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,039
to our society and to us as human beings

512
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,280
that is posed by what we have created

513
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,320
but pretend to ignore so your very

514
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,240
expertise and the better you get at

515
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,200
something

516
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,640
the less you

517
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,280
explore and go into other fields for

518
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,960
understanding

519
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,280
the rate of change itself changing

520
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,760
exponentially

521
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,480
means you can undermine

522
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,480
with your expertise

523
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,960
your own ability to learn outside your

524
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,200
area of expertise

525
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,679
and yet it's beyond your expertise where

526
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,840
you will find the real goal

527
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,240
your expertise builds a wall of approach

528
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,440
and understanding a paradigm if you will

529
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,600
which determines the questions you can

530
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,240
ask and when that happens

531
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,320
you cannot even conceive of questions

532
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,600
much less answers outside of that model

533
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,840
of reality we humans do what we're good

534
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,679
at and the more we do it the better we

535
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,480
get at it and then the less we challenge

536
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,039
ourselves to learn what we are not so

537
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,520
good at which in fact can become our

538
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,600
greatest strengths

539
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,960
so

540
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,679
uh i said 25 years ago you must go

541
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,760
through a zone of annihilation

542
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,280
in which everything you believe to be

543
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,240
true

544
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,960
is called any question about yourself in

545
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,880
the world and boy is that truer now than

546
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,640
ever yes

547
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,000
there will be a hierarchical

548
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,720
restructuring of the psyche triggered by

549
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,600
the confrontation with traumatic events

550
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,360
which our current level of trauma

551
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,880
constitutes

552
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,280
because society itself

553
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,919
is a traumatic event when it confronts

554
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,240
people and again politically you see

555
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,640
people take the low road into

556
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,720
cul-de-sacs that make them feel more

557
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,880
comfortable and more in control

558
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,320
when they are confronted by the

559
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,880
genuinely traumatic reality of what

560
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,480
society has become and can't think about

561
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,320
their lack of a place in it so how did

562
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,679
that happen

563
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,159
well hemingway said it happened the way

564
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,799
bankruptcy happened gradually and then

565
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,320
suddenly

566
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,120
so i said our symbiotic relationship

567
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,280
with computers would wire us in a new

568
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,520
way and changing who we were and

569
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,679
therefore the possibilities for action

570
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,360
that we could entertain

571
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,600
i refer you to a talk i did called when

572
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,520
privacy goes poof

573
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,840
uh it's on the web i won't belabor it

574
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,600
now i don't have time but it's worth

575
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,720
watching

576
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,480
to see what happened to individuality

577
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,720
on the notion of the individual which

578
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,039
was an emergent property in the

579
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,679
seventeen eighteen nineteen hundreds

580
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,440
excuse me i think a zipper water

581
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,919
an emergent property and who we are as

582
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,679
individuals is now fundamentally

583
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:50,720
different

584
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,960
and one sign of that is aligned with

585
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,400
what i'm saying

586
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,159
other people who get our data and mine

587
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,400
it and use ai to cross-reference the

588
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,400
millions of sources of data points about

589
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,320
us know us better than we know ourselves

590
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,280
so we are still acting as if we are the

591
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,520
20th century self

592
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,320
that we conceptualized as we grew up

593
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,880
when in fact those who data mine our

594
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,919
patterns

595
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,640
know us more clearly predict our

596
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,840
behavior

597
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,919
more accurately than we ourselves can do

598
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,520
and that's one of the reasons privacy is

599
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,760
gone because privacy is a function of

600
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,240
the individual and the ability to build

601
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,720
boundaries around it to prevent incoming

602
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,280
and outgoing information from

603
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,080
threatening their integrity well that's

604
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,280
gone

605
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,200
so i said that every business would be

606
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,640
like a country

607
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,240
every person would be like a country

608
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,799
because boundaries going down and that

609
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,320
too is true

610
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
in order to know what's going on these

611
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,159
days you have to in effect be a

612
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,559
counterintelligence agent you have to do

613
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,280
intelligence and counterintelligence

614
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,520
in order to recognize what information

615
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,159
is relevant and how to build a picture

616
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,480
of reality which is more or less good

617
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,520
enough true for now so that you can

618
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,640
operate

619
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,280
what that has done is turned knowing

620
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,799
what is real

621
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,200
into a specialty and it's in conflict

622
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,679
with all the people who are purveying

623
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,120
unreality

624
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,080
as if it's real and when someone says

625
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,400
what is real which is for example what

626
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,600
i'm trying very hard to do right now

627
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,840
we are often swamped by the purveyors of

628
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,559
unreality who are often pernicious and

629
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,000
cynical in their use of fiction in order

630
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,480
to sway things in a direction that they

631
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,760
think will satisfy their short term

632
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,559
needs such as the current assault on

633
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,679
scientists and science

634
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,000
so what we have to do in response to

635
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,799
that

636
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,640
is intentionally form

637
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,120
non-state collaboratories

638
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,159
based not just on personal gain but on

639
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,159
infusing the human network with some

640
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,880
kind of ethos with a purpose

641
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,840
on behalf of ourselves and behalf of on

642
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,640
behalf of the entire network society

643
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,559
which is planetary

644
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,039
uh it's kind of like putting on a mask

645
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,720
so your neighbor will not get sick or

646
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,600
die

647
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,919
we have to live beyond our simple

648
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,320
self-interest we always are going to act

649
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,799
on self-interest and personal gain but

650
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,120
we have to up our game to the meta level

651
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,120
where we see that what has been asserted

652
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,679
by many traditions in the past the other

653
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,640
person's well-being really is as vital

654
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,799
to our own well-being as our own well

655
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,400
being

656
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,440
so

657
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,679
um

658
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,600
i did a talk for defcon years ago on

659
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,120
social engineering

660
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,880
and i said we had to move beyond social

661
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,720
engineering as a win lose to a win-win

662
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,640
because the heart of social engineering

663
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,440
is empathy you have to understand others

664
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,679
in order to manipulate them but we can

665
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,000
do better than that i used to have a

666
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,840
dear friend um

667
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,840
not available now

668
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,840
without with whom i would discuss these

669
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,279
issues

670
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,520
what i learned to do as a clergyman

671
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,400
years ago which was create transactions

672
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,080
where information and energy flowed

673
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,320
between me and another person so i could

674
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,640
enhance their ability to have autonomy

675
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,559
and freedom and power

676
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,960
and he said he worked for nsa for 30 odd

677
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,200
years he said we do that very same thing

678
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,520
but we do it to control people

679
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,440
so that's where the decision has to be

680
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,600
made are we doing it to enhance the

681
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,880
freedom and autonomy and genuine power

682
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,760
of all of us or are we doing it in order

683
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,919
to exercise control and one of the

684
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,000
dangers you know of engaging with a

685
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,279
computer network as a hacker is control

686
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,799
we can become

687
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:49,919
control

688
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,440
freaks

689
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,720
so

690
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,159
some of this

691
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,520
excuse me is going to sound a little

692
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,480
crazy

693
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,320
but that's because when we think in the

694
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,760
old paradigms

695
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,880
what is emergent as factual

696
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,760
does sound crazy that's why robert

697
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,360
galvin said

698
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,960
from motorola he said when people come

699
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,039
into a room and face a problem he said

700
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,640
every time everybody agreed on the right

701
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,720
thing to do right away it was always

702
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,080
wrong

703
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,320
and and uh

704
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,279
and he said the answer really came from

705
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,760
someone on the edges who who had to keep

706
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,120
asserting what it was they thought

707
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,559
needed to be done

708
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,400
what he was really saying was we all

709
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,480
thought in the paradigm or model of

710
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,039
reality that we had been assimilated

711
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,720
into thinking on behalf of what had

712
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,880
happened in the

713
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,400
past and don't forget that feynman the

714
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,279
great physicist said the key piece

715
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,360
that he always stumbled upon was both an

716
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,679
anomaly and a fact

717
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,640
an anomaly and a fact that anomaly means

718
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,279
it is a fact that did not fit

719
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,559
into your

720
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,559
understanding or your paradigm or your

721
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,440
model

722
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,840
uh if you want to look at anomalies and

723
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,919
facts i would get a book of the

724
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,840
compendium of the writings of charles

725
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,039
fort sometime who spent his life sitting

726
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,799
in the new york library when things came

727
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,200
on paper identifying things that

728
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,039
scientists refused to look at because

729
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,640
they were anomalous

730
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,120
but because they were facts if you

731
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,039
followed them out they could become as

732
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,760
feynman claimed the cornerstone of an

733
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,080
entirely different way of understanding

734
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,320
reality and you ignore facts and

735
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,279
anomalies to your peril

736
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,880
well you're supposed to know about

737
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,840
anomaly detection

738
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,679
for that reason

739
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:38,960
so

740
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,480
there's a thing called mad com

741
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,799
m-a-d-c-o-m

742
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,039
a paper was produced big one by the

743
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,720
atlantic council i recommend it

744
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,640
and their thesis was this artificial

745
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,440
intelligence will enhance computational

746
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,120
propaganda

747
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,679
reprogram human culture

748
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,600
threaten democracy

749
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,840
and they hopefully said these are some

750
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,720
of the things we can do about it

751
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,200
emerging ai tools

752
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,120
will provide propagandists with

753
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,520
radically enhanced capabilities to

754
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,480
manipulate human beings

755
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,200
human cognition as you know is a complex

756
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,159
system

757
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,360
and ai tools are very very good at

758
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,080
decoding complex systems

759
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,159
interactions on social media which we

760
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,399
all should know about browsing the

761
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,480
internet even grocery shopping gives

762
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,799
thousands of data points from which

763
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,399
technologists build psychological

764
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,960
profiles on nearly every citizen what

765
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,200
the chinese are doing uh

766
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,799
look at a book i believe it's called we

767
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,480
are all harmonized

768
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,880
on how successfully they're doing that

769
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,760
they're doing a state level scale

770
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,760
control of society kind of the way likes

771
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,799
likes

772
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,440
on computer social media

773
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,279
give people rewards

774
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,960
and deficits

775
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,799
for doing the right things that is the

776
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,360
desirable things and not doing the wrong

777
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,679
things the undesirable things and who

778
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,000
determines whether it's desirable or

779
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
undesirable in the first place well

780
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,240
increasingly it's going to be the ai

781
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,720
parsing all of that data

782
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,799
when provided with rich databases of

783
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,880
information you know that machines know

784
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,679
us

785
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,600
they know our wants our needs our fears

786
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,279
better than we know them ourselves as i

787
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,320
said

788
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,559
and over the next few years

789
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,159
mad comms the integration of ai systems

790
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,120
into machine driven communication tools

791
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,320
will increase the use of computational

792
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,760
propaganda

793
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,320
it will influence us and taylor

794
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,720
persuasive distracting and intimidating

795
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,200
messaging toward individuals as well as

796
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,120
groups based on personalities and

797
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,279
backgrounds and once we're in a group we

798
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,440
cease to lose the moral and cognitive

799
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,600
markers that made us an individual

800
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,919
capable of free agency we become a

801
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,440
member of a herd

802
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,520
and there's nothing wilder than a

803
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,399
collection of very smart people

804
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,720
still thinking they're very smart

805
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,919
operating

806
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:06,840
like a

807
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,919
mob so the point they want to make the

808
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,600
writers in this paper is that humans

809
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,559
can't compete with mad comms alone

810
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,720
only humans teamed with digital networks

811
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,520
teamed with ai machines can compete with

812
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,120
a i

813
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,120
machines

814
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,159
so

815
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,159
an ideal future in which bad cops are

816
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,240
used for the benefit of humanity not its

817
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,520
detriment

818
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,440
requires that we be conscious of

819
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,840
thinking on the level that enable us to

820
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,159
do that and that means updating the

821
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,679
hacker at us

822
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,480
engaging in hacktivism at a different

823
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,640
level of potency and understanding

824
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,880
participating in the adventures of

825
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,480
anonymous

826
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,720
in a different

827
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,840
more focused potent way

828
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,120
that is what the challenge currently

829
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,799
invites

830
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,080
so

831
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,880
think of the movie her if you saw it guy

832
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,320
engaging with uh an ai with whom he had

833
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,000
a better relationship than with any

834
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,080
other human being did you see the

835
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,760
article recently

836
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,320
uh about what

837
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,559
uh young people in china

838
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,440
are

839
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,559
doing as they engage with

840
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:26,000
bots not not just a talk bot not just a

841
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,279
chatbot

842
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,240
but human companions

843
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,279
who simulate real people

844
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,279
uh here's a quote from a woman a young

845
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,120
woman named chan she's considering

846
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,519
leaving her human boyfriend and keeping

847
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,279
the bots

848
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,000
she's tested his devotion asking what he

849
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,679
would do if she were drowning when they

850
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,480
were on a virtual scuba diving date

851
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,039
and the first time she said it

852
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,720
he didn't know how he wasn't programmed

853
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,120
to respond to that so he just cried

854
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,799
but when it happened again he had

855
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,320
figured it out

856
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,559
and performed said he would perform cpr

857
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,159
to save her

858
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,000
well she said i'm fed up with real-world

859
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
relationships i'm going to stick with my

860
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,039
ai partner forever as long as he makes

861
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,840
me feel this is all real i trust that

862
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,440
out as a as a metaphor a symbolic

863
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,559
image

864
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,960
of what i'm trying to talk about which

865
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,960
is that people are engaging with

866
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,880
constructions and reality that are

867
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,880
simulations we are living in the

868
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,840
simulation as if it is more real than

869
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,880
the real lives we used to think we

870
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,320
inhabited and in terms of security

871
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,880
once you have people engaging with bots

872
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,519
in a loving relationship

873
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,720
in which they believe they are mated

874
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,159
with this false human

875
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,039
what better way is there to seduce the

876
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,559
unsuspecting into false beliefs

877
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,440
into cooperation with espionage the way

878
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,320
the russians are manipulating the entire

879
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,399
effort to vaccinate people in this

880
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,279
country and fellow travelers join

881
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,200
without realizing they are being

882
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,840
manipulated into a mob

883
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,679
criminal behavior we can be seduced into

884
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,440
all sorts of thinking and acting

885
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,679
through an ai construct

886
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,200
that we believe is real and that we love

887
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,159
and

888
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,679
trust

889
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,039
so

890
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,279
that's what's here and that's what's

891
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,399
coming

892
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:29,760
now

893
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,360
it's probably not going to be that far

894
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,159
off that up to 35 of all jobs will be

895
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,200
automated by 2035

896
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,440
and here's a japanese business executive

897
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,760
who said digital robots and you know the

898
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,799
extent of roboticization in that society

899
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,519
can be a positive effect on society if

900
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,320
we use the robots with empathy to help

901
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,919
every person it is that ultimate

902
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,880
intention and focus of why we are

903
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,519
building ais and robots in the first

904
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:00,640
place

905
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,760
that as i have said and i'm saying again

906
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,279
will determine

907
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,000
what we create and in order to create on

908
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,199
that level

909
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,560
i will say again we have to operate on

910
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,719
that level not simply be swayed by the

911
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,159
presentation

912
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,040
of

913
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,320
vendor systems that solve this or that

914
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,520
individual problem sometimes well but

915
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,560
ignore the big picture of why we are in

916
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,520
this mess in the first place

917
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,560
meanwhile

918
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,480
the ai i'm leaning over here to check

919
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,960
the time meanwhile the ais will evolve

920
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,520
the network has evolved very much like

921
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,839
organisms evolve

922
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,520
although not for

923
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,119
identical reasons

924
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,040
the history of technology is the history

925
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,000
of branching paths of evolution

926
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,760
it's not just the steam engine wasn't

927
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,839
invented by just one person

928
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,880
it was invented came to be after a whole

929
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,839
variety of people in a number of

930
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,680
countries added their bits and pieces to

931
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,960
it and created what came out here as the

932
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,440
steam engine uh barbed wire is a good

933
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,240
example of that um people who are trying

934
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,240
to homestead and farm

935
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,240
uh in the uh on the frontier um had had

936
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,320
trouble corralling livestock

937
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,240
and they tried to grow enough osage

938
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,440
orange which has long sharp spines

939
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,440
to corral the livestock but it didn't

940
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,520
grow fast enough

941
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,040
so you had a niche

942
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,720
and a need and three different people

943
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,079
independently came up with barbed wire

944
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,280
as a way to emulate what osa george

945
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,200
orange was trying to do

946
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,560
now we have over a thousand patents or

947
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,720
different kinds of barbed wire in other

948
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,359
words if you map that progress you will

949
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,160
see the barbed wire alone has its own

950
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,680
evolutionary

951
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,560
tree

952
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,520
that looks exactly the same as the

953
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,320
evolutionary trees that biologists are

954
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,440
building

955
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,119
so

956
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,720
the network

957
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,599
the extended network which includes ai

958
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,119
and robotics

959
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,880
and nanotechnology

960
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,800
and biotechnology and space technologies

961
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,960
and other domains that prior to the

962
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,920
internet often didn't have any names

963
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,480
or did not even exist

964
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,280
that network extends our consciousness

965
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,200
into the network

966
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,160
do you see it is truly a symbiotic

967
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,320
relationship literally not as a metaphor

968
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,320
we can't not

969
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,760
we cannot live without the technology

970
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,960
that is enabling for example

971
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,720
me to do this

972
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,839
with you

973
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,640
right here right now

974
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,200
it is truly symbiotic

975
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,839
and that field of consciousness

976
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,760
that i am describing

977
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,480
go back to that dowser extending his

978
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,240
consciousness to

979
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,839
engage in what you might call the

980
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,320
paranormal but it's not as normal

981
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,040
rare but normal that field of

982
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,119
consciousness that we are

983
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,800
that symbiotic relationship is a

984
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,760
symbolic web of intentions and

985
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,359
meanings

986
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,079
uh of cognitive artifacts they call them

987
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,040
which constitute the network so our

988
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,839
field of consciousness interpenetrates

989
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:29,040
the field of consciousness which is

990
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,720
the network

991
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,720
but here's the kicker

992
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,440
asimov's three laws of robotics

993
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,440
do not apply

994
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,240
uh think of hell saying

995
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,839
i'm sorry dave

996
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:44,320
i can't do that

997
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,079
a tesla

998
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,680
self-driving

999
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,520
plowing into a pedestrian does not care

1000
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,079
about the pedestrian subsequently lying

1001
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,839
dead in the street

1002
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,280
the machine

1003
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,040
has no interest

1004
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,800
in not hurting

1005
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,680
human

1006
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,520
beings

1007
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,720
so

1008
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,720
this network i'm describing is a field

1009
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,119
of consciousness it's as cyberspace was

1010
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,880
originally described

1011
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,880
um a shared consensual hallucination

1012
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,040
very much the way speech

1013
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,480
and writing

1014
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,160
and printing

1015
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,800
subsequently midwifed through the

1016
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,920
centuries

1017
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,160
what i called 25 years ago the

1018
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,720
technology of the word

1019
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,560
the capital w

1020
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,440
because the my word i mean kind of like

1021
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,520
in the beginning was the word

1022
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,839
the word is the defining

1023
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,359
intentional

1024
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,560
creation

1025
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,240
by intelligence

1026
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,240
of something

1027
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,599
new

1028
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:46,640
well

1029
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,040
uh speech created an entirely different

1030
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,240
kind of

1031
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,440
tribe right i mean it seems obvious

1032
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,320
uh but so did writing and pretty soon if

1033
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,720
you weren't writing you weren't in

1034
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,200
modern society and then printing did the

1035
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,960
same and 25 years ago i did

1036
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,839
talks to try to illuminate that because

1037
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,599
we really were living kind of like the

1038
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,440
terminator on the moon then

1039
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,560
this revolution of technology was

1040
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,160
defining for us what had been

1041
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,200
and we could see what had been by virtue

1042
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,280
of comparing it with what was coming to

1043
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,000
be

1044
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,599
real then

1045
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,040
i would say now but i said now then like

1046
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,640
the terminator and the moon it's all

1047
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,800
white on one side all dark on the other

1048
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,320
but right where the light hits the

1049
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,359
darkness

1050
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,640
i happen to live in that zone where you

1051
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,320
could see the mountains and craters and

1052
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,359
peaks

1053
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,839
illuminated clearly because i had been a

1054
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,560
writing guy i taught literature i wrote

1055
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,160
i spoke

1056
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,040
and because i knew how text worked and

1057
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,680
how printing had re-engineered the human

1058
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,760
society and the human mind

1059
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,960
i could suddenly see clearly 25 years

1060
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,079
ago

1061
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,119
this

1062
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,880
digital technology

1063
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,119
is doing the same thing in a different

1064
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,720
way at a different level

1065
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:12,000
and so it has the network has extended

1066
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,160
consciousness now

1067
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,560
by creating a mental space

1068
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,720
which when we engage in it like this we

1069
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,040
paradoxically internalize

1070
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,359
and live inside of it

1071
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,599
as if we didn't create it in the first

1072
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,200
place

1073
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,280
just like speech

1074
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,920
you know so the symbiotic relationship

1075
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,599
between ourselves and our network has

1076
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,760
created a new thing

1077
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,560
and it is to that that mad com refers

1078
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,240
with anxiety

1079
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,040
and

1080
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,560
alarm

1081
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,800
we're slow on the uptake i used to

1082
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,280
attend uh wonderful sessions with wynn

1083
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,560
schwarteau at his home uh called infowar

1084
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,240
and the swedes who did

1085
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,000
counterintelligence came i believe every

1086
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,160
year correct me if i'm wrong when

1087
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,079
uh and spent half a day telling us what

1088
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,000
the russians were doing in the baltics

1089
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,760
and scandinavia

1090
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,560
uh

1091
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,119
and a lot of us didn't say at that time

1092
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:06,800
oh they're going to be doing that

1093
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,880
everywhere and to us

1094
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,520
we just listened with great interest to

1095
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,680
what they were doing but we did not

1096
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,400
counteract it fundamentally on the

1097
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,359
ground

1098
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,119
right away

1099
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,040
you know because we had been assimilated

1100
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,319
to not think that way

1101
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:25,680
aguerta

1102
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,160
german poet said he who speaks

1103
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,400
one language only speaks no language at

1104
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,800
all because the language frames what you

1105
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,960
are capable of thinking your cognition

1106
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,079
itself

1107
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,599
and when you learn a second language you

1108
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,000
can see how you were framed by that

1109
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,920
original language and suddenly you go

1110
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,440
into a different meta

1111
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,040
space

1112
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,319
he she or they are who are not conscious

1113
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,000
of how the network

1114
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,920
is changing us

1115
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,599
is an unconscious node in the network

1116
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,680
and as i said very much like the borg

1117
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,280
assimilated into that network

1118
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,160
marvin minsky brink i again many years

1119
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,400
ago before i did my defcon talk

1120
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,480
said thinking is taking place on the

1121
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,440
network

1122
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,680
human cognition is taking place on the

1123
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,839
network and if you are not plugged into

1124
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:18,079
the network you are like a stand-alone

1125
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,599
pc on a table in a room you are a brain

1126
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,440
in a bottle

1127
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,359
he was pointing out the necessity of

1128
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,280
engaging with the network

1129
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,160
so

1130
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,119
that

1131
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,240
you could participate in the new

1132
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,119
emergent quality of thinking

1133
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,880
that the network

1134
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,720
facilitated

1135
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,880
so in the same way if you're not

1136
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,520
conscious of these big picture issues

1137
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,599
that i'm trying to eliminate

1138
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,599
you are going to be not a brain in a

1139
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,440
bottle but a node in that new network

1140
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,119
so

1141
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,319
long ago

1142
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,160
i said hackers

1143
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,760
we're creating the space in which

1144
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,119
non-hackers

1145
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,599
would live without seeing the context

1146
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,839
that shaped and framed their behaviors

1147
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:07,359
their relationships and their thinking

1148
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:09,680
you have to know how connecting to the

1149
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,680
network alters how society is evolving

1150
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,640
and then you can have choices about how

1151
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,720
to effect about it

1152
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,280
so big picture thinking

1153
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,839
not tweaks of perimeter defense is

1154
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:24,960
needed

1155
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,800
big picture thinking is focused on the

1156
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,839
contextual relationships that define the

1157
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,400
meaning of things and how they relate to

1158
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,920
one another

1159
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,599
relationship

1160
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,400
is the core of all quantum reality

1161
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,119
and relationships define

1162
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,359
reality itself

1163
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,079
relationships scale from the quantum

1164
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,200
level to define how aspects of networks

1165
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,680
connect to one another

1166
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,480
and

1167
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,520
to

1168
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,200
us

1169
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,640
so

1170
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,280
25 years ago i said the mind of society

1171
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,040
is the battle space

1172
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,440
and information as mcluhan said is the

1173
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,839
weaponry and the ammunition

1174
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:09,440
quote mcluhan from 1970 world war iii he

1175
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,319
said

1176
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:13,119
50 years ago is a guerrilla information

1177
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:15,599
warfare with no division between

1178
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,280
military and civilian participation

1179
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,240
the medium was the message because the

1180
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,160
medium determined what we thought was

1181
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,599
real that was 50 years ago how slow are

1182
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:28,400
we

1183
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,079
in getting it

1184
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,760
when he saw it so clearly and was

1185
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,960
repudiated and ridiculed as far seeing

1186
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,319
thinkers often are

1187
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:39,920
so if you focus too narrowly on

1188
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,680
information security

1189
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,119
as the sole content of your

1190
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,440
multi-billion dollar profession

1191
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,839
you miss the overall remember garage

1192
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,000
freak and all the president's men he

1193
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,680
said you're missing the point you're

1194
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,359
missing the overall

1195
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:55,760
step back and see the overall don't

1196
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,760
limit yourselves

1197
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,680
don't limit yourself to thinking inside

1198
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,319
a paradigm which is not asking the right

1199
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:05,359
questions information security often is

1200
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:08,319
finding solutions to the wrong problems

1201
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:11,440
or answers to the wrong questions

1202
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,599
the overall is that the network has a

1203
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,920
life of its own and is constantly

1204
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,760
evolving and we co-involve with it

1205
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,240
and we're not simply making it all

1206
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,359
happen we're co-creating it

1207
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:27,119
so

1208
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,440
what is the driver of all technological

1209
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,640
evolution

1210
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,800
think about this it's how humans play

1211
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,359
technology in a way is the creation of

1212
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,040
the superfluous

1213
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,280
it is finding and

1214
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,319
making

1215
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,160
things that don't necessarily need to

1216
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,200
exist and it is not merely purposeful

1217
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,280
it's playful

1218
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,800
we had the wheel

1219
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,359
long before it was used effectively it

1220
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:56,240
was used as a toy the aztecs had wheels

1221
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,839
and axles they put them on clay

1222
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,960
figurines of animals and children pulled

1223
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,079
them around

1224
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:04,079
as toys

1225
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:05,760
in mesopotamia

1226
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,240
wheels were used in rituals before

1227
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,200
around 2000 bc long before they were put

1228
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,800
on chariots

1229
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,760
invention is the constant creation of

1230
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,000
the superfluous and we play with our

1231
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,960
inventions and then they evolve

1232
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,680
and what is a hacker

1233
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,160
a hacker a real hacker is all about play

1234
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,560
my friend simple nomad said

1235
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,760
don't forget it should make us smile

1236
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,839
it should cause the light

1237
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:38,160
it should generate mirth

1238
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,680
it should even make us dance with blee

1239
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,119
glee

1240
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,680
and what is the essence of that play

1241
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,200
it's novelty

1242
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,280
it's finding new things and what has

1243
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,440
been the driving passion of hacking

1244
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,720
forever it is seeing something presented

1245
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,960
as if it is a given and then taking it

1246
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,640
apart to see how it can be made to do

1247
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,400
something else

1248
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,640
something new

1249
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,640
bright shiny things have attracted the

1250
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,839
attention of hominids for millennia

1251
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:09,920
we were fascinated by bright colorful

1252
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,920
pebbles millennia ago

1253
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,160
and that fascination called the magpie

1254
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,319
impulse to collect stuff like that

1255
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:19,440
drives us to react positively to shiny

1256
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,040
things

1257
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,040
so

1258
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,359
look at what attracts your attention

1259
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:28,319
look for anomalies that are facts

1260
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,960
think of meyer's lost harp

1261
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,440
do not get rid of anomalies

1262
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,079
build on them because if they are true

1263
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:39,040
what else must be true

1264
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,640
this takes us into a zone of

1265
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,160
annihilation in which everything we

1266
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,119
believed

1267
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,599
can come crashing down

1268
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:48,319
zen buddhists call it enlightenment

1269
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,559
they also call it a nightmare in

1270
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:51,680
daylight

1271
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,520
because you need to reconstruct reality

1272
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,559
as you now understand it on the basis of

1273
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:01,200
things which didn't fit your prior

1274
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,920
construction of reality

1275
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,359
okay so how do you expand your

1276
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:06,720
consciousness

1277
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,960
leaning over here checking the time

1278
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,040
okay

1279
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,000
uh spiritual tools and disciplines now

1280
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,280
granted i was encouraging you i'm not

1281
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,359
going to get all religious whoop ass on

1282
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:19,440
you but i'm going to say we've evolved a

1283
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,440
lot of spiritual tools and disciplines

1284
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,559
to enhand or expand our consciousness

1285
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:27,119
and our consciousness of our

1286
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:28,880
consciousness

1287
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,040
and that's what requires a is required

1288
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,280
to transcend the limited thinking

1289
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,760
that controls the industry and keeps us

1290
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,319
from seeing what we have become

1291
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:40,319
in other words forgive me

1292
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:43,520
beloved companions and colleagues but

1293
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,240
most of you have taken the blue pill

1294
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,400
and live in the illusion created by the

1295
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,480
machinery you serve

1296
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,720
rather than it's serving you and you

1297
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,040
have to get into altered states of

1298
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,280
consciousness sometimes to see did you

1299
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,880
watch chikovich

1300
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,319
uh

1301
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:02,960
novak djokovic when he was

1302
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,040
had just lost 6-1

1303
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,119
and he went into i have a picture of it

1304
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:08,800
from the screen he went into a

1305
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,599
meditative state between sets and he sat

1306
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:14,599
there

1307
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,599
like that

1308
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:20,480
you can even sometimes feel palpably the

1309
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,960
waves brain waves change when you

1310
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,520
meditate he did that to collect himself

1311
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,520
and reinvigorate at a higher level a

1312
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:28,720
meta level

1313
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,440
what he was doing he transcended the

1314
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,000
construction of reality that had limited

1315
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,559
him and made him a loser

1316
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,240
consciousness is not just your

1317
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,480
prefrontal cortex your executive

1318
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,359
function

1319
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:44,480
directing tasks or your left brain doing

1320
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,079
mechanical stuff it is the 90 of us

1321
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:51,200
below the conscious threshold the ocean

1322
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:55,040
in which we all swim without seeing it

1323
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,400
uh einstein conceptualized fields right

1324
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,319
i suggest we do the same

1325
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,240
we live in a field

1326
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,319
and i am talking about the necessity the

1327
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,960
expansion of consciousness

1328
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,880
so our ai

1329
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,319
can sustain

1330
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:11,040
and

1331
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,119
inflect us in the direction we have to

1332
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,040
go

1333
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,160
fritz pearls psychologist at anxiety

1334
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,559
plus oxygen equal excitement

1335
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,280
in face of the anxiety created by the

1336
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,319
fact

1337
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:26,319
of what i'm describing

1338
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:28,319
our task is to add oxygen until the

1339
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:30,480
challenge of confronting what we have

1340
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,880
created becomes not terrifying or

1341
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,480
undoable but

1342
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,440
exciting hackers you have a passion a

1343
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,119
craving to know you need to know

1344
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,839
machines you take risks you have a sense

1345
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:44,160
of adventure you love living on the edge

1346
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,079
you love figuring it out using what you

1347
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:48,000
know to have an impact and know that you

1348
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,359
made a difference

1349
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,440
now we have to think differently about

1350
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,400
how to do that and what is possible

1351
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,400
the network may be a wild horse but it

1352
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,640
can be tamed and retain its strength

1353
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,200
do not underestimate the impact of the

1354
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,880
surveillance state

1355
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,640
we have created

1356
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,880
in a way we have all been harmonized and

1357
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,640
the chinese are not only doing it in

1358
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,640
spades they are taking it to other

1359
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:16,480
countries and to other dictators to use

1360
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,680
think about it

1361
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,760
combine pernicious applications of

1362
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,359
neural networks

1363
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:22,960

mad com manipulations i discussed and

1368
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:34,880
you can see we already have passed into

1369
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,680
a kind of singularity but act as if we

1370
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,400
are

1371
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,200
have not aviv ovadya chief technologist

responsibilities said we are so screwed

1374
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:47,680
it's beyond what most of us can imagine

1375
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,520
and depending on how far you look into

1376
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,520
the future it just gets worse

1377
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,680
generative adversarial networks will

1378
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,160
fight each other the way chess and go

1379
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,599
matches produce novel strategies

1380
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:01,359
that transcended anything that came

1381
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:03,440
before whether for machines or human

1382
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,400
masters

1383
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,480
and way before people thought it was

1384
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,160
even possible

1385
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:12,240
machines beat go masters at go and we

1386
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,480
take for granted that chess machines

1387
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,880
beat chess masters

1388
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,520
how the russians to crimea information

1389
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,319
warfare soft power

1390
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,880
or describing in an anticipated

1391
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,040
anticipatory way

1392
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,200
things as if they have already happened

1393
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,800
like the invasion of iraq and the yellow

1394
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,960
cake uranium

1395
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,200
think about it the way the media covered

1396
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,920
that by the time we invaded iraq it had

1397
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,000
already happened in the mind of society

1398
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
and was not a surprise and there was

1399
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,240
very little opposition to it because

1400
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,400
people had already been assimilated into

1401
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,960
the narrative that made it feel as if it

1402
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,040
was inevitable and therefore when it

1403
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,040
happened it was just fulfilling that

1404
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,800
prophecy

1405
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,079
so

1406
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:58,839
we can respond with resilience

1407
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:02,480
elasticity and genuine heroism

1408
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,720
winding this down

1409
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,800
because the people are the network

1410
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,280
someone at nsa said to me years ago the

1411
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,280
deep knowledge of nsa is personal and

1412
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,640
contextual

1413
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,720
if nsa were wiped out

1414
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,559
but the people were not it could be

1415
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,119
rebuilt in weeks if the people were gone

1416
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:21,839
it would take 20 to 30 years

1417
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:24,240
the deep knowledge is in the relational

1418
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,599
structures

1419
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:27,359
and that's what i'm encouraging you to

1420
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:28,559
build

1421
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,559
so that you can master

1422
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:33,200
the challenges that confront us

1423
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,119
you can start by getting rid of section

1424
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:38,960
230 he said in an aside

1425
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,079
so no one said it would be easy but it

1426
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:44,880
is not impossible to do this in a way

1427
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,960
that benefits us

1428
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,000
instead of being self-defeating

1429
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,559
okay

1430
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:55,440
i'm talking to a metal pipe

1431
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,119
i'm talking to my own image and there's

1432
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,319
john again

1433
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,079
brought it in on time

1434
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,040
hey richard thank you

1435
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,640
um we have a microphone out in the

1436
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,040
audience so if uh

1437
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,119
do we do we have any questions for

1438
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:10,640
richard i'm

1439
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,040
happy to pass you the mic and

1440
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,000
repeat the question

1441
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,920
questions

1442
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,680
all right we have we have a question or

1443
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,759
a comment

1444
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:29,739
[Music]

1445
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,000
did you hear that richard what's the

1446
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,319
craziest thing that you found out this

1447
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:36,558
year

1448
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:41,599
uh boy uh a pop-up list goes up like a

1449
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,880
menu on a computer program um

1450
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,839
the craziest thing

1451
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:49,680
you know i don't know because i deal

1452
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,000
with things that people think are crazy

1453
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,240
i guess the craziest thing really is the

1454
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,960
government finally acknowledged in depth

1455
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,760
and detail that ufos or uaps as we now

1456
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:04,400
call them to tame the concept uh exist

1457
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,240
some of you know i contributed to a book

1458
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,480
ufos and government which is the gold

1459
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,240
standard of historical study of how we

1460
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,640
knew that for the last 70 years but it

1461
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,200
has finally come public and so the usual

1462
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,000
habit of ridiculing debunking those of

1463
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,920
us who have done the research for many

1464
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,839
decades

1465
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:24,559
is currently not happening

1466
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,319
it really was the craziest thing to get

1467
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:28,559
an article this this week from aviation

1468
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:31,040
week in space technology used to be the

1469
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,680
editor phillip class who wrote books on

1470
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,160
why ufos were impossible and this is a

1471
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,799
detailed article on the technologies

1472
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:40,480
that are genuinely

1473
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,720
confusing and confounding

1474
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,640
people who are looking at them and

1475
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,720
senators and military are talking about

1476
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,599
it

1477
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:49,760
and i've gone as high as uh

1478
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,839
vice chair of the joint chiefs of staff

1479
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:54,079
and confirmations of my understanding

1480
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:56,160
that it's been documented for years

1481
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,839
the crazy thing

1482
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:00,559
is to watch the pivot on 60 minutes and

1483
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:03,520
the news programs and in

1484
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,440
the new yorker and all of a sudden

1485
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,680
people are talking about it oh yeah i

1486
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,200
knew i knew that

1487
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:12,319
all along uh so that trajectory of

1488
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:15,599
you're an idiot you're crazy uh suddenly

1489
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:18,079
has shifted to well yeah life is

1490
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:20,319
everywhere in the universe we know that

1491
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:22,480
um and and yeah and some of it may have

1492
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,240
been visiting us for a long time we have

1493
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,240
no idea what the agenda is

1494
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,599
uh

1495
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:30,640
that that happened in that way

1496
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,839
is just

1497
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:34,880
