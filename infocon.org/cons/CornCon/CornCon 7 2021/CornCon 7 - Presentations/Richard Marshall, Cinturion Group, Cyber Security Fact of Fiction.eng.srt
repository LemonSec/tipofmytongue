15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,480
wait until i finish my

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,360
quote presentation to ask questions

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,079
i usually deliver my comments on a

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,040
seminar style and walk around

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,520
but because of the uh limitations

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,280
associated with the company

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,000
i guess i'm relegated to

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,160
you

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:53,280
well

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,399
well i'm up here now so just get the mic

25
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,719
one closer

26
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,520
i'm going to say a few things that are

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,000
controversial

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,119
and uh i may upset

29
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,720
some of you in the audience or i may

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,320
upset some of your friends or some of

31
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,920
your business colleagues

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,840
but i have a tendency to tell it like it

33
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,880
is

34
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,799
and then i'll go through some

35
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,159
other practical

36
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,079
uh commentary

37
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,079
that you might find hopefully that

38
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,759
you'll find useful

39
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,640
so let's uh

40
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,040
all right let me

41
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,280
start out again

42
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,560
with commenting that today

43
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,640
when i woke up this morning

44
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,280
i was reminded of where i was

45
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,640
early

46
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,399
20 years ago

47
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,079
at that time i was working in the white

48
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,200
house

49
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,239
on cyber security related issues and i

50
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,160
was asked

51
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,520
previously

52
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,120
to go to nsa to give a presentation to

53
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,959
25 to 30 dignitaries who were associated

54
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,720
with the cyber security centers of

55
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,560
excellence this was a number of schools

56
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,080
across the country

57
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,239
that nsa and later the department of

58
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,800
homeland security sponsored

59
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,239
to help

60
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,920
college students

61
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,120
get involved in cyber security

62
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,200
and many of them once they graduated

63
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,120
from that program would come to work for

64
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,680
the government

65
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,400
nsa used it as a recruiting tool

66
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,160
very successfully

67
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,080
but other federal agencies use it as

68
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,120
well

69
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,680
although most of the money came from uh

70
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,599
nsa appropriations

71
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,680
it was a quite a quite an achievement

72
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,440
quite an accomplishment

73
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,680
so there i was on stage giving my

74
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,599
presentation

75
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,159
and i was no more than two or three

76
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,319
minutes into the presentation talking

77
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,360
about protecting the nation's critical

78
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,760
infrastructure which as we know was all

79
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,360
cyber

80
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,120
and my handwritten said please stop

81
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,239
and open the curtains

82
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,319
i stopped they opened the curtains

83
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,959
and they were showing the pictures

84
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,879
of the world train center being attacked

85
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,440
everyone in the audience thought that

86
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,480
was part of my presentation

87
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,400
they did not realize it was real

88
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,560
so i thought of that this morning and i

89
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,920
know all of you thought about this

90
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,040
morning as well in some particular way

91
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,519
but today is a very special day for all

92
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,280
of us

93
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,319
all right

94
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,080
um

95
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,720
this is a list of my background

96
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,239
so some of the things i'm going to talk

97
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,799
about is sounding like as my kids say

98
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,400
dad you're just a talking history

99
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,439
channel

100
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,920
and that's okay because

101
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,239
a lot of where we are today is because

102
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,280
of where we started several years ago

103
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,640
with

104
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,400
not the greatest generation but my

105
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,920
generation

106
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,079
uh it was an al gore that had been at

107
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,279
the internet

108
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,160
uh it was done before him

109
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,280
but a lot of the

110
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,560
progress that we enjoy today

111
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,720
is a result of some of the mistakes that

112
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,040
we made many years ago

113
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,080
now later today you're going to hear

114
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,960
i think the the last speaker today

115
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,520
is a very dear friend of mine ira

116
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,479
and we were speaking last week

117
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,639
at a virtual conference richard was also

118
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,560
on that virtual conference

119
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,479
and one of the things that

120
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,199
impressed me about ira's presentation

121
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,160
was he talked about left of moon and

122
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,600
rider boom

123
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,919
and he further went to explain what the

124
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,440
difference is

125
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,759
left and boom is what you do to prevent

126
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,199
a problem

127
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,440
right the boom is what you do

128
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,280
to correct the mistakes that have

129
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,479
happened

130
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,960
so i want to talk a little bit about

131
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,120
left of boom

132
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,919
now in order to get there i want to kind

133
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,000
of set some things up

134
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,199
my major job is to run a billion dollar

135
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,800
company in the middle east called

136
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,360
centurion

137
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,440
we're putting in a new fiber optic cable

138
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,680
system from europe

139
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,680
through nine countries

140
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,520
in saudi arabia it includes saudi arabia

141
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,840
going to pakistan india and singapore

142
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,759
never been

143
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,680
done

144
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,440
most of the people in this region did

145
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,000
not get along until recently

146
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
but i'm really proud to say that i've

147
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,800
got

148
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,479
saudis on my board

149
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,240
and israelis on my board and one of my

150
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,720
business partners is israeli

151
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,120
and they get along they talk to each

152
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,000
other

153
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,680
pleasantly

154
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,600
that's progress

155
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
now the reason i'm sharing this with you

156
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,199
is not to talk about centurion

157
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,440
but to emphasize the fact

158
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,319
that the whole world is connected with

159
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,960
undersea cables

160
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,400
undersea cables are not new

161
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,479
the first undersea cable was laid in

162
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,440
1855

163
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,080
now it wasn't fiber optic

164
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,919
it was telegraph

165
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,319
but the point i want to make is that we

166
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,280
are all connected around the world

167
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,319
much closer than we ever have been

168
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,759
instantaneously our adversaries can

169
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,680
reach us

170
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,360
and instantaneously they do

171
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,720
and that's something that we have to

172
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,080
deal with over and over and over again

173
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,000
it's not just somebody that's a close

174
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,840
hacker

175
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,400
they are attacking us from everywhere

176
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
there's electricity

177
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,960
and part of the reason they can do that

178
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,680
is not just because of the massive

179
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,919
telecommunication links we enjoy today

180
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,840
but we've also been the author of our

181
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,440
own misery

182
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,280
and here's what i mean by that

183
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,840
the cyber security industry

184
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,360
and i'm going to

185
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,199
back off a little bit and using that

186
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,800
term i'm just going to focus on the

187
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,960
software industry

188
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,080
those who make software

189
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,280
formally

190
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,560
and currently

191
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,840
are a protected entity

192
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,000
they beta test customers we're the

193
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,039
customers they beta test us

194
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,039
because the software they put out to

195
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,280
market is not foolproof it's not

196
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,199
bulletproof

197
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,440
and as an emphasis of that

198
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,960
every

199
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,120
first tuesday of every month

200
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,120
a major software developer by the name

201
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,840
of microsoft to their

202
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,039
credit puts out a list of

203
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,479
vulnerabilities that need to be

204
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,919
corrected

205
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,639
now that's a wonderful step forward

206
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,560
but it's not enough

207
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,960
because most of the entities that get

208
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,080
that list of vulnerabilities to check

209
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,360
and correct

210
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,879
as richard said earlier the other

211
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,039
reasons i said earlier today

212
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,199
don't do it

213
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,720
they don't do it because it's time

214
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,160
consuming

215
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,840
it's expensive

216
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,520
and they're really not sure how the

217
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,759
patches interact with their systems that

218
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,680
they currently are running

219
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,280
and this is particularly true of the

220
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,919
financial services sector

221
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,159
they're not sure until they run a series

222
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,839
of tests

223
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,839
that the vulnerabilities that have been

224
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,240
identified to be corrected

225
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,240
that the source code that microsoft

226
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,360
provides

227
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,920
will correct it without disrupting their

228
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,839
current system

229
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,839
and the other factor is just basic

230
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,440
economics the financial services sector

231
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,760
is in business shockingly enough to make

232
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,279
money

233
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,640
and if it's cheaper to absorb an attack

234
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,120
rather than take precautionary

235
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,600
measures to prevent the attack

236
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,120
guess which wins

237
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,959
the bait counter

238
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,959
and that's one of the reasons i advocate

239
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,920
never let a cfo be your ceo

240
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,760
they're too worried about money rather

241
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,279
than trying to get the job done

242
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,279
effectively

243
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,399
a related issue monoculture

244
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,440
most

245
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,320
entities in the world

246
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,480
use microsoft

247
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,000
now i'm not an anti-microsoft individual

248
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,839
a lot of places use

249
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,839
oracle

250
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,760
i use

251
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,279
microsoft i use oracle and i'm a big mac

252
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,600
user as well

253
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,519
but the problem is microsoft is so

254
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,640
embedded

255
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,080
in china

256
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,519
and russia

257
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,360
and other countries that we won't

258
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,040
mention but those are the two primary

259
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,399
ones

260
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,640
they know microsoft better than we do

261
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,240
because they have a lot of people that

262
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,720
are very very smart they spend a lot of

263
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,519
time

264
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,480
trying to break in and modify and hack

265
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,279
microsoft and they return that to us

266
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,000
when they hack us

267
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,800
we need to change that

268
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,560
the only way we're going to change that

269
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,279
protected industry two ways

270
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,519
one is legislation

271
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,279
and we have to remember we have the best

272
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,480
congress

273
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,560
representatives that money can buy

274
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,880
and a lot of the money that buys them

275
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,200
comes from the northwest

276
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,360
uh right into that microsoft if you want

277
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,600
to and i'm not being disparate of

278
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,120
microsoft i'm just pointing out in

279
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,440
reality

280
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,920
congress is not interested in changing

281
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,440
this issue

282
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,399
because they are not directly affected

283
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,399
and it would disrupt their

284
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,120
pay schedules so to speak

285
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,839
now let's go back to

286
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,680
and this is particularly true of iowa

287
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,480
the midwest flight of the country

288
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,399
when locomotives first came out and were

289
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,640
going across the united states

290
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,320
those locomotives would spew fire

291
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,480
and it would set the wheat fields on

292
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,519
fire

293
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,480
and set the cornfields on fire

294
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,480
the farmers were pissed

295
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,000
but there wasn't a damn thing they could

296
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,440
do about it because the railroad

297
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,880
industry was protected protected by

298
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,160
congress

299
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,399
protected by business interests they did

300
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,399
not want to disrupt that

301
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,399
too bad farmer so you lost your crop bfd

302
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,720
we really don't care

303
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,720
now after a period of time enough people

304
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,200
got upset with that and took away the

305
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,959
protections

306
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,040
that the relative industry had about

307
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,800
stewie fire and sitting field cell fire

308
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,880
legislation is one way to accomplish it

309
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,800
but i don't hold out a lot of confidence

310
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,959
that that will occur

311
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,560
now the other thing i should share with

312
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,719
you

313
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,800
i'm a lawyer i'm a recovering attorney

314
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,480
i'm in favor of the lawyer full

315
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,360
employment act so what i'm going to talk

316
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,760
to you about now is litigation mass

317
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,120
litigation

318
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,240
against microsoft and oracle and others

319
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,320
and the small developers too they're

320
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,639
just as bad

321
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,959
it will take class actions to get them

322
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,959
to change their eye now you think that's

323
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,639
impossible

324
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,240
let's look at car safety

325
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,200
anybody remember mcpherson v buick

326
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,160
no

327
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,040
you've never heard of it until today

328
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,360
but that was a landmark case that said

329
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,000
you have privity of contract meaning you

330
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,880
can sue a manufacturer of an automobile

331
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,880
if it's effective

332
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,600
now if software is defective why can't

333
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,440
you sue them

334
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,120
part of the reason you can't sue them is

335
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,639
because they're a protected industry how

336
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,639
do we know they're a protected industry

337
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,600
how many of you read the shrink wrap

338
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,040
the shrink wrap license basically says

339
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,880
you are getting to use this product that

340
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,040
you're paying for

341
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,600
as is

342
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,800
if there are defects tough timber toes

343
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,639
it is your problem

344
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,399
not mine

345
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,560
and we're happy with that because we're

346
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,639
so accustomed to it and we feel

347
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,079
powerless to do something about it

348
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,600
i'm advocating let's get rid of that

349
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,760
protective legislation

350
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,079
let's do some litigation

351
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,800
let's change that system now

352
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
all of that is from my friend iowa which

353
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,279
is left or good

354
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,120
let's talk about the issues that we need

355
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,839
to deal with now

356
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,959
what is our objective the right of boom

357
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,399
that's to keep the hackers out of our

358
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,160
system how well are we doing it

359
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,920
this is for cat lovers

360
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,720
oh it's fascinating

361
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,480
but we just don't do enough

362
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,240
you know i mentioned earlier microsoft

363
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,920
issuing patches

364
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,800
well patch tuesday's a wonderful holiday

365
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,320
but it's followed by an even bigger

366
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,440
holiday

367
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,199
called

368
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,439
vulnerability wednesday hacker wins

369
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,079
all right this

370
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,680
is a depiction

371
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,000
of where all the nodes are that can

372
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,199
attack us

373
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,120
where there is light

374
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,959
there is a capability to come in and

375
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,199
attack us because the communications

376
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,440
network that we enjoy today is so much

377
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,839
more extensive than we had five years

378
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:38,800
ago

379
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,320
ten years ago

380
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,560
it's pervasive

381
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,279
hackers are always on the lookout to

382
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,760
take advantage of even your smallest

383
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,760
little imperfection

384
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,440
they have the time

385
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,720
the skill

386
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,000
and the drive

387
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,639
to know the inside of your system better

388
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,199
than you do

389
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,320
and i i don't mean to pick on csos

390
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,399
but all too often because of lack of

391
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,959
time because of lack of resources our

392
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,360
motto is tlar

393
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,360
that looks about right

394
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,959
nobody's going to notice that minor

395
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,519
imperfection and we'll just continue to

396
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,760
monitor the system

397
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,800
and hope

398
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,399
nothing happens

399
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,639
well the bad guys don't follow that

400
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:25,680
logic

401
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,360
and the bad ladies don't follow that

402
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,320
logic

403
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,800
they look for everything and try to

404
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,480
figure out your system

405
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,399
better than you can possibly get there

406
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,959
at all because they have the time

407
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,880
and they have the motivation

408
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,600
it doesn't it costs more to protect than

409
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,839
it does to attack

410
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,680
a basic rule

411
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,079
and they spend a lot of time and

412
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,320
intellectual energy and finding that

413
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,199
little hole that little password

414
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,040
that little connection

415
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,759
to take advantage

416
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,920
you know what we don't always understand

417
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,720
is

418
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,519
we have protected our system

419
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,600
but those that we are connected to how

420
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,800
they protected their system

421
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,320
and those that we've connected to

422
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,600
whether we don't know whether or not

423
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,440
they protected their systems who are

424
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,279
they connected to how they protected

425
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,440
their systems you see it's an endless

426
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,759
worry

427
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,120
uh most of you probably are

428
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,720
sophisticated in this audience and i

429
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,000
don't need to go through how an

430
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,320
exploited unfolds of stages

431
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,160
are you just looking at a copy of this

432
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,279
and i'm sure figure it out anybody got a

433
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,360
question on it we'll try to answer it

434
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,680
but i think this pretty much says it for

435
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,160
itself

436
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,120
exploits unfolding stages i love this

437
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,440
particular diagram

438
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,199
my son put this together by the way

439
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,279
i started taking him the black hat at

440
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,079
defcon many years ago when he was

441
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,759
in his early 20s

442
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,600
and he really enjoyed it

443
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,360
uh being there and i enjoyed having him

444
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,240
around

445
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,240
uh giving him something to do

446
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,559
a nice distraction and he got to meet a

447
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,160
lot of fascinating people because he

448
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,599
worked as a good

449
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,400
and uh escorted a lot around

450
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,240
so

451
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,839
this side

452
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,039
uh explains how it unfolds and stages

453
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,400
a visual demonstration

454
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,720
we don't ever want to see this that

455
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,400
means you've been had too bad

456
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,799
be alert for other techniques phishing

457
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,360
scams waterholes

458
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,440
the adversary is very good about

459
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,960
exploiting that

460
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,640
and they will come after your ceo

461
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,160
who no matter how smart they are in

462
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
terms of business is really devoid of

463
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,559
security practices and they'll say hey

464
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,320
joe ceo here is a great article that you

465
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,600
need to read

466
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,120
and they click on it

467
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,440
and when they click on it they download

468
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,160
bad code they download an attack

469
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,280
and you get blamed for it as a season

470
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,200
that's not really fair but that's just

471
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,559
the reality

472
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,760
so be very careful about

473
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,240
downloading anything from an email

474
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,840
address that you're not comfortable

475
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,360
my brother's a good

476
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,120
example of this

477
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,520
if i send him an email

478
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,799
that i don't i got five email addresses

479
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,640
if i don't use the same email address

480
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,120
with every email i sent to him he won't

481
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,120
open it that's how

482
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,880
paranoid he is

483
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,480
and i tried to explain to him i said

484
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,320
look i have these five email addresses

485
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,880
he said i'm only going to use one

486
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,559
if you want me to read it send it on

487
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,240
this particular address otherwise i'm

488
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,720
going to ignore it now that's a good

489
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,240
practice a little extreme perhaps

490
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,880
but nobody's hacked the system

491
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,750
so i guess that works

492
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,320
[Music]

493
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,240
most of the attacks that come after you

494
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,240
are tailored

495
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,799
it's not one size fits all anymore

496
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,120
they spend a lot of time designing an

497
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,320
attack

498
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,200
just for you

499
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,960
they're not interested in joe and bob

500
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,080
and phil

501
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,720
they're interested in only you

502
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,360
now that's a sign of adoration that i

503
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,840
don't particularly appreciate

504
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,039
but you need to keep that in mind

505
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,840
and as i've told many ceos have asked

506
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,919
why should i care and i tell them two

507
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,240
things number one

508
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,840
because they always respond this is a

509
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,280
technical issue

510
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,960
i don't need to know that that's belongs

511
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,480
to the propeller hips

512
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,720
and i said yes they implement

513
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,440
but this is a leadership issue

514
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,960
you're supposed to be the leaders of

515
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,120
your company you're supposed to make

516
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,679
sure that people who are responsible for

517
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,520
protecting you have the available

518
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,799
resources

519
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,799
and then i get a wise ass comment from a

520
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,360
ceo who says well gosh that's kind of

521
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,440
like being paid for burial insurance and

522
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,039
not dying

523
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,600
well i don't see the logic in that but i

524
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,360
see a lot of humor

525
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,480
in that but when you talk to the ceos

526
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,080
and talk to the leadership group around

527
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,440
the paper

528
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,120
make sure they understand this is a

529
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,640
leadership issue it's part of their

530
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,240
responsibility

531
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,039
it doesn't just fall on the cyber folks

532
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,760
in your on your team

533
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,760
and also help them realize that it's not

534
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,840
just you that are vulnerable but

535
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,720
everyone that you're connected to

536
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,240
not everyone

537
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,559
has protected their systems as well as

538
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,039
you have

539
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,159
no

540
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,840
vulnerability is too insignificant to

541
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,919
exploit anything and everything is fair

542
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,640
game to these folks and they spend a lot

543
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,960
of time a lot of energy

544
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,799
going after even the smallest little

545
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:43,760
glitch

546
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,120
in your system

547
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,520
so when you do

548
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,400
a penetration test

549
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,080
and you say well

550
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,600
most of the holes are corrected

551
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,840
but that's not good enough

552
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,600
spend the extra time

553
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,679
to make sure all of the vulnerabilities

554
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,080
are corrected not just the ones that are

555
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,320
more visible not just the ones that are

556
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,200
easier to correct

557
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,840
make their job harder

558
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,400
make your job safer

559
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,960
patching is critical

560
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,120
we tend to ignore that because it's too

561
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,520
hard sometimes

562
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,000
we tend to ignore training everyone

563
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,679
who's on the computer

564
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,200
about computer safety computer security

565
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,200
and it's particularly become a great

566
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,240
problem

567
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,840
post coping

568
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,760
why because so many of us are working

569
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,960
from home

570
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,559
so many of us are working on our

571
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,240
man-made disasters on portable devices

572
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,400
and what we've failed to realize is that

573
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,320
when you're working in your office

574
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,520
you're in a

575
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,760
protected enclave

576
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,440
because you've got a special team of

577
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,760
technologists that help protect that

578
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,280
environment

579
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,600
but when you're operating from home

580
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,360
how many of you think your home

581
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,919
environment is as safe as your office

582
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,120
environment

583
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,799
i'm glad nobody raised their hands

584
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,320
because in the home

585
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,240
everyone uses the same system

586
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,880
your kids

587
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,559
mine are grown so i don't have to worry

588
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,760
about that

589
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,440
but i do have to worry about my neighbor

590
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,760
who kills my white guy occasionally

591
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,679
because he has kids

592
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,039
not that there's anything wrong with

593
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,159
that

594
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,320
but we need to be extra special and

595
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,280
careful

596
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,000
about working from home and knowing who

597
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,640
we're connected to

598
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,919
at home

599
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,880
i'm sure you get more emails addressed

600
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,559
to your home system

601
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,720
than you did at the office addressed to

602
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,039
your office email system

603
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,960
and that just opens up a great window of

604
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,720
vulnerability for the hackers to come in

605
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,400
no matter how

606
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,919
strong

607
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,400
your defensive mechanisms are

608
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,320
there's always somebody

609
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,760
that has a way

610
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,559
of finding out

611
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,200
and get this to work

612
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,240
it'd be fascinating

613
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,360
i think this is so cool

614
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,640
that says it all that's a good one for

615
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,080
your cfo

616
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,039
all right

617
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,760
let's go through some other stuff

618
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,520
and have a little bit more time i don't

619
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,640
want to

620
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,400
interfere with this presentation

621
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,240
here we go yeah

622
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,039
let's back it up

623
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,120
okay

624
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,880
i like this because it shows wherever

625
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,480
there's light

626
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,320
there's connectivity

627
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,760
and one of the slides that i couldn't

628
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,840
find which i really love

629
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,440
shows how dark it is on the

630
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,440
trans-siberian railroad

631
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,440
there's no electrical connection down in

632
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,640
that area

633
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,720
and the same thing for north korea it is

634
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,480
completely dark

635
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,400
at night

636
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,760
because they don't have sufficient

637
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,159
electricity but yet

638
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,080
north korea

639
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,679
is a very dangerous hacking group

640
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,840
they work with china

641
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,200
they work with other nations allegedly

642
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,600
to hack into our systems and create

643
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,880
habit

644
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,279
don't underestimate the adversary

645
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,200
this is the last thing you want your

646
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,039
boss to see

647
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,799
the disappointment

648
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,080
don't

649
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,520
hide your

650
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,400
head

651
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,320
from the problem

652
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,240
address the problem it's much easier to

653
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,159
ignore it i agree

654
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,159
and hope and pray

655
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,880
but that's not a good strategy that does

656
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,520
not work

657
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,919
you need to be resilient you need to be

658
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,679
strong you need to know what you're

659
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,159
doing and how to do it and i'm hoping

660
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,760
that you have developed the confidence

661
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,400
to do that now part of it is having a

662
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,240
perception

663
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,600
how many of you look at this picture

664
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,640
and

665
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,320
imagine it is

666
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,879
the ocean

667
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,039
it's

668
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,520
nobody

669
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,200
yeah

670
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,640
that's the reaction i get from most

671
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,159
people i mean it's not a rhetorical

672
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,880
question they say my gosh

673
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,640
why would anybody want to drive in the

674
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,840
water

675
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,760
well the issue is this is not water this

676
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,919
is the desert

677
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,159
so be mindful of the perceptions that

678
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,799
you're dealing with on the internet

679
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,710
not everything looks like what it is

680
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,840
[Music]

681
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,120
your system

682
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,480
to you

683
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,360
is going to look complicated

684
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,960
and to the adversary it may look

685
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,559
complicated but they're going to get

686
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,559
involved and inside so much that they

687
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,200
know your system better than you do

688
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,960
and it's going to look like oh yeah

689
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,400
you're protected

690
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,880
but look at that big hole you left me to

691
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,919
come in and visit you

692
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,600
it's not as complicated as we like to

693
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,960
think it is

694
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,279
we can address that issue

695
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,720
we can't look out for the bad guys

696
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,080
notice in the middle there's a little

697
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,919
sailboat that doesn't seem to be

698
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,799
bothered at all by that big iceberg

699
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,400
that big threat

700
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,159
they're ignoring it

701
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,000
the last thing we need to do is to

702
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,240
ignore a known threat

703
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,080
or a developing threat

704
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,320
it's not all calm seas it's not all

705
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,600
beautiful

706
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,600
it's not a scenic route that we're on

707
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,320
trying to protect our sisters

708
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,640
here's what we have to be careful of

709
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,480
we have this little boat

710
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,080
in the middle of the ocean

711
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,480
and look at the threat underneath it and

712
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,679
they are completely oblivious

713
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,520
if i were in that boat i'd be paddling

714
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,160
like hell to get away from that

715
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,320
[Music]

716
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,400
we need to do the same thing and avoid

717
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,159
adversaries

718
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,000
it's not that complicated there is a

719
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,400
path we can follow it

720
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,720
tried and true

721
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,640
we don't need to be confused and think

722
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,120
it's too tough for us to do we can do it

723
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,039
and know who you're

724
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,120
i

725
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,120
i like this slide because it suggests

726
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,559
know who you're sleeping with but that's

727
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,960
not the topic of my point now

728
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,720
but know who you're hanging out with

729
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,960
know who you're connected with

730
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,799
even though they look different

731
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,799
even though they are different you need

732
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,039
to understand whether you can have can

733
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,880
afford to have a trusted relationship

734
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,919
with them

735
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,360
otherwise you're going to wind up

736
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,279
connected to everybody that you and you

737
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,360
have no idea who they are

738
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,600
or what their protective systems are and

739
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,080
that's going to make you vulnerable

740
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,320
you may think you've got a clear path to

741
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,520
success

742
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,039
and while you're basking in the

743
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,679
highlight and the sunlight of success

744
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,919
you fail to notice the impediments in

745
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,520
the middle of the road

746
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,679
the hackers that are coming out down at

747
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,279
the bottom

748
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,440
i hope all of you saw that

749
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,320
most people call me and say wow that's a

750
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,320
beautiful picture

751
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,320
you want to be happy

752
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,120
and know that you have succeeded in

753
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,600
protecting your system

754
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,760
find the proper way for people to

755
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,120
communicate

756
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,120
it's complicated but you're talented

757
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,640
enough to do that

758
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,039
and help them get through the thicket

759
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,440
of the danger that they're exposed to

760
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,960
on the internet

761
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,039
you're not alone doing this you may feel

762
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,039
that you're out on the precipice you're

763
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,520
all alone but you're not you have

764
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,799
support

765
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,399
and one of the points that richard made

766
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,320
that i'm going to make again too

767
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,360
join organizations that can help you

768
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,840
personally and

769
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,520
professionally and i'm part of one of my

770
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,440
part-time jobs as the general counsel of

771
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,960
issa

772
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,080
i am not here to tell you to join issa

773
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,960
isa did not sponsor this event so i'm

774
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,080
not prosecuting for issa

775
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,559
but there are organizations like them

776
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,120
that you should really consider joining

777
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,799
so that you're not all alone in trying

778
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,559
to solve this problem

779
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,279
you may think you're protected

780
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,480
but

781
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,000
there's always a vulnerability that

782
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,520
you've overlooked

783
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,000
here's part of the problem too

784
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,840
you have so many vendors that promise

785
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,919
you the solution

786
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,039
buy me and i'll set you free

787
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,919
buy my stuff and you're good enough

788
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,200
embracing the flying on that

789
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,559
constant

790
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,799
here's what you need to do

791
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,000
i really like your problem it is awesome

792
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,880
are you willing to stand behind oh yeah

793
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,799
yeah this is not covering this is a real

794
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,799
thing right

795
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,960
we'll buy your product but i want in

796
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,960
writing a guarantee

797
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,720
that if your product fails you're going

798
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,799
to pay the damage that resulted from

799
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,440
your defective product

800
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,120
now if you're selling a product are you

801
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,320
willing to sign that document

802
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,000
i doubt it

803
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,760
but if we put some pressure on the

804
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,120
vendors

805
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,799
maybe they will do a better job at

806
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,799
providing safer products

807
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,120
you go to rsa you go to black hat you go

808
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,000
to defcon you go to the vendors they all

809
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
say the same damn thing

810
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,559
it's like they had a text to remember

811
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,159
that particular week

812
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,159
they all sound alike

813
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,000
but none of them can really deliver what

814
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,440
we really need

815
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,880
the other thing you need to worry about

816
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,559
is your dashboard

817
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,880
don't have so many products that you

818
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,200
need to monitor to see what's going on

819
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,200
that you just get utterly confused and

820
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,880
don't know which one to pay attention to

821
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,559
always look for the secret way

822
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,200
some of them are tried and true

823
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,000
some of them are a little rocky

824
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,399
some are nice and clean i advocate

825
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,559
they're nice and clean

826
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,480
don't get stuck alone

827
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,519
help is there for you

828
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,600
you need to help your clients help your

829
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,799
team

830
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,480
get through the veins of cyber security

831
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,080
the lion and the tiger may be more

832
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,000
powerful

833
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
but the wolf does not perform in a

834
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,159
circus and i'm encouraging you to be a

835
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,159
wolf

836
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,000
we've seen that in your presentation

837
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,320
yesterday very dynamic

838
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,279
i like that approach

839
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,200
fear has two meanings forget everything

840
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,039
and run

841
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,360
all too often people do that

842
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,240
but i prefer face everything and rise

843
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,240
that's what we need to do individually

844
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,399
and collectively

845
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,000
whatever you do today do it with the

846
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,840
confidence of a four-year-old wearing a

847
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,320
batman shirt

848
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,919
have a hustle

849
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,240
get out there and kick ass and take

850
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,480
names

851
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,919
this is what you want to look like at

852
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,919
the end of the day

853
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,480
you may have been rude but you're still

854
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,080
standing

855
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,600
and with that i thank you

856
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,039

860
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,678
off the internet

861
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,679
look i'm so carried away i have three

862
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,760
detection systems on my home environment

863
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,559
and my son says dad that's wrong they

864
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,039
conflict with each other and i said yeah

865
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,120
they probably do

866
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,679
but i haven't been hacked

867
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,399

868
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:51,440

869
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,200

870
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,720
haven't been hacked

871
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,399
a lot of the people i

872
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,320
was able to find was through my

873
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,640
connections on facebook

874
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,039
while i'm in facebook hell

875
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,519

889
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,519
all your rights go away forever because

890
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:40,880
that's what they hide in certain way

891
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,799
around i mean every person that's not

892
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,960
involved technology you know

893
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,000

896
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,720
how do we ever get around that legally

897
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,640
in contractual law

898
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,240
just solve that problem please

899
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,919
well

900
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,399
let me borrow a page from my past

901
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,239
that might be beneficial

902
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,640
i'll close my eyes

903
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,800
but i'll ask for those of you who have a

904
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,879
relationship with your counsel to raise

905
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,359
your hand

906
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,079
one two

907
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,079
two and a half well you're different

908
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,399
you're special

909
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,000
as we'll find out when he gives this

910
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,399
presentation

911
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:27,199
one of the key people on your team and

912
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,119
make them part of your team is your

913
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,520
lawyer

914
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,599
help your lawyer understand what you're

915
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,280
trying to do

916
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,879
educate them

917
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:40,079
when i was in nsa as as

918
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,960
the senior lawyer for infosec

919
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,719
we had a group of people that were

920
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,399
testing

921
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:47,520
defense

922
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,159
systems and advocacy

923
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,800
basically they were hacking

924
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,199
and i was shocked i said god damn it you

925
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,839
do that that's a felony it's really very

926
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,119
disruptive

927
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,720
and they said well it's necessary that

928
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,599
we test these systems id and said yes

929
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,520
help me understand what you're doing so

930
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,839
i don't have to be a witness or go visit

931
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,839
you in jail

932
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,680
and so they took me into a group

933
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,359
and turned me into a hacker

934
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,920
now i wasn't all that good

935
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,320
but i understood what they were trying

936
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,880
to do and to an extent how they could do

937
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,520
it i got into their mindset

938
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,440
and that helped me a lot understanding

939
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,200
what they were trying to do

940
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,920
so then i took it on as an objective

941
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,000
how can i figure out a way for these

942
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,760
guys and gals to do this legally

943
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,520
and so i looked at

944
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,160
a governing directive for nsa that said

945
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,560
we're authorized to test communication

946
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,599
systems

947
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,359
well we'll be

948
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,280
that helps

949
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,240
but

950
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,280
what about

951
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,040
other communication systems that are

952
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,640
related to those

953
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,160
and so i looked at uh the usc 1048 i

954
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,280
think was the name number of it 1018

955
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,200
which is a criminal statute

956
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,720
if you violate it it's a felony if

957
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,439
you're convicted

958
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,359
but there's a provision in there that

959
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,599
says the owner of the system can prevent

960
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,119
you to come in

961
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,680
and test this system

962
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,440
well the conundrum is who is the owner

963
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,359
of the dod systems

964
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:22,960
i'm figuring what the hell let's go to

965
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,760
the top let's go to a second

966
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,520
so i had to brief the secretary of

967
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,760
defense general counsel who hated nsa

968
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,520
and i had to help her understand that we

969
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,839
were not nasty singing organization we

970
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,160
were there to protect communications

971
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,640
which was a lot of fun and fascinating

972
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,040
she said well rich that sounds very good

973
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,720
i think you need to go and talk to the

974
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,040
attorney general and grieve her

975
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,800
yes ma'am i said

976
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,880
i'll set up a meeting for us to go next

977
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,760
week

978
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,520
she said oh no

979
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,839
you go by yourself

980
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,920
now when a leader tells you to go by

981
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,160
yourself alert there's a message there

982
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,320
because in washington success has a

983
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,040
thousand fathers and failure is born

984
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,640
illegitimate

985
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,280
so here i was all by my own

986
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,119
going to meet the attorney general janet

987
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,480
reno

988
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,440
janet reno is about this tall or what

989
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,920
she's dead now unfortunately

990
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,720
she had a little bit of a

991
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,079
shake cerebral palsy or something

992
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,400
fascinating woman and i was

993
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,320
she was a brilliant lawyer i was

994
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,359
somewhat

995
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,440
intimidated and apprehensive about

996
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,560
meeting her

997
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,800
because in her college days she made

998
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,079
tuition

999
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,560
by wrestling alligators

1000
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,960
now if you have successfully wrestled

1001
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,760
alligators and still alive you must be

1002
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,599
pretty damn formal

1003
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,599
but she was absolutely amazing she said

1004
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,440
rich this is a wonderful idea let's do

1005
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,320
it

1006
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,599
and that led to uh eligible receiver 97

1007
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,359
which maybe one or two of you've heard

1008
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,320
of

1009
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,680
and that's where we took a group of

1010
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,839
people less than 20

1011
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,839
and took down the dod communication

1012
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,760
system in a test

1013
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,560
it was an amazing achievement

1014
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,880
and that sent a signal to the president

1015
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,680
of the united states

1016
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,480
who said we need to protect our critical

1017
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,400
infrastructure

1018
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,160
so it's important to have a good

1019
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,160
relationship with your lawyer

1020
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,079
to help them understand

1021
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,440
what you're doing

1022
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,079
and how best to do it legally

1023
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,079
make them your ally

1024
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,200
rather than your enemy thank you

1025
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,720

okay good question

1048
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,240
i should have realized that's something

1049
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,320
you would ask

1050
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,680
okay

1051
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,560
um ready for michael

1052
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,720
yes sir does that mean yes or you won't

1053
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,160
answer the question

1054
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,400
this may be off the subject but uh i

1055
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,440
wonder if people in china have

1056
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,000
the same problem we have here and i know

1057
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,960
china has their social credit system

1058
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,680
where they evaluate all their citizens

1059
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,480
so

1060
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,560
it's in theory easy to make a

1061
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,560
relationship you know whether the person

1062
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,200
is low or high on the citizenship do you

1063
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:17,920
see

1064
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,119
that in

1065
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,280
that type of approach

1066
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,240
expanding to different countries yes i'm

1067
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,119
a victim of here in the united states

1068
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,800
i'm convinced

1069
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,040
that

1070
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,960
i'm a victim of that

1071
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,560
social standing thing here in the united

1072
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,520
states

1073
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,319
i'm convinced that

1074
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,720
facebook saw something

1075
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,800
that they didn't like

1076
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,960
and decided to shut me down

1077
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,560
with no notice

1078
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,720
when i complained they said you can file

1079
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,079
a complaint

1080
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,200
we'll look at it and then we'll decide

1081
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,280
whether we say yes or no

1082
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,960
if we decide no

1083
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,839
your system is eliminated completely

1084
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,359
my system has been

1085
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,079
completely eliminated you know eight

1086
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:05,920
years of good stuff on facebook i

1087
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,760
thought i had a good relationship but

1088
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,440
they decided no

1089
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,000
i mean no due process

1090
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,920
nothing legitimate

1091
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,079
so yes we have a problem here in this

1092
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,839
country and i don't want to get into the

1093
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,640
politics of it on this stage i'll do it

1094
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,000
privately with you

1095
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,800
you may not like what i have to say

1096
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,599
but

1097
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,319
we are rapidly approaching

1098
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,000
some entities in the united states are

1099
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,480
rapidly approaching that type of system

1100
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,480
that the chinese have developed and

1101
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,079
remember too

1102
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:40,160
the chinese are using us technology to

1103
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,680
do this

1104
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,359
and they didn't buy it

1105
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,920
they stole it

1106
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,240
i love the chinese people i just don't

1107
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,439
like the chinese government

1108
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,119
all right

1109
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:59,880
all right michael come up and save me

1110
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,579
