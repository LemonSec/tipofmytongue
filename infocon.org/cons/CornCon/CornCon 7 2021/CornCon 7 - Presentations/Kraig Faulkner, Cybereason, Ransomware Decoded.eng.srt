our next speaker here is craig faulkner

13
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,920
he's a lead sales engineer for cyber

14
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,519
reason he's going to give us a great

15
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,480
talk on ransomware he coded so far a

16
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,960
free round of

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,840
all right can you hear me if i stand

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,520
this far away yeah good all right

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,399
okay cool yeah i mean we'll see

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,000
so today i want to talk about ransomware

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,800
so

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,079
a brief little uh bio here for you so as

23
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,520
sean mentioned i am a lead sales

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,000
engineer here at cyber reason uh my

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,239
day-to-day is interfacing with customers

26
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,039
like yourself uh to help defend against

27
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,000
the adversary so we focus on detection

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,079
response as well as

29
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,879
prevention and being able to understand

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,159
what's happening in environment and

31
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,560
correlated across the enterprise so what

32
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,479
we really focus on is the ability to see

33
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,400
a timeline of an attack

34
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,000
as it's occurring

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,880
both pre-breach and post breach so that

36
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,119
way we can understand how the thread

37
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,240
actor is occurring in your environment

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,400
instead of getting multiple alerts right

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,759
we try to correlate everything into a

40
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,439
single alert and give you actionable and

41
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,079
intelligible information um so that's my

42
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,680
quick little cyber reason pitch happy to

43
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,119
talk we've got a booth out there having

44
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,880
to talk more with you guys after the

45
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,520
fact but today i really want to focus on

46
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,040
um

47
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,920
on on ransomware and i think we all know

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,000
that ransomware is a huge problem it's

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,159
only gotten worse since probably 2015

50
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,040
2016. so just quote real quick rundown i

51
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,320
want to talk about the history of

52
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,479
ransomware is actually a really unique

53
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,280
story um with ransomware how it's

54
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,719
evolved and really when the first

55
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,719
ransomware occurred a lot of people

56
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,920
weren't aware of so i always like to

57
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,439
touch on it

58
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,360
talk about why ransomware why is it the

59
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,119
third actors use ransomware talk about

60
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,800
some techniques they use with double

61
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,800
extortion blackmail

62
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,480
talk about a few insights and trends

63
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,879
things we've seen recently from our

64
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,440
research teams as well as research teams

65
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,840
across the cyber security industry

66
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,920
talk about the golden age of ransomware

67
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,720
so i think we've seen definitely in 2020

68
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,120
and now even in the 2021 as we look at

69
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,959
even the last few months

70
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,640
that we are really in that golden asian

71
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,040
ransomware and what can we do about it

72
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,200
to help defend our enterprises and then

73
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,760
lastly as i just alluded to what actions

74
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,200
can you take to defend your environment

75
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,120
so let's start with history real quick

76
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,000
so

77
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,160
what's interesting about this slide is

78
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,959
that in 1989

79
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,120
was actually the first time that we

80
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,360
really recognized ransomware and so if

81
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,360
you don't know this story uh it's a

82
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,360
gentleman by the name of joseph klopp

83
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,680
and he was at the

84
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,879
world aids organization

85
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,480
and what they did they had a big

86
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,680
conference and he actually printed um it

87
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,319
was like 400 and something uh floppy

88
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,040
disks so imagine 1989 right so floppy

89
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,280
disk and what he did is he wrote

90
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,400
software

91
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,640
that when you put it into a drive a

92
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,159
floppy disk drive on a computer it

93
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,239
actually encrypted it and it had a

94
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,560
message that said that you had to pay

95
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,599
189 and had a location to an offshore

96
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,319
account um much like we see today

97
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,640
but he actually did it back in 1989 and

98
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,239
that was the first time that we really

99
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,599
saw that and then obviously as the

100
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,840
computer industry evolved in the 90s and

101
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,959
2000s ransomware you can see really

102
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,280
jumped up back to you know to 2013 so we

103
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,680
really didn't see much between then if

104
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,000
we did it wasn't you know a huge impact

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,879
to make the news but back in 1989 he is

106
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,720
now considered the father of ransomware

107
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,640
so um definitely encourage you to go

108
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,319
read more about it there's a lot of news

109
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,599
articles about

110
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,239
joseph klopp and the things that he did

111
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,040
but he he founded ransomware

112
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,360
so as we move on to the evolution again

113
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,319
we see in 2013 with crypto locker um

114
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,159
there's some other things in here with

115
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,239
petya uh wannacry do not remember petty

116
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,279
2017 raising hands yeah uh

117
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,120
difficult times i was actually on the

118
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,279
customer side at the point so i had not

119
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,280
come over to the sales side just yet i

120
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,479
was dealing with that in a large

121
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,800
healthcare organization so i definitely

122
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,479
know how that was in 2017 we saw 2017 uh

123
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,080
ryuk evolved

124
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,840
and then some others as well and then i

125
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,199
think if we look into uh now into 2020

126
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,360
as well down to 2021

127
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,960
there's some things that we've seen

128
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,120
where these third actors are devolving

129
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,639
and they're getting smarter if we look

130
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,400
at some things from just from the past

131
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,000
few months and this year um jbs cassaya

132
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,720
the half name attacks solar winds all of

133
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,800
these that are making big news now that

134
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,000
we're seeing that ransomware is a

135
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,479
problem it's not going away and we need

136
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,320
to do something about it i think that

137
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,520
you know probably our mindset back in

138
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,880
2016-2017 was that

139
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,160
okay if we

140
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,080
mitigate this now you know we'll be good

141
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,240
coming in the future unfortunately

142
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,080
ransomware has become such commodity in

143
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,919
the industry uh that we just don't see

144
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,560
it going away

145
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,919
so why is it that attackers even use

146
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,160
ransomware

147
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,520
well one there's kind of three um things

148
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,680
that we look at in regards to when they

149
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,120
run about work and pay and specifically

150
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,120
ransomware campaign one you want to look

151
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,840
at the impact how is it going to affect

152
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,919
who you're targeting uh who you're going

153
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,039
after we saw in the you know mid 20 you

154
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,880
know 2015 2016 with uh rants with uh

155
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,560
ryuk with wannacry all of those

156
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,919
it was more of that

157
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,000
we'll talk about more here a little bit

158
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,479
the spray and prey right so deploy this

159
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,120
malware deploy the ransomware to just

160
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,759
whoever we can and hope that somebody

161
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,680
pays the ransom and we've really evolved

162
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,680
to more of a targeted approach where the

163
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,240
threat actors are targeting specific

164
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,560
companies specific individuals so we

165
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,000
look at the impact we also look at the

166
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,360
complexity

167
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,319
as you guys know it's not it's not very

168
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,199
easy to develop a malware necessarily

169
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,120
but nowadays you can actually go buy

170
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,199
malware you can go buy a ransomware

171
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,800
campaign we'll talk more about that as

172
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,680
well so we look at the complexity of it

173
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,680
and then we also look at the popularity

174
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,680
what type of malware campaigns are being

175
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,919
used how are they being used and are

176
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,680
they effective and if they're effective

177
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,199
and popular then let's use it

178
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,120
after we look at these three things then

179
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,120
we can really start to look at who is

180
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,199
doing this so the first one is cyber

181
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,120
criminals i think this is very obvious

182
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,560
we all know that there's people out

183
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,280
there that are really trying to just

184
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,680
make a dollar right they are going to

185
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,599
deploy malware they want people to pay a

186
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,639
ransom and they want you to

187
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,000
be able to

188
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,240
encrypt your data so that way they can

189
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,599
make you pay and they can make money off

190
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,720
of you it's just a very criminal tactic

191
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,240
the second kind of group we see is

192
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,080
hacktivists as is everybody familiar

193
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,599
with the term hacktivist

194
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,680
yeah so really what they're what they're

195
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,960
doing is they have a cause and they

196
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,759
think by being able to deploy a malware

197
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,840
campaign deploy a ransomware campaign

198
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,759
that they can uh

199
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,560
create a cloud for their cause create

200
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,240
club for themselves

201
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,000
and be able to do it all for a cause

202
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,400
unfortunately i think we see kind of a

203
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,560
gray area between cyber criminals and

204
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,319
activists but i think some cyber

205
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,440
criminals think they're happiness right

206
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,280
but just to make a dollar i don't think

207
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,080
is a legitimate cause

208
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,360
and then the last one is nation state

209
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,440
hackers i think we all know who those

210
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,039
are we all know those countries where

211
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,319
they come from

212
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,240
this is that third group that we really

213
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,000
have to be focused on this is really

214
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,160
more centered around you know government

215
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,479
entities and the people that they're

216
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,800
trying to get information around

217
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,680
specifically target of the us

218
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,680
to be able to understand how we're doing

219
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,599
things get secrets

220
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,199
and be able to crack the code of the

221
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,879
things we're doing specifically with

222
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,720
military and our policies and things

223
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,080
like that so

224
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,359
we're seeing those three groups

225
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,000
so this next slide when i click here

226
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,599
you're going to see a bunch of articles

227
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,199
pop up and i have that done by attention

228
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,240
i'm not going to go through each and

229
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,080
every one of them but you'll see

230
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,479
that ransomware as i said earlier is not

231
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,039
going away this is just a very small

232
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,039
snapshot and you probably have read a

233
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,880
few of them as they popped up and are

234
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,559
very familiar with some of these i think

235
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,640
one the very first one that popped up it

236
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,719
talks about a patient that died

237
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,959
over in europe because of ransomware and

238
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,200
what happened is the patient was

239
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,880
actually in the ambulance being routed

240
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,959
to the hospital and in the time that

241
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:51,920
that

242
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,360
patient was being rounded to the

243
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,040
hospital that hospital was hit

244
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,640
ransomware and they had to reroute the

245
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,800
ambulance to a different hospital and in

246
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,040
the time that that happened the patient

247
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,080
actually

248
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,839
died

249
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,480
if that's not impactful enough

250
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,080
just with the healthcare industry but

251
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,399
much less with the the impact that

252
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,320
ransomware can have

253
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,480
i don't know what is uh it's very scary

254
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,880
to think that a hacker can get into an

255
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,000
environment uh can be able to deploy

256
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,399
this ransomware deploy the malware and

257
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,240
really affect patient care if we talk

258
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,920
specifically about healthcare we start

259
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,560
talking about other industries

260
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,120
manufacturing supply chain

261
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,519
all of these things that really make our

262
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,120
economy flourish

263
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,040
if they go down

264
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,880
we have a big problem let's talk about

265
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,480
the colombian pipeline for a second we

266
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,920
saw on the east coast and i think it

267
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,760
started spreading a little bit further

268
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,839
west as we

269
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,360
were dealing with the colonial pipeline

270
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,360
attack

271
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,200
gas was

272
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,959
hard hit right we had people that were

273
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,360
filling up plastic bags

274
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,200
right and if you guys remember seeing

275
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,399
that on the news they were literally

276
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,920
putting gas in plastic bags they thought

277
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,360
they were going to be able to get gas

278
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,200
because it really impacted that pipeline

279
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,560
it's one of the largest pipelines we

280
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,880
have and it impacted that pipeline so

281
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,959
much just by somebody deploying

282
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,360
ransomware

283
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,519
a couple other ones here we talked about

284
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,160
um this last one was popped up back in

285
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,240
march where the homeland security issues

286
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,320
statement regarding ransomware i think

287
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,760
we're going to start really getting if i

288
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,519
kind of talk about thought leadership as

289
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,040
we evolve with this history of

290
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,959
ransomware and where we're at today

291
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,240
where we're going

292
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,760
i really believe that we're going to

293
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,959
start seeing that government getting

294
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,800
much more involved with policy in

295
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,640
regards to how these things are handled

296
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,240
within our companies

297
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,959
it's it's not a secret that you know

298
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,480
politics has its place in our country

299
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,320
but unfortunately i think that there's

300
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,240
going to have to be some controls that

301
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,399
are applied by the government as we go

302
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,240
forward whether we like it or not just

303
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,279
because we've got to make sure that we

304
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,240
mitigate these risks

305
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,279
all right so

306
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,760
why is it that we need to prioritize

307
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,399
ransomware defense well

308
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,519
one

309
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,680
ransomware payment right none of us want

310
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,360
to make the payment

311
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,000
unfortunately though i think some people

312
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
feel that it's better to just make the

313
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,519
payment and be able to move on and get

314
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,279
their data back

315
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,000
the the downside to that is you don't

316
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
know that you're gonna one get your data

317
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,800
back

318
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
and two even if you get it back you

319
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,079
don't know that you're actually

320
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,600
recovering

321
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,240
so i don't know that we really want to

322
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,600
pay the ransom we definitely don't want

323
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,440
to pay the ransom so we need to focus on

324
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,680
the defense tactics to make sure that we

325
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,839
aren't getting ransomware what types of

326
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,560
things can we do and it's so basic as to

327
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,160
patching your systems

328
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,320
upgrading legacy systems right it's some

329
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,480
of the basics that we all know is it

330
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,240
practitioners much less cyber security

331
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,320
practitioners to make sure that we don't

332
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,360
have to make these payments

333
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
another one is business continuity right

334
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,279
we want to make sure that we have the

335
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,320
ability to function our business if we

336
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,000
are getting attacked it's going to not

337
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,079
only cost money rather be from payment

338
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,760
or from operational costs to be able to

339
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,279
recover

340
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,200
but really you're down right if you're

341
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,440
uh let's talk about maybe a financial

342
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,079
firm right that gets attacked

343
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,399
their downtime is dollars

344
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,399
really any company their downtime is

345
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,320
dollars and if you start correlating

346
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,600
that together

347
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,279
you're really gonna

348
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,959
make the case for yourself to your board

349
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,040
your executives to say okay let's just

350
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,440
defend against it and then we won't

351
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,360
hopefully have the problem right i think

352
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,880
we've kind of coined the phrases cyber

353
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,120
security it's not a matter if but when

354
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,120
um at this point i feel if we haven't

355
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,120
been attacked we're just lucky

356
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,800
and it's unfortunate and it's kind of

357
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,560
grim to say that but it's really the

358
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,320
truth

359
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,200
so

360
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,560
a couple other things we talked about i

361
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,839
mentioned

362
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,040
it costs in general ir costs as well one

363
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,720
thing that we do here at cybereason is

364
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,720
we have an ir retainer that you can

365
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,240
purchase and we can put boots on the

366
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,440
ground in the event that you have an

367
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,200
incident there's many companies that do

368
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,680
that but they cost you money being able

369
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,000
to have not only your own ir team that's

370
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
running doing investigations trying to

371
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,680
be proactive but if you need that

372
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,279
advanced level support from a vendor

373
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,279
like cyber reason it does cost money

374
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,959
insurance coverage is another one too i

375
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,959
think we're seeing cyber insurance is a

376
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,360
pretty hot commodity these days that

377
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,040
also costs money

378
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,040
but then we can start talking about what

379
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,120
are things that are non-monetary your

380
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,720
reputation

381
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,959
your intellectual property those aren't

382
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,720
those don't necessarily have a direct

383
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,959
correlated dollar value

384
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,160
but they can

385
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,480
be a huge hindrance to your business and

386
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,279
so you want to make sure you're

387
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,959
defending against that as well because

388
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,639
that intellectual property that

389
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,320
reputation is really what matters for

390
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,399
you as a company

391
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,720
regulatory fines is another one with the

392
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,160
advent of gdpr ccpa i think new york is

393
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,399
in process of issuing one as well when

394
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,920
you have these regulations that are

395
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,800
coming up around data around access to

396
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,639
that data and what you like as a company

397
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,760
have to do

398
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,199
you want to make sure that that data is

399
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,360
defended because again your customer

400
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,120
data your intellectual property that's

401
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,160
what's important and you want to make

402
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,079
sure you defend against it and then last

403
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,279
but not least we already talked about

404
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,880
loss of human life we specifically

405
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,199
talked about the healthcare industry

406
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,560
as you know if there's is there any

407
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,880
healthcare workers in the room right now

408
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,199
by chance no healthcare

409
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,199
you guys probably all know i spent a

410
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,959
long time in the healthcare industry

411
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,120
from cyber security perspective and one

412
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,480
thing that we saw a lot and i think it's

413
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,639
that way probably manufacturing as well

414
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,639
and probably some other industries but

415
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,920
we saw legacy systems and legacy systems

416
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,399
is an absolute downfall to cyber

417
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,800
security so if you have legacy systems

418
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,480
my little piece of advice let's get them

419
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,440
upgraded

420
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,760
getting them upgraded will help mitigate

421
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,480
some of that risk

422
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,360
all right so let's talk a little bit

423
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,519
about insights and trends what are we

424
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,040
seeing with ransomware how is it

425
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,800
evolving and

426
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,360
and what are we doing about it

427
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,279
so this is ransomware i'm going to take

428
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,440
this out is that okay with everybody

429
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,680
i don't feel like standing still

430
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,000
there we go yeah

431
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,839
i want to move around a little bit

432
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,399
so if we talk about um single stage

433
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,880
ransomware what happens

434
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,800
they get into your system

435
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,560
right whether that be through a phishing

436
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,519
attack

437
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,320
uh

438
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,160
drive by download some sort of

439
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,880
vulnerability in let's say office or

440
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,880
adobe or some other they get into your

441
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,480
environment and then they find a way to

442
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,959
be persistent

443
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,880
is there anybody can tell me what it

444
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,800
means for an attacker to be persistent

445
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,800
in their environment

446
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,920
i would say i have a gift card to give

447
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,279
you if you give me the answer but i

448
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,639
don't have one so

449
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,600
anybody persistence

450
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,399
yes

451
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,079
perfect perfect example some have

452
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,160
agreements so the ability to stay in

453
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,160
your environment no matter what you do

454
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,959
right

455
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,320
so

456
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,480
reboots for example okay well you know

457
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,320
what let's just try to reboot everything

458
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,800
with 350 servers and hope well they've

459
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,440
found a way for dll or some other

460
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,720
they've gotten into a service account

461
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,079
they've done something to where then

462
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,480
they can still survive no matter what

463
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,440
mitigation you try to take

464
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,360
then at some point

465
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,600
they detonate right whether that be

466
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,519
immediately or we're seeing a lot of

467
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,759
custom packers nowadays too where

468
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,519
they're deploying it you wouldn't even

469
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,680
recognize it as malware

470
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,519
until 10 minutes or 10 hours

471
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,040
or three days

472
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,759
or 60 days i think the average well-time

473
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:28,639
uh

474
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,959
latest report is around 60 days of an

475
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,079
attacker that should be sitting in your

476
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,440
environment you have no idea they're

477
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,680
there stale accounts

478
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,279
right make sure we're cleaning up stale

479
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,880
accounts

480
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,440
so when they detonate then they crypt

481
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,959
once they encrypt

482
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:43,839
then

483
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,199
they attempt to get you to pay that

484
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,199
ransom right so that's a single stage

485
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,720
ransomware that's what we saw early on

486
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,959
it could still happen but really what's

487
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,800
happening is these attackers are getting

488
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,399
much more advanced

489
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,000
so as you can see here there's a couple

490
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,639
of yellow blurbs here that show you that

491
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,759
they're doing a lot more now

492
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,199
so not only are they getting your

493
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,119
environment they're staying persistent

494
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,559
but then once they're persistent they're

495
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,559
moving laterally

496
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,839
they're getting you to connect up to a

497
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,799
command and control server

498
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,720
they're accessing

499
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,720
privileged accounts

500
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,359
getting access beyond their initial

501
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,760
infiltration

502
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,919
stealing those credentials

503
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,439
keeping them continuing to stay

504
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,160
persistent then they're detonating

505
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,200
right

506
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,200
encrypting

507
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,679
going across multiple machines making it

508
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,520
operate much like a worm

509
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,880
to where they're not just doing one

510
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,120
machine and one user or a group they're

511
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,080
trying to go across the entire

512
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,559
enterprise and crawl them

513
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,200
then again hope that you pay that ransom

514
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,640
but then we're seeing this new mantra

515
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,440
from

516
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,960
the adversaries

517
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,480
and then it's not only are they trying

518
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,799
to get you to pay the ransom and make

519
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,400
money that way

520
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,600
they're also selling your data

521
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,760
so now they're double extorting you

522
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,600
so now

523
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,000
you're kind of out of luck from two

524
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,160
perspectives okay so now you pay the

525
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,320
ransom you've got your data back let's

526
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,799
say you're unable to unencrypt it all

527
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,720
and you get it all and you recover

528
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,240
but now it's out there

529
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,720
it's been sold to the highest bidder

530
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,280
so now again you're in a place where

531
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,880
you're just kind of stuck and you don't

532
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,600
know

533
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,160
what to do so go back to that how do we

534
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,840
defend we need to defend these

535
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,200
environments we need to make sure that

536
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,840
we deploy tools and have people that are

537
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,080
trained and well knowledgeable to defend

538
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,639
your environment

539
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,440
so i talked about this briefly earlier i

540
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,840
think i mentioned um

541
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,679
spray and prey briefly

542
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,200
but earlier like pre-2016 really what we

543
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,200
saw was the ability for

544
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,919
a threat actor to

545
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,679
target a company targeted an individual

546
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,679
whoever they can get their hands on and

547
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,679
try to get them to pay ransom right

548
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,440
spray and pray just

549
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
put it out there and hope that somebody

550
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
pays a ransom

551
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,039
a lot of that spray and pray technique

552
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,880
though was centered more around the

553
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,240
individual not to say they weren't

554
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,600
targeting companies but a lot of times

555
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,440
they were targeting individuals

556
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,440
the problem with targeting individuals

557
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,880
like us as our you know at our home

558
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,960
one a lot of times you don't know that

559
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,799
those individuals have the ability to

560
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,880
pay right so you have joe user at home

561
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,480
do they even have the funds to be able

562
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,000
to pay the ransom

563
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,840
and is it really important data enough

564
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,600
for them to want to pay the ransom or

565
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,200
can they just start over fresh right

566
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,480
but when they were attacking

567
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,919
organizations it was kind of the same

568
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,520
way they weren't really

569
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,360
trying to aim at anybody in particular

570
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,640
they were really just doing that

571
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,799
spraying prey technique and hoping

572
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,880
that they got a company that's big

573
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,760
enough that's willing to pay the ransom

574
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,720
well as we've evolved uh as the threat

575
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
actors evolved

576
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,480
they've actually started doing targeted

577
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,440
campaigns right now they are going after

578
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,480
company a and company b and company c

579
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,640
because they know they have the money

580
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,640
they know they have important data that

581
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,640
now they can blackmail and sell the

582
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,159
highest bidder

583
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,159
and double extort them and get double

584
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,320
funds right

585
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,159
between 2019 and 2020 little point here

586
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,760
the average range of payment tripled

587
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,679
we'll repeat that again the average

588
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,559
ransom payment in one year between 2019

589
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,960
and 2020 tripled i don't know what it is

590
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,720
in 2021 yet we're not there yet i would

591
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,799
venture to assume so you can see that

592
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,919
blue line it's probably gone up again

593
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,720
so again it just really goes back to

594
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,720
make sure that we do the basics make

595
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,440
sure we defend our environments we don't

596
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,919
want ransomware to get in because then

597
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,080
we have to deal with it if we can avoid

598
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,679
dealing with it we're going to be much

599
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,240
better off

600
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,440
the other point here is just that the

601
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,120
attacks have definitely increased since

602
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,720
2016 back with uh wannacry not petya and

603
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,320
things we just continue to see the

604
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,120
evolved evolution of ransomware being a

605
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,720
problem if you remember back to that

606
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,000
timeline that i showed you at the very

607
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,120
beginning

608
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,679
you can see between 2016 and now how

609
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,120
many bullets were on the timeline and

610
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,799
that's just a few right that's just a

611
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,120
little snippet of some of the big ones

612
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,440
so it's getting worse it's a problem

613
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,159
that's not going away

614
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,919
so let's talk about the targets

615
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,480
what makes a good target

616
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
for a ransomware attack anybody got an

617
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,480
idea

618
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,400
critical infrastructure potential money

619
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,200
so companies that have loads of it let's

620
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,559
encrypt their data and see if they'll

621
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,840
pay it right anybody else

622
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,000
i like this to be interactive sorry to

623
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,559
put you on the spot

624
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,200
those who require 99 uptime critical

625
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,080
infrastructure bingo right if you need

626
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,200
99 uptime which i think probably just

627
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,960
about every business these days needs

628
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,400
that that's a great attack vector right

629
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
if you can make them have downtime what

630
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,880
are they going to want to do pay you off

631
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,200
right

632
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,400
second one small it teams i see this far

633
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,400
too often

634
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,480
not only is it small i t teams but it's

635
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,840
really small cyber security teams

636
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,000
i think on average

637
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,760
[Music]

638
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,159
if i on a good day i talk to a customer

639
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,960
and they've got 10 cyber people

640
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,400
i mean i've talked to some customers

641
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,240
they've got 50 they've got 100 right i'm

642
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,919
like yeah you guys are mature and then i

643
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,000
start talking to them and realize okay

644
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,840
we've got some work to do but that's

645
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,880
okay that's what i'm here for right

646
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,880
but small it teams small cyber security

647
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,960
teams is a detriment

648
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,320
unfortunately

649
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,159
we are in a deficit in our industry

650
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,679
there's not enough of us to go around

651
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,679
right i think we all know that

652
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,840
but just running really lean you're not

653
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,039
going to really be able to apply the

654
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,679
defense you need to apply so

655
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,280
threat actors know that they're going to

656
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,880
attack that

657
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,159
if you don't have enough people to do

658
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,840
proactive threat hunting

659
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,080
24 7 365

660
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,400
call cyber reason we can do it for you

661
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,080
that was my plug that was my sales pitch

662
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,159
for the day you like that

663
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,600
all right

664
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,520
uh and i never claimed to be funny by

665
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,039
the way so please don't feel like you

666
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,120
have to laugh at my jokes um those who

667
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,559
use legacy systems we already talked

668
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,640
about this xp

669
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,679
server 2003 server 2008

670
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,520
let's get upgraded guys let's get it to

671
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,000
where we have infrastructure that is up

672
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,440
to date and makes sense to use in 2021

673
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,840
right

674
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,360
so that's what makes a good target

675
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,360
well once they've identified their

676
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,200
target

677
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,240
then they got to know how they're going

678
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,559
to go and do it

679
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,200
well how do they do it

680
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,880
ironically what they're doing today is

681
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,679
they're going buying how to do it

682
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,520
most of these threat actors we're seeing

683
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,760
are not the guys you expect

684
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,600
sitting behind a keyboard

685
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,679
in their hoodie in the corner in the

686
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:18,400
dark

687
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,159
writing code and deploying it to your

688
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,760
enterprise

689
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,679
most of what we're seeing is those

690
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:24,640
people

691
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,159
aren't actually deploying it they're

692
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,919
selling it

693
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,440
once they sell it

694
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,120
somebody can go

695
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,120
and run a ransomware campaign

696
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,720
it's called razz

697
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,279
ransomware as a service

698
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,120
the unfortunate side of this is they're

699
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,919
giving them everything they need

700
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,840
they're giving them the tactics the

701
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,279
techniques they're giving them technical

702
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,000
support they're giving them the tools

703
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,720
they're giving them everything

704
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,240
for just a small amount of money if you

705
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,000
look at these screenshots i have up here

706
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
389

707
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,880
i mean that's not much

708
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,320
but then the next screenshot's even

709
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,880
worse it's only 65

710
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,960
now there's probably a big variation i

711
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,799
don't know these particular two off the

712
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,720
top of my head but it's funny it says

713
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,760
get philadelphia at a special

714
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,200
but it's just a few hundred dollars

715
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,360
right and they're able to buy ransomware

716
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,600
buy a whole campaign

717
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,520
and get into your environment

718
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,120
again it's not that person sitting in

719
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,400
the corner that person sitting in the

720
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,000
corner they're the ones that are selling

721
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,360
it they're making their money by giving

722
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,880
you the service

723
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,159
or giving them a threat after the

724
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,559
service

725
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,720
so then as we talked about earlier too

726
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,760
we're seeing this paradigm shift

727
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,640
where it's not deploy ransomware and get

728
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,960
somebody to pay the ransom necessarily

729
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,320
that's good

730
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,720
maybe they will maybe they won't right

731
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,320
maybe we say it's a million dollars for

732
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,400
you to have to pay the ransom and

733
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,919
you negotiate with them and they pay you

734
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,360
300 000. fine whatever 30 000. cool but

735
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,679
really what's happening is on the back

736
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,360
side they're going and selling that data

737
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,080
and that's really nowadays what's worked

738
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,120
money

739
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,640
think about pii i've talked about

740
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,120
healthcare several times think about pii

741
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,400
patient paid in healthcare environment

742
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,559
and what that costs

743
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,679
and to be able to access to that data

744
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,200
you really can hold someone ransom

745
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,600
if you think about intellectual property

746
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,679
source code

747
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,679
that's worth way more

748
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,520
on the dark web

749
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,559
than

750
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:29,840
potentially what you're going to get the

751
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,679
company to pay at ransom if they even

752
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:32,559
pay

753
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,400
maybe they have cyber insurance

754
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,200
that's another form of attack too where

755
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,480
they're focusing on companies that they

756
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,679
know have cyber insurance because they

757
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,440
know they're gonna get paid

758
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,480
maybe they're not gonna get paid

759
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,960
everything they're demanding but that

760
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,159
insurance coverage they're gonna get

761
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,559
some sort of payment

762
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,720
i think i touched on all those points i

763
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,320
don't want to sit here and focus on

764
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,760
every one of them

765
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,200
legal ramifications too i think there's

766
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,360
a big one um

767
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,360
and we talked about earlier

768
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,600
that

769
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,159
unfortunately i think at least for now

770
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,080
we're going to start seeing i think

771
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,240
again in my prediction and research i've

772
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,000
done some government interference in

773
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,399
this whether we like it or not

774
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:19,520
because i think there's going to need to

775
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,240
be some policy regulation around cyber

776
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,640
around ransomware in particular we're

777
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,960
already seeing some of that right evolve

778
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,559
uh seeing some of that go to the senate

779
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,320
floor and things like that where those

780
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,520
types of bills and stuff are getting

781
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,840
passed we're looking to get past yeah

782
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,159
uh

783
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,159
and you're exactly right so what he was

784
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,159
saying is that aig was

785
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,760
declining cyber insurance because they

786
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,200
needed certain controls in place and

787
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,880
you're exactly right and that's a great

788
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,960
point

789
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,559
in that respect then i think that we're

790
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,320
probably in a two-fold approach

791
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,320
government runs slow right so i think

792
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,919
that that's no secret so that's probably

793
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,760
some of it but yeah that's a great point

794
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,080
that cyber insurance much like life

795
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,600
insurance i think life insurance is much

796
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,760
the same way you have to meet certain

797
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,360
thresholds you can't be a smoker you

798
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,720
can't you know you have to be under a

799
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,320
certain age you know all that or your

800
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,480
premium goes up so yeah great point

801
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,720
thank you

802
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,720
will not renew you at all wow

803
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,919
i want to talk more about that come see

804
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,399
the side reason booth

805
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,279
so again talk about government right so

806
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,360
paying the ransom

807
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,760
we're gonna start seeing some uh

808
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,200
potential

809
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,200
government type things come out this one

810
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,640
in particular screenshots around

811
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,559
that

812
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,720
ransom payments could potentially at

813
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,360
some point

814
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,960
violate anti-money laundering laws

815
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,320
and some other laws that are already in

816
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,000
place they're kind of finding i feel

817
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,080
like a little bit of a loophole

818
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,520
to be able to

819
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,279
tell people that they're violating some

820
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,679
sort of policy that already exists

821
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,000
because they're paying the ransom so i

822
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,279
think we're going to continue to see

823
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:41,559
more things evolve there

824
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,240
so before

825
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,000
this slide

826
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,080
me and several others in my company have

827
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,440
presented this

828
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,679
similar deck we all have our own way

829
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,039
that we present but um it was 2020 the

830
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,039
year of ransomware i put a question mark

831
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,799
behind it because i don't know that we

832
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,640
know 2020 is the year ransomware anymore

833
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,799
because 2021 shaped it up to be a

834
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,720
competitor

835
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,600
so

836
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,720
but let's look at that um

837
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,320
ransomware is the most aggressive that

838
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,559
it's been in 2020 we've seen and now

839
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,799
into 2021 we've seen where it's really

840
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,039
prominent it's very aggressive and we're

841
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,840
seeing these attack campaigns happening

842
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,320
and flourishing and companies are having

843
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,399
to do something about it whether

844
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,080
paying ransom

845
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,760
cash under cyber insurance getting boots

846
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,120
on the ground with an hour retainer

847
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,799
doing investigations things like that

848
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,918
all of which are very costly

849
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,120
as i mentioned earlier we're seeing a

850
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,960
paradigm shift

851
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,520
we're seeing ransomware not just be an

852
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,640
infection

853
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,559
pay the ransom we unencrypt or we give

854
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:43,919
you the key right

855
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,399
we're now seeing okay you do all that

856
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:47,840
but while you're doing that we're also

857
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,279
going to sell all your data the highest

858
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,200
bidder and make that money as well so

859
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,640
we're seeing this huge paradigm shift

860
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,240
one thing that's very interesting to me

861
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,440
and i'm actually in the process of doing

862
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,080
some research around this

863
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,919
for kind of an internal project that i'm

864
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,440
doing and it's

865
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,159
joint ventures between threat groups

866
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,000
we're seeing where threat actors are

867
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,559
actually working together now

868
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,399
and that's pretty scary if you think

869
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:13,760
about it because

870
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,120
you have somebody that specializes in

871
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,720
one thing and another person specializes

872
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,840
in another thing and they're joining

873
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,240
forces

874
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,000
the only thing that comes out of that is

875
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,559
more evil right and so we're seeing

876
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,720
where they are collaborating they're

877
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,320
taking

878
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,240
what they've done in the past they're

879
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,159
evolving it they're getting techniques

880
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,720
from their friends and evolving it

881
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,240
and making it to where it really is a

882
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,760
joint operation between these third

883
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,080
actors

884
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,919
and the last one here you know we're

885
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,559
we're just seeing the very common

886
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,960
vectors that they're attacking

887
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,080
fishing

888
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,320
right

889
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,480
i'm gonna dare to ask this question to

890
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,559
see if anybody raises their hand who has

891
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,080
fallen for a fishing campaign in this

892
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,080
room

893
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,600
yeah i'll admit it i have i did earlier

894
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,039
this year

895
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,120
i had suckers oops

896
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,519
uh it was legit i mean it looked so good

897
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,200
a couple days later got an email from

898
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,399
our chief security officer hey guys

899
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,240
this is a test

900
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,960
oh man i failed the test

901
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,279
um so i've been on the you know naughty

902
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,480
list is what it is nothing happened but

903
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,799
i mean it looked legitimate i

904
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,480
i can't recall exactly the email was but

905
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,799
i fell for it that's probably once

906
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,320
maybe two or three times that i've

907
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,760
actually done it but

908
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,240
the average user falls for phishing

909
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,840
emails

910
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,440
a lot

911
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,159
um sms phishing is kind of that new

912
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,760
evolution people are getting these text

913
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,080
messages i got blown up last week with

914
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,679
these crazy text messages and i'm like

915
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,279
what are these how are these people

916
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,279
getting my number you know so i'm asking

917
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,279
all these crazy questions because i'm

918
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,720
getting these random text messages hey

919
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,559
click this thing

920
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,320
earlier this week quick little anecdote

921
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,760
for you a buddy of mine sent me a bunch

922
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,200
of youtube links

923
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,279
and it was weird because i have an

924
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,039
iphone and on the

925
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,799
on the preview it didn't a lot of times

926
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,559
it'll show like the

927
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,240
first little snippet of the video just

928
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,880
like a still of that video it just said

929
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,799
tap to download preview

930
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:17,919
and i'm like

931
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,840
why are you sending me this so texas was

932
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,880
like what is it he's like dude they're

933
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,159
all legitimate and i'm like i'm still

934
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,000
like clicking on them like i trust you

935
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,360
but it's not like clicking on them right

936
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,760
like i just i'm too paranoid it's funny

937
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,200
i've actually made my wife paranoid

938
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,799
because she now doesn't click on things

939
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,000
too she asked me which is very good

940
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,279
um

941
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,519
and then as we talked about earlier

942
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,240
vulnerable assets right legacy operating

943
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,360
systems

944
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,440
stale accounts please clean up active

945
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,760
directory guys

946
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,760
somebody leaves the company delete their

947
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,000
account get it out of there don't let

948
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,559
the threat actor have a vector to get in

949
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,720
that's easy

950
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,320
harder harder set than that what was

951
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,519
that

952
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,360
word flows automation

953
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,240
yes

954
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,200
automation that's awesome

955
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,519
so as i'm kind of coming up on time here

956
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:08,800
i want to make sure i get through all

957
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,320
this stuff here

958
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,199
so what was impacted right manufacturing

959
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,040
health care what else is up there

960
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,199
education all the common industries that

961
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,239
we know of and then just quick blur

962
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,760
what's interesting here is you don't see

963
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,280
these well you don't see latin america

964
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,520
really lit up or africa which

965
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,960
i have my own theories around that but

966
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,719
notice you don't see eastern europe lit

967
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,560
up

968
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,480
a little nudge nudge wink wake but you

969
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,560
see western europe you see america you

970
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,279
see australia

971
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,639
so one thing i want to touch on here

972
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,760
real quick is so this is actually um

973
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,520
information about what we did when it

974
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,520
came to the egrego ransomware

975
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,119
um so we saw

976
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,839
that this was supposedly tied to the

977
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,599
maze cartel if anybody's familiar with

978
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,960
that

979
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,760
uh best we know and it was they are very

980
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,560
well known for double extortion right so

981
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,760
being able to uh get somebody to click

982
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,880
on a link their drive by download and

983
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,359
then be able to encrypt but also once

984
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,359
they get that data to sell it

985
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,359
a lot of times it comes through a

986
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,160
phishing email it solves quarkbot and

987
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,440
then actually launches the malware

988
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,960
uh one thing that we do at some reason

989
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,520
really well is threat research so we

990
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,760
have a whole team called nocturnas

991
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,760
and nocturnas

992
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,760
every day in and out that's what they do

993
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,079
they research intelligence understanding

994
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,440
what's happening in the environment and

995
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,040
so that's how we're able to get a lot of

996
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,520
this information even months before we

997
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,800
see an attack right so

998
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,800
making sure that we know who's out there

999
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,720
doing what so we can apply those rules

1000
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,078
and our logic of our tool

1001
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,440
so real quick here

1002
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,560
map where

1003
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,480
as an attack how does it happen right so

1004
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,400
if we look on the left hand side here

1005
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,839
you can see that there was an excel

1006
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,280
process

1007
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,000
that uh injected on a the run dll-32

1008
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,240
which then launched explorer

1009
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,720
uh which was the malicious process for

1010
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,520
uh

1011
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,280
the tool called cobalt string

1012
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,960
so what they did here is they infected

1013
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,920
it

1014
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,920
and then they were able to leverage a

1015
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,839
different tool

1016
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:22,480
to be able to take action and they can

1017
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,320
do a myriad of things here right they

1018
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,400
can get to connect out to a commanding

1019
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,640
control server or they can

1020
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,480
do lateral movement right

1021
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,079
and what they do a lot of times once

1022
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,000
they get in in that capability and

1023
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,599
launch something like cobalt strike or

1024
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,800
metaploid

1025
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,200
then they use what we call living off

1026
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,400
the land techniques

1027
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,720
right then they're using wmi they're

1028
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,160
using powershell

1029
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,000
using visual basic scripts whatever it

1030
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,760
is they can get their hands on to run

1031
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,040
those commands and those are things that

1032
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,800
are in your environment on a daily basis

1033
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,720
that you have to have

1034
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,160
so then you got to start talking about

1035
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,760
well how do you harden these machines

1036
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,760
how do you give users access to only the

1037
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,040
things they need and it probably goes

1038
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,480
back to the automation piece right

1039
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,079
you're onboarding somebody are they

1040
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,160
assist admin or are they in finance

1041
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,359
right so those are two completely

1042
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:08,598
different goals

1043
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,280
this is a much bigger expanded view

1044
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,400
of um how we saw a greater this is

1045
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,119
actually a snippet from our our what we

1046
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,880
call an attack tree

1047
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,720
um so you can see here that this was a

1048
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,079
phishing attack

1049
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,040
um

1050
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,440
came in through the chrome process uh

1051
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,240
installed the tripod downloader

1052
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,960
and then eventually had the infection

1053
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,599
and once that infection happened at some

1054
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,119
point that threat actor is actually

1055
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,200
hands on keyboard issuing commands

1056
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,079
through things like powershell income

1057
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,680
or cobalt strike

1058
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,359
uh medical aid

1059
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,119
right and that's where they're actually

1060
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,520
getting in and doing the dirty work as i

1061
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,280
like to call it right

1062
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,440
they've gotten to where they need to be

1063
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,800
from a service campaign or from the

1064
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,800
malware the commodity malware they got

1065
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,000
now they're going to go and do that

1066
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,240
dirty work and they do hands-on keyboard

1067
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,599
and they do a lot of things notice how

1068
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:04,720
there's a bunch of stuff on the

1069
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,720
right-hand side that have been read

1070
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,440
that's all malicious in some form or

1071
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,400
fashion

1072
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,800
so we hear cyber reason tag all of that

1073
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,040
in the console for you to see

1074
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,839
how things are

1075
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,760
malicious solely based on the color

1076
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,040
and then you can click into each one of

1077
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,800
those and really do an investigation and

1078
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,880
understand what happened before and

1079
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,720
after to really get that understanding

1080
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,079
of visibility

1081
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,599
you can see on the left-hand side here

1082
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,280
that was the

1083
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,079
phishing link click on your bonus bonus

1084
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,680
report yeah click on your annual bonus

1085
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,078
report

1086
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,680
got a lot of users in your environment

1087
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,240
that would click on that don't you

1088
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,680
sure you do

1089
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,440
sure if i got one that said here's your

1090
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,839
commission statement i would think twice

1091
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,599
about clicking on it

1092
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,599
um so yeah so

1093
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,520
make it very easy for these third actors

1094
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,520
to do what they do

1095
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,560
but again

1096
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,320
we have the tools we have the tactics we

1097
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,839
have the techniques to defend against it

1098
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,160
so i want to wrap up here

1099
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,320
and we can open it up for questions

1100
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,800
we can open up for discussion whatever

1101
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,920
you guys want to do to move forward

1102
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,760
but what are we what are we challenged

1103
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,920
with today as i mentioned earlier

1104
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,720
ransomware as a service razz

1105
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,040
you can go buy a campaign

1106
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,400
you can go do it right now and go back

1107
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,240
in bang and issue an hour

1108
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,118
so easy to do

1109
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,079
there's a lot of threat actors out there

1110
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,320
that are focusing on very specific

1111
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,200
organizations targeted attacks it's not

1112
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,280
spray and prey anymore they're really

1113
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,760
focusing on organizations

1114
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,240
that have the money that have the clout

1115
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,839
that have the ip

1116
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,520
that have whatever you know whatever it

1117
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,160
is that they're wanting

1118
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,040
to encrypt it to sell it

1119
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,560
and to make money off of these

1120
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,560
organizations

1121
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,200
there's been a lot of payouts

1122
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,839
unfortunately as more payouts happen

1123
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,000
price goes up right

1124
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,280
supply and demand it's pretty easy

1125
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,480
ransomware's moved to blackmail to where

1126
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,880
they're telling you not only

1127
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,520
do you have to pay but if you don't pay

1128
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,880
we're still going to go make money off

1129
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,280
anyway

1130
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,880
and then as we talked about several

1131
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,839
times government regulations potentially

1132
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,000
insurance companies that are really just

1133
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,800
putting their foot down

1134
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,720
good news is there's some upside right

1135
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,480
it's pretty low and slow these thrown

1136
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,800
after sit there there is time for you to

1137
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,839
defend against it even if they get in

1138
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,079
you just gotta have the tools

1139
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,800
and the people to be able to understand

1140
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,720
how these third archers are evolving and

1141
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,800
to be able to proactively hunt but

1142
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,000
they're sitting there for a while we've

1143
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,480
got time before the actual

1144
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,520
material damage occurs

1145
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,079
another upside is

1146
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,839
most memorable campaigns are not novel

1147
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,839
these are not new they're using the same

1148
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,680
tactics the same techniques

1149
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,760
we know how they're doing it we just got

1150
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,800
to defend it better

1151
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,280
there's a lot of effective techniques

1152
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,640
out there that we're using next

1153
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,000
generation next generation antivirus

1154
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,520
things around behavior-based

1155
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,640
technologies to understand okay someone

1156
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,079
goes to you know this ip in iowa

1157
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,760
every day and all of a sudden they have

1158
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,040
an ip that they're connected to in

1159
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,920
russia okay something's wrong let's

1160
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,520
alert on it let's figure out what's

1161
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,359
happening and let's try to run that

1162
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:35,119
investigation and stop it before it

1163
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,319
causes that material damage

1164
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,839
and then we talked about the very

1165
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,839
beginning just overall good hygiene

1166
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:42,640
right

1167
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,400
clean up snail accounts

1168
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,880
update legacy systems

1169
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,319
figure out what you need to do for your

1170
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,319
perimeter defense

1171
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:51,839
you know i said perimeter defense it's

1172
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,200
probably a touchy subject with a lot of

1173
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,440
people what is the perimeter now we

1174
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,560
don't know

1175
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,319
perimeter's gone to the cloud

1176
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,400
people were working remote how do you do

1177
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,000
it and we start talking about a lot of

1178
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,599
things i could go way deeper on than

1179
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,160
ransomware with zero trust and secure

1180
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,839
access service edge and all these other

1181
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,520
things that we all know about that we

1182
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,440
probably talk about every day

1183
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,200
but there are things that we can do to

1184
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,720
have good hygiene in our environment

1185
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,280
so those are some upsides

1186
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,880
a couple of points here

1187
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,200
to protect your organization

1188
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,839
what are your crown jewels

1189
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,440
unfortunately i talk to a lot of

1190
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,640
customers

1191
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,160
that they don't know the answer to that

1192
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,480
question

1193
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,040
if we think about it from a family

1194
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,640
perspective right at our house what are

1195
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,400
our crowdfunders right probably in a

1196
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,119
safe right it's your passport it's your

1197
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,200
stockpile of cash

1198
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,079
i'm from texas for your guns

1199
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,000
right kids

1200
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,440
right those are your those are the

1201
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,640
things you want to defend against if

1202
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,400
someone were to get in your house right

1203
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,599
we need to do the same thing with our

1204
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,079
environments

1205
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,640
reduce our cyber risk

1206
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,599
again talk about updating legacy systems

1207
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,079
prevent the preventable

1208
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:07,200
that's huge guys huge

1209
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,200
if something's preventable prevent it we

1210
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,200
at cyber reason are a firm believer in

1211
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,200
that we are very good at detection and

1212
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,280
response but we also have a prevention

1213
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,200
stack because if you can prevent it

1214
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,040
let's prevent it let's write a signature

1215
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,640
for it if it's known

1216
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,040
if it's unknown let's use behavior let's

1217
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,400
understand what's happening let's

1218
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,920
prevent it so that way it doesn't even

1219
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,240
happen

1220
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,560
having a detection mindset

1221
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,319
understanding what is going on in your

1222
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:37,599
environment at all times

1223
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,839
user

1224
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,200
training does anybody have a security

1225
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,319
awareness program at their company

1226
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:45,680
yeah

1227
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,079
pretty effective

1228
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:51,040
mostly kind of sort of driver you track

1229
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,480
it

1230
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,040
it's a good point

1231
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,800
but the users you know i think we always

1232
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,200
like to see or like to say that you know

1233
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,400
they're the

1234
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,000
bottom chain of cyber security right

1235
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,079
they're the ones that are there doing

1236
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:06,079
the things right

1237
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:08,160
the cyber things that was a nice little

1238
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,760
plug back too

1239
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,880
um

1240
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,800
user training can be good uh you just

1241
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,079
gotta do it the right way you gotta

1242
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,359
track it

1243
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:16,720
i've actually talked to companies before

1244
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,960
that they've talked about how

1245
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,720
in the event that somebody falls for a

1246
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,119
fishing campaign then they have to do

1247
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,880
some training if it happens a second

1248
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,880
time then something else happens the

1249
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,720
third time four times whatever that then

1250
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,319
bonuses get taken

1251
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,400
i've actually talked to companies where

1252
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,240
they've actually implemented policy to

1253
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,040
fire employees after so much

1254
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,040
so i see some eyes over there there must

1255
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,880
be a manager relationship sitting in the

1256
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,000
back

1257
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,200
um

1258
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,560
we don't want to do that guys you know

1259
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:45,920
we need the people we need to run our

1260
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,400
business but they've also gotta have

1261
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,480
cyber in their mind right we got to make

1262
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,200
sure that we're evangelizing it

1263
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,160
which goes hand in hand with

1264
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,599
communicating the risk of the business

1265
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:58,240
making sure that the board

1266
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,200
the c-levels understand

1267
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,880
the risks of the business

1268
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,160
one company i worked with at one point

1269
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,760
in my career

1270
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,280
and i have not i don't know i can't

1271
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,680
recall that i've seen it happen again

1272
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,680
but the cyber security and the ciso

1273
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,240
reported the cfo

1274
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,520
and i was like

1275
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,720
whoa

1276
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,400
you're not an i.t you're in the

1277
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,960
financial sector now like you're

1278
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,440
you are evangelizing the risks of the

1279
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,960
business from a pure financial

1280
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,800
perspective because the cfo cares about

1281
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,160
the money they care about the bottom

1282
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,319
line well how do you protect the bottom

1283
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:31,839
line when you have good cyber security

1284
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:34,000
practices it was really cool to work

1285
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,400
with them and see how mature they were

1286
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,400
from a data protection perspective from

1287
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,480
a threat prevention perspective as they

1288
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,280
were

1289
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,880
going through digital transformation

1290
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,800
involving to the cloud the things they

1291
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,520
did the vendors they chose all that

1292
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,920
because it was all a financial decision

1293
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,280
but the cfo leaned on the cyber security

1294
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,440
team to make that financial decision it

1295
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,040
wasn't just oh this is the cheapest

1296
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,720
we're gonna buy it oh this is good

1297
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,400
enough because we already own it it

1298
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,400
truly was how do we protect the business

1299
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,920
i must have done this slide before

1300
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,720
because i already talked about

1301
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,960
executives wow i'm just jumping ahead on

1302
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,400
myself here building relations with

1303
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,640
executives is huge presenting at the

1304
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,319
board representing the sea levels make

1305
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,920
sure they understand

1306
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,280
and then last prepare peace time

1307
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,640
when you've got

1308
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,359
down time when you're in between

1309
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,680
when things are not happening when

1310
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,760
things are going good for the company

1311
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,800
that's when you need to have that

1312
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,560
detection mindset

1313
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,880
be proactive understand what's going on

1314
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,480
in your environment

1315
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,960
threat hunt

1316
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,200
implement technologies in your security

1317
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,880
stack that are going to make it easier

1318
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,960
for you down the road

1319
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,119
best time to prepare is when things

1320
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:49,359
aren't going bad right

1321
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:51,359
when things go bad that's when everybody

1322
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:52,720
scrambles

1323
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,959
so prepared

1324
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,680
that's what i got for you guys today

1325
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,800
hopefully that gave you a little bit of

1326
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,960
insight i went a little bit over my time

1327
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,400
technically

1328
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,359
um

1329
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:04,880
they really wanted me to be within 40

1330
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:05,760
minutes

1331
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,240
so we could ask questions but

1332
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,400
now it's your turn questions comments

1333
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,359

yeah so mfa is a big one guys um i think

1341
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,559
we've seen that about several years i

1342
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:48,160

1343
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,520
i didn't actually mention that now i

1344
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,960
think about it but i think mfa is one of

1345
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,880
those big ones right to implement it's

1346
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,720
not just prevention detection but

1347
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,160

1356
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,160
ones um i think that you touched on one

1357
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,760
thing with backups and one thing i want

1358
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,319
to talk about real quick with ransomware

1359
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:07,280
um

1360
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,800
please guys

1361
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,480
don't fall for the

1362
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,359
specific from an endpoint perspective

1363
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:18,480
that on windows machines that there's a

1364
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,119
backup capability called vss everybody

1365
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:22,720
know what that is

1366
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,599
and that you can oh well it's backing

1367
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,119
everything up and you can just restore

1368
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:28,240
to that point

1369
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,839
unfortunately what we're seeing and a

1370
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:31,119
lot of our threat researchers are doing

1371
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,559
a lot of stuff with it right now to

1372
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:34,319
understand how threats are evolving in

1373
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:35,440
this space

1374
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,280
but they're actually deploying malware

1375
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,599
that disables vss

1376
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,240
so even if there's a shot in the dark

1377
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,640
then you can use that backup

1378
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,800
from that shadow copy likely it's been

1379
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,400
disabled or deleted by the malware

1380
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,760
anyway so

1381
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,119
just a little tidbit for you

1382
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:55,040
delete usb backups yeah there's a lot of

1383
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,559
things they can do in the way that they

1384
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:58,240
develop these ranks for so

1385
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,000
be careful when it comes to that because

1386
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,160
there's a lot of things that

1387
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,800
can happen that you may be promised i'm

1388
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,400
not trying to

1389
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,880
wait not

1390
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,520
you know just be careful that through

1391
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,839
what is being said and what's being told

1392
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:15,839
uh but backups is definitely a huge one

1393
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,880
but that's awesome that you've gotten

1394
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,240
some cyber insurance is everybody

1395

1397
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,079
i know i've had conversations with

1398
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:24,160
customers around it but i don't deal

1399
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,520
with it on a day-to-day basis but okay

1400
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,920
