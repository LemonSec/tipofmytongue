for tonight's um and next we have up is

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,720
john boehner he's a security engineer

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,320
from collins he's going to give us a

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,160
great presentation on a risk management

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,240
framework for how i learned to stop

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,640
worrying and love than this as he had a

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,920
series

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,680
the fact he loves that is a problem but

15
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,000

excellent so

19
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,280
i'm going to be careful because my voice

20
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,360
carries a lot so i'm not going to try

21
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,079
and

22
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,320
kill everybody with the audio on the on

23
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,640
youtube

24
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,920
um

25
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,760
basically the first thing i want to do

26
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,920
is you know um it's a little bit of a

27
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,360
fun talking cheek high level

28
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,960
presentation of

29
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,719
uh this

30
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:57,520
special

31
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,039
800 series

32
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,800
we're going to focus on a few of them

33
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,760
but

34
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,000
really this is a very high level

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,720
like the cissp it's a mile wide and

36
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,680
interesting

37
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,080
with a couple of little plugs

38
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,400
so anyway first thing is if you're not

39
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,360
familiar with this 800 series

40
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,840
uh don't worry don't panic

41
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,880
um

42
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,080
i don't want you guys to worry that

43
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,600
we're going to do super technical deep

44
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,759
dives here or also stay

45
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,000
talking about theoretical high-level

46
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,479
controls and start talking about you

47
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,040
know specific baroque parts of one

48
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,799
particular document

49
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,920

i've got about

72
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,680
60 dell certified system expert

73
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,080
solution expert certifications because

74
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,319
every single product has a certification

75
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,440
from dell

76
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,360
um i've got a

77
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,519
former apple certified mac technician

78
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,360
and i've got my pdi possible means i

80
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,040
um

81
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,640
i've been in

82
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,120
the defense aerospace industry for uh

83
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,720
for over a decade

84
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,840
um

85
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,760
the whole time starting with robert

86
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,040
collins and collins aerospace

87
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,760
and now raytheon um

88
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,120
uh i've actually spent over 25 years

89
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,599
working in it getting paid to do it um

90
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,400
so

91
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,080
i'm more of a computer geek than i am a

92
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,400
security geek but i actually really

93
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,200
really like both sides of the fence so

94
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,879
i can help the security people

95
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,360
understand the i.t side and vice versa

96
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,000
which helps smooth things out programs

97
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,280
and getting applications of things

98
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,840
uh i have experience at implementing uh

99
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,560
nist 853 uh control control supply of

100
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,680
programs that have controls from 843

101
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,200
also from 171 which is also called cmmc

102
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,959
defaults

103
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:29,680
or

104
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,840
protection of control and classified

105
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,560
information uh no one been able to

106
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,080
actually tell me if there's an official

107
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,680
that stands on what it's supposed to be

108
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,200
called because

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,920
graduate student uh master of science i

119
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,319

120
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,640
university i've also got my bachelor's

121
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,959
from there and cyber operations and

122

certificates and i also like riding uh

126

recumbent tricycle around all over the

127
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,840
place uh even though

128
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,840
they talk fat dude and i don't like

129
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,919
uh particularly uh moving on here real

130
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,639
quick um let's pretend this presentation

131
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,479
is kind of uh geared towards people that

132
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,320
are looking for uh items in their

133
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,479
information insurance programs or cyber

134
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,720
security programs as well as for people

135
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,919
who might be interested in careers in

136
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,120
federal service to the defense

137
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,360
industrial base health care critical

138
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,639
infrastructure

139
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,000
state or federal service and most

140
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,560
assuredly cyber security

141
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,400
i'm going to cover uh

142
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,080
cover a few things here and talk about

143
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,919
what nist is a little bit of their

144
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,720
history uh start talking about what in

145
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,759
this special publication 800 series is

146
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,680
and then we're going to dive into uh the

147
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,919
first one which uh it's called wristband

148
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,360
framework

149
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,840
then we'll jump into

150
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,840
171 181

151
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,199
some other publications that are really

152
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,800
cool and there's some very nice tools

153
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,639
that are out there that if your

154
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,800
organization

155
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,039
is looking for a really solid framework

156
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,039
and series of technical publications out

157
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,720
there to help you improve your cyber

158
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,639
security compliance

159
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,080
in there or you have to fight with a

160
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,360
whole bunch of different ones like say

161
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,479
you've got pci xss you've got hipaa and

162
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,320
you've also got some you've also got

163
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,680
some federal contracts that you're

164
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,560
supporting or subcontracting to

165
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,320
uh it's a ton of different frameworks

166
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,280
but the nice thing is that nist 853

167
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,880
super machines all of them

168
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,759
so you can actually map to your iso

169
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,440
truly fun

170
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,759
but the department of defense

171
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,680
in particular provides a lot of really

172
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,000
cool tools for on technical

173
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,960
implementation and validation

174
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,080
uh throughout all federal service

175
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,600
and some other cool tools and helpful

176
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,120
resources and then i have a little bit

177
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,600
of a quick contest before we jump to q a

178
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,919
and i will apologize i might be going 90

179
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,160
miles an hour if i'm going too fast just

180
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,479
throw something at me or say hey

181
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,360
i'll try to slow down

182
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,280
um so first thing i want to talk about

183
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,400
is what is nist uh nist is the national

184
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,880
institute of standards and technology

185
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,840
um

186
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,120
this is an organization this is a

187
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,759
federally funded organization that is

188
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,840
responsible for

189
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,919
research applying research into physical

190
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,000
sciences material sciences cyber

191
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,800
security quantum and a lot of other

192
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,000
really cool

193
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,639
peer research applications

194
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,960
they are also responsible for several

195
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,160
standards such as the federal

196
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,960
information processing standard fips

197
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,199
fisma uh they're responsible for

198
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,199
measurements in weight standardization

199
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,960
and maintaining those

200
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,639
they have six national laboratories

201
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,039
across the country uh that are devoted

202
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,880
specifically towards advancing science

203
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,240
and growing categories uh not

204
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,960
for in general they do partner with

205
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,400
companies a lot of organizations like

206
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,000
dartmouth stuff like that but they are

207
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,160
straight a pure science and standards

208
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,800
organization

209
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,440
the nist special publication 800 to the

210
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,880
s p 800

211
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,639
is a large volume and still growing

212
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,160
volume of

213
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,080
a library of documents that are

214
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,960
published and updated quite regularly by

215
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,520
nist who forms a joint task force to

216
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,599
have several people

217
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,360
that are specialists with inside the

218
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,520
government and then they bring in

219
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,880
academia

220
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,680
industry and other professionals to help

221
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,520
comment and help build these documents

222
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,560
so

223
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,960
these are cover all kinds of

224
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,879
stuff from information assurance

225
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,080
security privacy

226
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,199
the sp 800 series has a direct mapping

227
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,639
of its controls to iso 27001

228
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,039
uh so that way if you are having to deal

229
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,639
with international compliance which is

230
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,960
generally iso

231
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,360
everything has mappings to iso so if you

232
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,440
have to deal with a particular european

233
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,680
framework or japan's framework or

234
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,919
australia's you you can you could take

235
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,919
this back and tie it to iso and bring it

236
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,599
right back down into your country to the

237
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,639
other country you've got to make your

238
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,000
compliance on

239
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,080
in addition there's all kinds of other

240
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,840
really cool stuff like container harmony

241
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,400
kubernetes incident response planning

242
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,080
assessment zero trust identity

243
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,080
management uh there's there's a whole

244
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,640
document just about passwords on on how

245
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,240
to implement the

246
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,360
proper solid secure password policy uh

247
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,200
for whether basically your regular users

248
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,800
and your privileged users of your system

249
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
administrators um

250
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,440
pki biometrics and multi-factor

251
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,640
authentication

252
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,480
if there's something information

253
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,320
assurance in a particular category

254
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,480
especially on the site on the ip side

255
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,320
there's probably a missed document for

256
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,399
it

257
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,560
one of the big documents is

258
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,800
837 which is called risk management

259
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
framework and this is a

260
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,279
policy and architectural life cycle

261
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,320
framework that is specifically designed

262
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,880
to have a continuous life cycle of

263
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,959
information systems

264
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,959
for an organization

265
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,399
and there are other supporting

266
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,839
organizations there's other supporting

267
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,080
documents that

268
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,600
apply

269
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,200
in this but it's a

270
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,240
it's a six slash seven step

271
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,880
program where you basically start off by

272
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,480
figuring out

273
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,560
categorize the information system and

274
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,440
then you select your controls based off

275
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,920
of a series of different

276
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,880
uh there's uh

277
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,120
20 different categories they can select

278
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,800
and there are a bunch of different

279
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,600
overlays and say hey i need to have a

280
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,240
moderate level of confidentiality a low

281
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,080
level of integrity and low level

282
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,480
availability or if you have something

283
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,720
that's ultra critical where

284
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,600
um

285
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,200
such as like you know an emergency or a

286
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,920
spot like a 9-1-1 dispatch center

287
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,120
uh for a region or things like that

288
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,200
you've got to have high confidentiality

289
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,959
you have high integrity high

290
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,200
availability it helps you pick and

291
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,440
choose the controls you need to put

292
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,760
on into your information insurance

293
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,519
programs to make sure that you're able

294
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,320
to

295
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,920
properly

296
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,760
um

297
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,519
second year

298
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,120
the senior moment as i believe it's

299
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,640
called um or defined by zero um

300
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,720
basically select your controls and then

301
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,240
the next step you get implementing those

302
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,399
controls as you create your implicit in

303
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,120
your information system or you begin to

304
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,760
upgrade an existing one

305
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,360
um and then what you do is you will

306
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,279
assess those controls against what you

307
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,720
have implemented

308
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,240
and this is generally where you would

309
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,000
have uh on the government side you would

310
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,360
have like a security control assessor um

311
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,600
from that that is that reports to your

312
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,200
authorizing official with a guy that

313
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,800
actually gives you permission that the

314
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,320
person that gives you

315
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,399
allows you to actually

316
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,320
do the upgrade and run your information

317
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,800
systems process data and execute your

318
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,760
mission

319
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,680
objectives

320
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,360
that person will come out

321
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,920
and sometimes either physically

322
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,200
or remotely

323
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,680
review your system your controls

324
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,440
your policies your procedures your

325
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,600
standards and basically they look at the

326
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,480
whole the whole

327
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,640
wow i'm really good at uh failing to

328
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,240
find words from them and look at the

329
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,079
whole ecosystem

330
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:34,959
of

331
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,720
of the environment so it's not just

332
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,079
obviously going to look at your group

333
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,560
policy and the world that you're seeing

334
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,760
they're going to look at well they're

335
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,360
going to want to see your policies and

336
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,120
procedures and just make sure that you

337
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,200
do have a proper incident response plan

338
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,399
that you are properly auditing a lot of

339
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,079
your systems to make sure that there is

340
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,399
some a bad actor or threat actors

341
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,839
compromise the computer you're able to

342
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,920
protect it and respond to it and

343
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,839
eliminate that threat and then repeat

344
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:00,800
and then

345
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,240
take action to

346
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,600
prevent that from happening in the

347
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,639
future

348
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,560
additionally then you have to

349
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,680
basically

350
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,680
after you assess the controls you're

351
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,200
authorizing official

352
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,560
that might be your ciso in a

353
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,920
commercial

354
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,200
enterprise

355
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,160
will give will approve the system to be

356
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,920
brought into production or be given an

357
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,760
authority and operate

358
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,920
and then you will monitor the system and

359
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,920
then at that point

360
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,320
uh you'll begin the process again

361
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,680
making sure that you've got the right

362
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,279
controls you've got the right policies

363
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,200
you've got the right procedures

364
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,639
and you've got then you've got the right

365
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,120
people tools

366
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,480
and

367
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,480
equipment in place in order to make sure

368
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,240
that

369
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,720
your organization is running securely

370
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,639
and safely

371
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,160
but that's what

372
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,680
our that's what risk management

373
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,160
framework that document is it is

374
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,839
unfortunately it is one of the more

375
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,079
baroque documents that this has

376
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,200
published

377
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,880
but overall um there's excellent uh

378
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,519
reviews out there on like on youtube

379
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,839
and they really nice they can help you

380
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,839
explain how to explain mountain some of

381
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,040
the different pieces that are a little

382
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,240
bit hard to

383
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,279
grasp sometimes but overall this gives

384
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,120
you a really solid life cycle to build

385
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,279
off of lots of reference information and

386
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,399
documents

387
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,519
that helps your your organization refine

388
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,079
and improve its uh information assurance

389
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,519
program continuously

390
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,120
the next big

391
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,079
chunky document in this v100 series is a

392
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,200
853 revision 5. there's actually three

393
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,360
different parts of 853 there's 853

394
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,120
853 a and then b

395
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,760
so 853 is a vendor-neutral

396
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,240
set of controls and enhancements to

397
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,839
those controls spread across 20

398
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,920
different families which include things

399
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,600
like auditing

400
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,240
physical security

401
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,959
identity management immediate protection

402
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,279
system of procurement

403
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,199
and other and all these different

404
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,519
controls throughout the whole family uh

405
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,519
total if you were to go look at every

406
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,959
single one of them there's 190 controls

407
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,720
and enhancements all together throughout

408
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,360
fitness 853 document

409
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,560
does not mean that

410
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,560
every single control is required to be

411
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,160
implemented

412
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,360
they are they have a number of

413
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,839
overlays that are selected based on the

414
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,760
sensitivity of your data

415
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,000
the importance of the mission so if you

416
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,839
can't if you have to be operating 24 7

417
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,079
there are different controls that you

418
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,600
can select if you have pii there's a

419
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,360
privacy overlay designed to protect

420
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,720
people's private

421
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,040
uh pii from exposure or manipulation

422
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,560
um

423
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,760
there's

424
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,120
many many different overlappings

425
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,360
basically you look at your cia

426
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,480
confidentially you take your

427
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,639
availability and you select

428
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,320
the amount of electrical controls you

429
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,320
need to have on there

430
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,880
many systems you would find

431
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,600
in

432
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,040
federal certain federal information

433
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,560
systems are generally defined as

434
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,040
moderate low level

435
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,040
and even the low level of integrity and

436
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,880
availability is pretty robust

437
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,079
additionally there includes it calls out

438
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:24,959
other

439
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,120
documents and provides guidance not only

440
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,199
so they'll just give you a control it

441
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,279
gives you control and discusses it and

442
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,800
gives you it gives you some information

443
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,639
to work off of it but it's a vendor

444
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,880
neutral solution neutral

445
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,560
explanation which

446
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,360
makes it sometimes really helpful

447
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,120
and sometimes really difficult when they

448
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,279
have to specifically walk around and

449
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,880
avoid saying you need to use the 8021x

450
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,320
to control your network

451
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,720
and things like that um

452
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,639
again there's the mapping to iso 27001

453
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,680
and uh in addition to having like the

454
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,199
miss privacy overlay uh there is a

455
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,959
document of the

456
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,639
part a of 853 tells you it provides

457
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,680
guidance on how to assess those controls

458
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,680
uh in your information systems and in

459
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,000
your organization and then part b helps

460
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,480
you define your base of your control

461
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,800
based loans

462
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,839
and this here is an example of control

463
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:26,800
this is

464
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,440
the audit family this one's security and

465
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,320
privacy engineering principles

466
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,560
it's broken down to provides the control

467
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,880
text which is actually a very small

468
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,480
chunk of it then it goes into a

469
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,920
it provides

470
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,759
additional information and then it also

471
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,680
talks about other controls that apply to

472
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,440
this control

473
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,120
and then at the very bottom you'll also

474
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,639
see that there's an enhancement and

475
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,639
enhancements are optional most in most

476
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,040
cases unless an overlay particularly

477
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,480
calls out an enhancement or the

478
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,000
organization your organization's

479
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,560
leadership determines that enhancement

480
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,440
is needed for a reason to support the

481
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,119
business in its security states

482
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,119
next year this is just a quick list of

483
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,079
how

484
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,520
the different

485
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,199
controls in 853 map directly to

486
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,119
different iso 27001 controls

487
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,799
so this lets you

488
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,799
easily deal with

489
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,559
other

490
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,880
other security framework

491
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,320
protections that you need to have for

492
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,120
say you've got you've got an office in

493
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,160
france you've got to meet the european

494
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,000
union's security

495
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,480
and privacy controls like gdpr and stuff

496
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,600
like that

497
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,080
this document allows you to go hey we're

498
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,400
an interfaith organization here's how we

499
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,919
map our controls

500
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,640
here's how our controls mapped iso

501
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,799
so that way when you go work with your

502
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,880
security personnel have to go meet with

503
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,360
regulators in france they're able to

504
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,160
speak to a continent to the iso

505
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,400
documentation even though you're all

506
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,240
you're set up and built as an

507
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,039
organization

508
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,080
um

509
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,200
jumping to

510
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,200
another one this one's actually probably

511
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,840
so if you do anything with your

512
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,919
organization deals anything with uh

513
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,760
federal contracting with the department

514
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,919
of defense or subcontracting

515
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,200
uh since 2014 every single new contract

516
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,039
amount that is required

517
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,760
to plot a uncontrolled unclassified

518
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,200
information

519
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,760
uh to be protected um

520
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,760
and the controls are in 800-171

521
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,640
this is also called d-bars or cmmc

522
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,640
um or c-u-r

523
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,960
uh this is 853's

524
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,880
little brother um

525
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,120
there's a lot less controls in here

526
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,799
they're laid out completely differently

527
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,919
but they have direct mappings to 853

528
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,600
and instead of having it'll get up to

529
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,760
almost 1200 controls

530
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,880
you only have 121 controls to look at

531
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,280
and this includes physical security of

532
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,679
data integrity authentication we call

533
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,039
about specific things like using

534
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,520
multi-factor authentication some very

535
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,760
common sense stuff that

536
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,799
some people

537
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,240
owning a pipeline place they don't know

538
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,880
whether that is but uh didn't obviously

539
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,400
obviously we're doing vulnerability

540
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
assessment assessment and monitoring

541
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,480
ensuring your computers are meeting a

542
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,440
compliance baseline as well i mean

543
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,880
there's some excellent stuff in here

544
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,640
some that will obviously come across to

545
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,799
some organization leaders as common

546
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:31,760
sense

547
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,400
but um it's spelled out here so that way

548
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,840
it's part of developing your information

549
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,960
assurance security

550
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,160
program

551
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,840
you can make sure that you are meeting

552
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,360
your compliance objectives and your

553
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,120
documentation because some of the

554
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,440
biggest problems with that that

555
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,559
organizations have especially in it and

556
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,720
security organizations is lack of

557
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,280
documentation uh that never happens

558
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,480
we've never had a problem with

559
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,559
documentation not existing for something

560
00:19:58,559 --> 00:19:59,840
especially when it's a really old

561
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,559
solution right

562
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,440
basically the other thing about 800 uh

563
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,799
171 is uh it doesn't matter how far away

564
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,440
from the fl from the flight pole you are

565
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,000
um if you are doing if you're creating a

566
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,880
widget that goes in a thing that goes in

567
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,320
duplicate that goes in a plane

568
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,799
uh for for the air force

569
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,960
you were bound you were required to

570
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,559
follow these controls for anything

571
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,640
regarding that information

572
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,240
but it might be considered controlled

573
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,480
by uh by the government you're

574
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,080
responsible for meeting these compliance

575
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,080
requirements within your organization on

576
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,840
the systems that process that

577
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,039
information

578
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,760
and failure can result in empowerment

579
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,240
from federal contracts

580
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,600
it's determined to be malicious

581
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,640
which means you can be removed from any

582
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,720
current contract and you're forbidden

583
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,679
from

584
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,679
for a period of time up to including

585
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,720
forever for me to participate or bid on

586
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,640
any other contract federal government

587
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,840
again

588
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,960
so this

589
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,400
compliance with this

590
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,480
is a really serious business for any

591
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,039
subcontractor or organization that

592
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,960
contracts to a department of defense

593
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,760
entity

594
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,679
and that's really kind of covered pretty

595
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,200
much most of the

596
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,760
uh important documents uh there's one

597
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,360
here i forgot to put a slide in for

598
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,240
called nist 800 181

599
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,840
and this is also called the nice

600
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,320
framework and this actually

601
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,120
is

602
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,400
been a big deal

603
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,159
because for the longest time federal

604
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,760
service had a huge problem with

605
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,120
aligning i.t and security roles and

606
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,559
responsibilities and job titles

607
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,000
one person who

608
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,120
could be a

609
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,719
principal system administrator

610
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,240
in one organization was a

611
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,480
was a single was a systems engineer in

612
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,320
another organization and this created a

613
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,320
huge problem

614
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,280
with trying to make sure that people

615
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,280
were moving that move between federal

616
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,840
between different roles in federal

617
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,760
service and contracting with industry no

618
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,640
one

619
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,919
you had to know

620
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,159
the culture of every single unique

621
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:19,600
organization within the federal

622
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,840
government to understand what their i.t

623
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,679
roles were and their security rules were

624
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,679
this created a huge problem

625
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,799
so

626
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,280
about 10 years ago they began working on

627
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,320
this nice framework and this came out in

628
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,159
2014 i believe

629
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,960
the nice framework

630
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,039
centralized all that underneath and

631
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,640
provided

632
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,400
very strong

633
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,320
job roles and responsibilities

634
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,159
certification requirements for those

635
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,159
roles and responsibilities

636
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,240
career path progressions for those roles

637
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,400
and responsibilities

638
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,320
and really generally set a solid

639
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,159
groundwork for federal information

640
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,480
systems on the information assurance and

641
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,159
the technical side

642
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,679
um which was something that had been

643
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,840
sorely lacking

644
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,080
and that is that document

645
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,840
is

646
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,159
excellent uh for organizations that

647
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,799
might have absorbed other companies

648
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,120
um from an hr perspective and from a

649
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,720
security perspective

650
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,720
uh one organization's engineer might be

651
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,600
another assistance administrator

652
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,520
i've seen organizations that had tier

653
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,640
one engineers who were helping or phone

654
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,880
center help desk kids who were in

655
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,039
college uh working on their computer

656
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,640
science degrees in other organizations

657
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,000
you weren't an engineer until you had a

658
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,280
four-year degree

659
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,080
um and um

660
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,880
sorry

661
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,919
they had

662
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,360
basically if you didn't have a four-year

663
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,679
degree in the stem

664
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,559
field

665
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,640
you couldn't be an engineer

666
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,480
and this became a

667
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,360
still problem so

668
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,679
centralizing and condensing your job

669
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,600
roles and getting them all in the flat

670
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,360
role makes it a lot easier for you to

671
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,360
speak around your organization

672
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,880
especially as the organizations grow

673
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,360
larger and larger

674
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,240
um but that's covering

675
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,640
nist 800 181

676
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,520
um

677
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,600
some very cool things i'd like to talk

678
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,360
about is some other cool

679
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,840
features tools that are available uh

680
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,440
regardless of whether or not you're in

681
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,200
this organization and you're looking and

682
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,760
you're just looking for ways to fund to

683
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,440
save yourself organization time from

684
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,880
having to develop

685
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,559
hardened

686
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,080
tools to make sure that your systems are

687
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,520
secure

688
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,559
from a control perspective and from the

689
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,880
security settings one of these is a team

690
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,440
baby yoda this is a department of the

691
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,880
air force

692
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,360
chief software officer office office

693
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,679
which i know sounds really weird

694
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,320
put together a team called platform one

695
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,760
and they've worked in the open source

696
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,480
community with many vendors out there

697
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,080
who have gone out and went through the

698
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,240
effort of hardening

699
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,760
creating a container orchestration

700
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,960
platform

701
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,679
that leverages

702
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,279
standards open solutions where possible

703
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,720
and they've worked with vendors to

704
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,720
provide things like the red hat

705
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,960
universal base image

706
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,080
at no cost to everyone

707
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,440
as well as

708
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,679
they they run the first organizations in

709
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,279
dod to implement a full zero trust

710
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,400
approach

711
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,480
to their to their deployments whether it

712
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,039
was on-prem or in cloud

713
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,240
um

714
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,480
and basically they build off of the uh

715
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,200
they they helped work on the kubernetes

716
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,120
and um

717
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,520
container hardening guys missed

718
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,600
um so these guys have worked really hard

719
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,559
to

720
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,760
uh

721
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,039
to develop a system to create pardon

722
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,440
containers for things like git lab

723
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,320
uh atlassian tools

724
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,799
and nginx and all these other different

725
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,440
services that you need in order for your

726
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,520
your software your software engineers

727
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,200
your software developers

728
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,120
to have to build uh tool tool chains and

729
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,039
environments such as highly scalable

730
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,880
desktop house pipelines and devops

731
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,200
pipelines uh being able to do

732
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,520
model-based system engineering

733
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,400
and

734
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,320
being able to manage

735
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,960
uh manage having things be able to be

736
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,600
developed and pushed rapidly tested with

737
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,080
high levels of assurance that that the

738
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,679
code is secure

739
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,679
it executes properly and you're able to

740
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,240
do digital testing in simulated

741
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,240
environments so that you can look you

742
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,440
can actually commit code and 15 minutes

743
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,880
later you know whether or not that code

744
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,240
is going to break you down from your

745
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,320
prod environment when you need to put

746
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,640
without ever having to push the prod and

747
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,720
this also gives you excellent a b

748
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,720
testing and things like that and for

749
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,760
people outside uh so people inside

750
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,360
federal and final system of the federal

751
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,960
information systems

752
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,880
this was

753
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,200
this was uh this was literally a

754
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,120
groundbreaking thing for them because i

755
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,080
know that companies like flickr and

756
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,080
uh instagram have been doing things with

757
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,640
devops for years over a decade in some

758
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,480
cases

759
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,679
but for

760
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,159
on the federal on the federal side

761
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,799
this was this was this was this was

762
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,120
totally new this was like light speed

763
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,720
they they

764
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,279
they went through and fought for a long

765
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,600
time and they got an accredited

766
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,600
department of defense wide reciprocity

767
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,520
on a continuous ato or authority to

768
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,679
operate

769
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:26,960
that allows

770
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,120
programs once they've been approved to

771
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,200
use this platform

772
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,399
to bring devops and devsecops and their

773
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,640
security development and operations into

774
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,159
single pipelines

775
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,600
and it's

776
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,600
it's really done a tremendous amount of

777
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,399
good

778
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,480
in there and the best part is everyone

779
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,520
in here

780
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,559
can access all that knowledge and

781
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:49,840
all their hard work those aren't

782
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,600
containers for free

783
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,960
it doesn't mean that you're going to

784
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,200
have licenses to use all of it because

785
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,600
lasting life's taken is like splunk like

786
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,200
taking large amounts of organizations

787
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,240
money into their own bank accounts

788
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,080
next thing is the defense information

789
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,360
systems

790
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,919
agency or disa

791
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,480
releases a bunch of

792
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,159
templates and

793
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,399
guided guidance called aesthetic secure

794
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,640
technical implementation guides

795
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,360
this is documentation and

796
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,640
xml

797
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,919
based

798
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,320
files that allow you to

799
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,360
follow a process to harden systems and

800
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,600
you can tailor that hardening and test

801
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,640
those systems using other tools like

802
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,960
scap which is a security compliance

803
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,120
automation protocol

804
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,720
which there is one that the federal

805
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,720
government releases off the

806
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,799
public.cyber.mill site called scap

807
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,399
there's another open source group called

808
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,678
the openstack workbench

809
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,799
these things like cisco

810
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,520
netapp emc appliances

811
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,679
generic web applications this stuff

812
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:00,559
really

813
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,559
it helps you look through and evaluate

814
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,640
at a technical level controls and it

815
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,399
ties these controls

816
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,480
the detect types those settings

817
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,640
of those argument settings back to

818
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,799
specific controls inside of this

819
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,440
documentation so that way

820
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,440
you can you understand what's there and

821
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,279
if your organization says oh i can't

822
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,120
implement this particular technical

823
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,600
control do you understand where it's

824
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,159
where it is on on the policy side where

825
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:27,200
you're missing

826
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,520
what control you're missing and why

827
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,760
and so that way you can communicate to

828
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,440
upper leadership

829
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,000
hey we can't we can't enable this thing

830
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,640
because we can't enable fix mode on red

831
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,399
hat for our developers because they make

832
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,880
kernel modules and if you try to compile

833
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,720
a kernel module in fips mode it breaks

834
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,039
the kernel module and compile

835
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,080
so

836
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,320
you have you have to take that control

837
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,559
you turn that into business management

838
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,240
language and you can take that to

839
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,000
leadership okay

840
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,799
if we enable this control we can't make

841
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,880
widgets for the software program

842
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,640
and that's and that's

843
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,159
actually extremely helpful because

844
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,640
sometimes our biggest problem that for

845
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,760
analysts

846
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,679
and systems

847
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,679
is converting

848
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,039
the

849
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,039
technical reason why

850
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,600
we have to do something into a

851
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,799
compliance or business justification

852
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,880
it's often sometimes could be very hard

853
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,039
to convince leadership who does not

854
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,200
understand geek

855
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,679
that we can't um

856
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,279
why something can't be done or why

857
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,840
something needs to be

858
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,760
done oh there's my nice completely put

859
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,840
in the wrong order so this is the nice

860
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,880
framework

861
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,960
this this framework

862
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,480
is um

863
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,039
also being used to one more thing itself

864
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,120
being used to help define and they're

865
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,640
working with universities and other

866
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,520
educated academic organizations

867
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,200
to help drive

868
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,279
skill sets needed for specific job rules

869
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,000
such as society nsa and the department

870
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
of public security both

871
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
have have certified programs of

872
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,760
excellence for cyber operations and

873
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,200
cyber defense

874
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,039
um and

875
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,080
that means that those organization

876
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,159
academic organizations are working with

877
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,519
federal government

878
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,720
to address specific needs

879
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,159
uh for

880
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,200
um

881
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,000
for lack of skill sets

882
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,320
and educate and educational needs for

883
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,399
students so that when they finish

884
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:30,080
their degree

885
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,159
they are prepared to enter the workforce

886
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,320
and have the right skills

887
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,399
needed to not just work in federal

888
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,640
service but to be solid cyber security

889
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,399
professionals whether they're whether

890
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,159
the red team blue team purple team or

891
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,640
green team

892
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,679
um uh this next slide here is going to

893
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,240
talk about a few things here um

894
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,679
the defense counter intelligence

895
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,799
security administration or dcsa um has

896
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,640
an assessment and authorization process

897
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,679
manual

898
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:58,640
um

899
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,720
as well as um

900
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,720
that is specifically geared towards

901
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,880
classified information systems

902
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,559
additionally they are responsible

903
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:07,919
publishing another document called the

904
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,200
joint special access program

905
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,320
implementation guide or the json

906
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,279
and

907
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,679
what these documents really are is they

908
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,799
take the nisk 853

909
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,200
lay out all the controls and then

910
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,760
provide additional guidance

911
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,840
so you can go look at these controls

912
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,640
in 853 or you can go look at a very cool

913
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,480
spreadsheet in the dab

914
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,240
and you can see all the controls all the

915
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,760
enhancements all the cool stuff that's

916
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,640
at 853 which is a 400 page long document

917
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,640
or you can look at a 23 page spreadsheet

918
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,039
have everything laid out in filterable

919
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,960
columns and he can go through there and

920
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,519
tell you how uh what dcsa recommends

921
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,120
from a cyber security perspective to

922
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,600
meet this control or from a policy

923
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,799
perspective

924
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,720
and also how often we should be auditing

925
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,960
it from their perspective again here

926
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,880
towards national national security

927
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,360
information systems so take that with a

928
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,880
grain of salt if you don't have to worry

929
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,200
about having collateral programs uh at

930
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,640
your organization

931
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,399
you can dial up that obviously if you

932
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,320
think that you will still meet the risk

933
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,679
tolerance of your organization

934
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,799
um some next slide right here is a bunch

935
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,120
of tools that uh

936
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,039
have been extremely helpful in meeting

937
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:19,919
our

938
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:21,360
leading cyber security compliance

939
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,440
requirements in this special publication

940
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,480
800.

941
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,159
on the paint side you've got things like

942
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,120
nessus tenable and exposed

943
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,960
those are great vulnerability and

944
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,200
compliance skating suites they're

945
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,720
expensive they're really expensive

946
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,880
not slunker

947
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,399
at last student level but they're

948
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,480
they're pricing but the nice thing is

949
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,080
they have all the stigs already baked in

950
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,760
everything so that when you go scan a

951
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,519
computer or a web app it's going to

952
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,279
report back what your compliance level

953
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,720
is in real time when that scan happens

954
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,320
so it helps you show not only

955
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,000
vulnerabilities in your system it shows

956
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,840
your compliance standpoint

957
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,640
from up from an operational level and

958
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,120
things so that really helps the

959
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,799
organization especially the security

960
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,120
organization make sure that stuff is

961
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,800
uh make sure that things are actually

962
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,239
configured the way they need to

963
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,399
reinforce the baseline it enhances your

964
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,359
audit

965
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,320
splunk another great organization as

966
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,399
said before by the previous speaker that

967
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,159
likes transferring your money to their

968
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,800
market their of their accounts

969
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,639
they actually have a really good product

970
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,520
and it's very modular and capable

971
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,040
and they have on-prem and cloud

972
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,639
solutions so depending on what your

973
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,239
organization needs

974
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,679
are

975
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,918
and if you need a very strong robust

976
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:36,879
seating

977
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,440
they're one of the better ones out there

978
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,000
um veeam there to that veritas backup

979
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,239
exactly excellent backup tools

980
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,399
uh and i'll both implement fips 140

981
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,719
140-2

982
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,879
encryption verification verified the

983
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,399
crypto menus

984
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,560
so that you have a high level of

985
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,399
assurance that your

986
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,040
backups are protected at rest

987
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,720
in case someone were to walk away with a

988
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,400
tape or a hard drive with their backups

989
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,480
there's going to be a very

990
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,599
they're going to have to have nation

991
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,920
state level capabilities to craft that

992
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,280
encryption

993
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,440
uh some other tools admin arsenal makes

994
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,520
a product called pdq deployment pdq

995
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,839
inventory this is fantastic for small

996
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,119
businesses

997
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,720
um

998
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,720
it makes you it lets you be able to

999
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,000
talk to all your windows computers

1000
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,640
deploy patches and play software

1001
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,240
it makes your life a lot easier when you

1002
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,599
can't do things like sccm or managing

1003
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:30,800
some of those other

1004
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,240
tools out there

1005
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,040
and then obviously antivirus

1006
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,839
companies like mcafee sofa semantic on

1007
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,520
the free site

1008
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,119
uh you can get from this of the stick

1009
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,560
viewer

1010
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,040
open scout workbench group essentials so

1011
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,320
if you're a small business with less

1012
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,200
than

1013
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,359
15 or 25

1014
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:52,560
um devices uh you can get nessus for

1015
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,680
free

1016
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,839
uh plan maybe use another free antivirus

1017
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:56,960
tool

1018
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,440
visual studio code because

1019
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,000
it's just fantastic colleen guidra for

1020
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,920
reverse engineering remix for reverse

1021
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,280
engineering

1022
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,160
bitlocker and lux are fantastic tools

1023
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,000
and bitlocker is

1024
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,119
fix validating as is lux for red hat and

1025
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,400
send os

1026
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,839
because they use the same crypto engine

1027
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,839
plus platform one if your organization

1028
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,160
is doing container orchestration and you

1029
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,440
right now you have to pull on your stuff

1030
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,880
from dr hub

1031
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,280
um look at platform one you can leverage

1032
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,920
in a great container there's some great

1033
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,160
capabilities there and it's free to pull

1034
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,040
indicators from them

1035
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,880
also

1036
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,240
we've got

1037
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,760
organizations that we can go look for

1038
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,599
nist obviously

1039
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,520
u.s search

1040
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,079
nsa publishes a tremendous amount of

1041
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,480
really cool documentation

1042
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,359
with commercial solutions for classified

1043
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,280
the cnssi

1044
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,480
and the cross-domain solution council

1045
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,680
as well as general i.t security

1046
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,599
publications and then we have the

1047
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,359
national vulnerability database and

1048
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,240
minor cpe database

1049
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,560
and then i have one

1050
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,720
contest

1051
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,320
um

1052
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,920
first off thank you for everyone that's

1053
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,400
in public safety and also for those who

1054
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,280
serve

1055
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,599
uh and if anyone knows who this person

1056
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,400
is in this picture please let me know

1057
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,800
and i will buy you soda

1058
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,040
for an adult beverage if that's if

1059
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,599
you're of age

1060
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,200
and

1061
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,599
our nation's capital is named after it

1062
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,599
that's

1063
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,839
so

1064
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,440
sorry i'm a bit of a history geek

1065
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,720
correct the colombians that got up and

1066
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,320
did what used to be

1067
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,119
before the civil war was the spirit of

1068
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,119
america she was a she was a roman

1069
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,320
goddess of liberty

1070
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,440
and

1071
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,079
washington dc was named after her with

1072
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,200
the district of columbia

1073
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,599
and now he gets my really cool hacker

1074
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:05,680
picture i found off google

1075
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,920
uh does anyone have any questions i know

1076
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,520
i just went through a ton of information

1077
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,160
very quickly

1078
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,839
okay i'm just disappointed you didn't

1079
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:18,320
transition from columbia into rocky

1080
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,640
horror

1081
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,720
it's just a step to the left there you

1082
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,879
go

1083
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,200
so um

1084
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,880
so how long uh

1085
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,880
organizations have been using this and

1086
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,800
are about uh

1087
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,320
so what kind of timeline might they be

1088
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,720
looking at so rmf came out in

1089
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,800
2014 it was when it got finalized but it

1090
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,599
was in draft for almost two years

1091
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,440
because there was a

1092
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,240
before rmf existed

1093
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,359
there was a

1094
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,920
there was the common criteria

1095
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,920
which still kind of exists but doesn't

1096
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,480
really exist anymore and then there was

1097
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,520
the odaa or um and i can't know what

1098
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,640
that acronym

1099
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:09,520
stands for but the oda process was

1100
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,480
was was there and this 853 existed but

1101
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,240
there was no real framework around life

1102
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,200
cycles of information assurance

1103
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,359
include for physical or

1104
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,160
cyber uh prior to that within the

1105
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,920
federal government organizations and

1106
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,599
different different departments would

1107
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,240
have their own policies about how things

1108
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,160
were supposed to be run

1109
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,320
dod you know had the rainbow series and

1110
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,680
then the common criteria

1111
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,480
but

1112
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,240
no one really had

1113
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,640
no one no one ever all these different

1114
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,800
organizations had different

1115
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,599
frameworks and policy guidance and all

1116
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,440
these different things and then this was

1117
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,480
brought in

1118
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,240
uh to

1119
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,839
centralize all that

1120
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,480
common framework for all for all federal

1121
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,800
for all federal information systems

1122
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,000
um

1123
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,800
so 2014 has been armed at land of the

1124
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,240
oda process not officially

1125
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,280
was not retired by dcsa which was then

1126
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,760
called defense security services

1127
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,319
wasn't retired until 2017 for some

1128
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,560
certain information systems

1129
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,440
the process has

1130
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,760
significantly changed

1131
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,839
with rmf oda was literally a checklist

1132
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,520
and

1133
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,200
a lot of it was

1134
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,359
not it was not as robust there was not

1135
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,920
as much focus on my cycle it was more

1136
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,760
about do you mean these

1137
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,599
can you check checkbox

1138
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,119
at some point for some systems

1139
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,560
alrighty i think we're going to have

1140
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,119
some time back at this point

1141
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,520
um i this flight deck is available for

1142
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,800
anyone who wants to get a hold of me

1143
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,119

realize that microsoft had a critical

1158
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,200
vulnerability or 13 of them they patched

1159
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,839
last month
