00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,920
we'll

33
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,680
go over a bit today

34
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,479
uh some of the work was like basically

35
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,240
we just got we just sort of uh analyzed

36
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,640
i guess the security aspect of

37
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,119
agriculture and quite it uh had pretty

38
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,520
big effect if you haven't seen the fbi

39
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,200
report this week

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,280
or last week about the

41
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,840
threat of ransomware

42
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,960
um

43
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,600

couple of countries sorry companies and

45
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,000
and yeah pretty much just

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,280
you know that wasn't the idea at the

47
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,119
start but it actually

48
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,880
took off more than we could probably

49
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,079
expect

50
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,040
and um with me today we've got kelly

51
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,880

yeah i'm uh

70
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,200
editor-in-chief at the security ledger

71
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,680
cyber security news publication and also

72
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,640
founder of a

73
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,560
advocacy group called secure repairs

74
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,879
that is a group of information

75
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,239
technology information security

76
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,160
professionals who are who support the

77
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,920
right to repair we don't want 200 of

78
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,200
those

79
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,359
so

80
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,800
ran into sick codes via reddit thread i

81
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,280
don't know how long ago was man

82
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,560
a while ago

83
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,720
talking about almost a year ago almost a

84
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,080
year ago i think more than a year ago

85
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,159
talking about tcl vulnerabilities

86
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,000
remotely exploitable vulnerabilities tcl

87
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,440
smart tvs and our relationship blossomed

88
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,239
after that and been really interested to

89
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,720
follow his work

90
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,040
pen testing red teaming

91
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,400
some connected precision ag

92
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,280
equipment software and services and i

93
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,840
think this is a

94
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,480
new frontier in um the information

95
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,959
security critical infrastructure

96
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,720
uh space i've been writing about cyber

97
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,319
security for like 20 years and i think

98
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,799
this is a big new area and we're going

99
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,319
to see and hear a lot more about it

100
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,120
awesome yeah i agree with it do you want

101
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,760
to

102
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,599
so me and weber fed actually met halfway

103
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,599
through and has anyone not seen the talk

104
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,680
the one that was presented at default or

105
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,239
bits of it

106
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,440
we can actually see it so just like you

107
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,440
can hear me if you haven't yeah yeah we

108
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,959
should ask if people have not seen the

109
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,239
talk if you wanted to go over a bit of

110
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,799
it do you want to you know what i mean

111
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,560
oh you feel free to go over man

112
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,480
what do you want to go over

113
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,480
uh i was just going to go over i was

114
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,760
just going to screen share maybe like

115
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,519
the last 10 slides unless paul wants to

116
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,959
jump straight into some questions or

117
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,319
something

118
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,480
yeah man i think yeah give them kind of

119
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,959
the spark notes version of the defcon

120
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,640
presentation and then we can probably go

121
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,640
into a discussion from there yeah yeah

122
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,399
let me get on sick i'm not used to

123
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,839
presenting the public like this

124
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,720

we

136
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,639
basically found bugs around the same

137
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,000
time and just

138
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,280

172
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,319
through some slides and um if everyone's

173
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,440
i'm just going to run through some of

174
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,280
the slides and then bring in some of the

175
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,720
researchers as they come along with the

176
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,039
story so what go i won't go too

177
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,440
slow because i think some of the i mean

178
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,960
most people have actually

179
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,120
may have seen it or they already know a

180
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,520
lot about agriculture uh but if you

181
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,880
don't

182
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,720
there's a recorded video of this already

183
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,199
on youtube on the defcon site but um you

184
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,880
can hear it from the horse's mouth today

185
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,319
so this is just an old

186
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,160
very old tractor

187
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,720
and going to a new tractor

188
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,560
that's a forage harvester

189
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,080
and the reason i really like this one is

190
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,880
because it's got chainsaws on the front

191
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,440
um none of the research was paid for all

192
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,759
that's our good faith and um

193
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,800
yeah everything belongs to the

194
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,919
respective owners and i know there's

195
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,120
some owners in the audience of the

196
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,479
brands

197
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,639
um we'll get to that in a bit

198
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,680
but myself sick codes and there's all my

199
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,840
social profiles

200
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,599
um

201
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,800
basically we're just sort of

202
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,199
exaggerating the farming industry in

203
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,520
illinois and around

204
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,520
iowa as well obviously in the midwest

205
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,960
and like everything is a farm

206
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,639
just some of the dangers that we can

207
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,440
have

208
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,879
sprayers

209
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,879
denial of service which is massively

210
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,759
important but it's possibly overlooked

211
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,599
malicious firmware

212
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,919
um

213
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,280
that's it that was proven to be

214
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,479
ridiculous

215
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,319
it's almost proven to be ridiculous too

216
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,599
but spraying um let me just skip through

217
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,319
willie cade yeah he was involved the

218
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,639
grandfather sorry grandson

219
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,280
theo brown

220
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,520
kevin kenny from nebraska farmer

221
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,199
engineer

222
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,120
and the hackers

223
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,319
who have just introduced themselves i

224
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,919
think it's everyone except regex is

225
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,440
missing

226
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,799
and john jackson i don't know why they

227
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,719
didn't come and chief cooler but he's

228
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,799
i'm right here live

229
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,000
who's that

230
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,240
john jackson right here oh you just

231
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,958
joined mr hacking himself

232
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,320
he just joined

233
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,959
okay so i'll start i'll go i'll go from

234
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,800
let's go through to like something

235
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,320
interesting where is it sf1 sf2 price of

236
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,200
corn

237
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,800
trade secrets um biofuel and we start to

238
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,160
the actual hacks

239
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,200
who wants to start on the hacks

240
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,560
okay who wants to start from here

241
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,079
someone want to start web effect

242
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,240
do you want to say some stuff what do

243
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,640
you want me to present down first

244
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,120
yeah you want to do the website

245
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,640
yeah i think we just go through here so

246
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,320
this is just i said we were laughing at

247
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,279
oh

248
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,240
i guess before that um uh sick do you do

249
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,040
you want to just i mean um talk about

250
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,720
like so we've got the equipment in the

251
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,200
field and then we've got these

252
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,120
the software and services that is

253
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,800
allowing farmers and dealers to kind of

254
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,320
manage that equipment remotely um yeah

255
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
and and also the data it collects and

256
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,360
and i guess

257
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,440
one thing to point out is obviously your

258
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,519
work was focused on those soft those

259
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,640
services not on the hardware itself

260
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,720
problem is yeah with with the some of

261
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,880
the platforms they have so much um

262
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,880
integration with the software that you

263
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,320
can control the

264
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,600
stuff

265
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,839
remotely so you'll see in a minute in

266
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,839
the auto track guidance

267
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,600
which is um i don't know the different

268
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,120
auto tracking auto

269
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,640
auto trap robe but it sounds like it's

270
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,240
something to do with rose

271
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,399
auto fill

272
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,050
and then um

273
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,160
[Music]

274
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,839
but yes some of this stuff's fully room

275
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,880
about the control then i think the

276
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,880
vendors that we dealt with at this at

277
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,000
this point

278
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,440
case and

279
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,880
the uh i don't really want to name

280
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,079
anyone today

281
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,560
but um

282
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,640
yeah the two vendors uh both have remote

283
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,320
access but so the other ones i'm pretty

284
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,360
sure um you know class

285
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,839
case

286
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,320
adco trimble obviously

287
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,240
um trimble i hear some of the other

288
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,440
stuff the

289
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,120
that's sort of that's just mapping and

290
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,120
data

291
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,519
and that's the remote access style

292
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,200
accessing that's the thumbnail of the

293
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,480
video as well which is quite interesting

294
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,160
i don't know why that one came up but

295
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,600
everyone thinks that's me which is not

296
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,959
me so that's your dear technician

297
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,160
here we go connected support

298
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,519
that's it remote access

299
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,279
that's jd link i didn't know there was a

300
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,240
dashboard for jd link but i do now

301
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,959
so

302
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,200
maybe maybe have each of maybe each of

303
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,640
you maybe go through and talk a little

304
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,480
bit about your

305
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,640
what what piece of the puzzle you you

306
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,800
looked at or worked on uh as part of

307
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,600
this overall project um

308
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,640
to look at if you want yeah yeah yeah

309
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,560
so they'll pop up in a sec i mean this

310
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,880
is this is the first vulnerability

311
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,200
um this is about

312
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,480
leaking data out of the api which is now

313
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,760
patched obviously got patched pretty

314
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,570
quickly

315
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,720
[Music]

316
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,680
and that was some news about it which

317
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,319
blew up a bit

318
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,560
that's correct it wasn't all tractors it

319
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,320
was only some tractors which were the

320
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,160
ones that were connected to

321
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,719
the newer

322
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,480
the newer systems like the newer ones

323
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,000
like the older tractors obviously that

324
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,600
are they don't have any connection to

325
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,279
the internets they wouldn't be

326
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,040
i'm talking about the oldest detractors

327
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,920
but they wouldn't be connected to

328
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,440
internet at all and therefore would not

329
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,760
actually be under that umbrella and

330
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,200
that's how i met webafet who actually

331
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,480
just came through

332
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,560
he wants to jump in now if he wants and

333
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,720
yeah tell him how we work

334
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,519
okay well what happened was that

335
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,440
yeah i was trolling twitter one day like

336
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,399
i usually do looking for my next thing

337
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,639
which because i'm a good guy would just

338
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,120
basically mean a company bragging or

339
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,639
boasting that maybe they don't have any

340
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,040
security vulnerabilities and i can maybe

341
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,560
get a bounty out of it

342
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,480
so i happen to see that

343
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,760
john deere had said that they didn't

344
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,519
have any vulnerabilities

345
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,120
and then somehow sit codes came into

346
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,920
play

347
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,000
so i messaged him on twitter told him

348
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,600
what i had found which was basically

349
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,000
like xss injections and stuff like that

350
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,880
and

351
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,279
with the centers that they have between

352
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,680
their hardware and software layers

353
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,440
and basically we started with domain

354
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,360
enumeration footprinting all their

355
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,800
assets

356
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,600
then as six says we found love

357
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,360
we basically

358
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,760
branched out with john jay hacking higg

359
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,279
all these guys

360
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,959
and it just became something bigger than

361
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,839
we thought it was gonna be

362
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,839
and i basically handed all the stuff off

363
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,000
do you remember saying this

364
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,600
yeah of course i do

365
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,440
i mean the one on the screen it says i'm

366
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,519
getting uh at the end of the day i'd

367
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,600
rather do it for free than than lose

368
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,800
food because we were doing the bug

369
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,880
bounty stuff for free

370
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,040
this just captured the moment between me

371
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,839
and wabafet at the start

372
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,160
this was a long time ago this is before

373
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,079
this is literally just after one of the

374
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,040
vendors got their vdp

375
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,440
in place which is the first vendor

376
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,959
in the agriculture industry to actually

377
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,040
have a proper bdp which is

378
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,440
something to be proud of to be fair

379
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,600
um there's actually none other than that

380
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,040
at the moment except i think bayer

381
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,240
produced one i think a couple of days

382
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,120
ago

383
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,199
it's a vulnerability disclosure policy

384
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,839
pdp that's correct yeah yeah so d is

385
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,440
actually the only one so if you're

386
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,279
actually at another company or another

387
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,720
type of um

388
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,000
industrial

389
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,240
control related

390
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,399
i don't know system then then yeah who

391
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,839
else is uh

392
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:04,959
oh yeah

393
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,639
did you want to i'd like to think about

394
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:07,839
that

395
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,279
i'd like to think that we were directly

396
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,920
responsible for dear and bayer's

397
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,639
responsible disclosure programs

398
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,920
well we just kick-started it that's

399
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,519
right yeah yeah you know what i mean we

400
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,120
gave them the incentives you know what i

401
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,120
mean

402
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,279
yeah fast-tracking i'd probably say fast

403
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,040
like i said at the time

404
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,800
or recently i've been saying like

405
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,480
they're not thanking us yet but they'll

406
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,000
probably thank us in a few months when

407
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,519
they realize like if you have a look at

408
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,440
this message which this encapsulates

409
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,959
everything they've got they've even said

410
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,920
we have good faith and safe harbor

411
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,000
in the this was this was

412
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,920
the first email that i sent and while

413
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,079
i've had this is your email by the way

414
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,680
oh this is your email as well

415
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,160
yeah this is the first message that we

416
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,880
had with dr and they actually

417
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,320
before this they were asking to send

418
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,800
through to the secure social media team

419
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,000
and that's obviously changed and now

420
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,279
it's like a proper

421
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,600
hacker one program you know what i mean

422
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,800
yeah

423
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
so sick maybe talk

424
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,399
what give it give an overview of the

425
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,959
vulnerabilities that you discovered in

426
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,320
the deer

427
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,560
platform you mentioned

428
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,000
um

429
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,360
uh there were some information

430
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,240
disclosure vulnerabilities um

431
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,079
was there was there stuff that was

432
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,320
remotely exploitable like what what

433
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,320
types of flaws when you when you started

434
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,760
poking around in these jd connect and jd

435
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,920
link and these other services what types

436
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,680
of stuff did you find

437
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,839
you and the whole team obviously yeah

438
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,839
this is the xss but whoever found it

439
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,519
first i mean i think i think everyone

440
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,680
eventually found this one it was like

441
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,079
it was it was so easy to exploit but i

442
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,360
think it was boba fett this is the one

443
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,720
that weber fed produced wasn't it

444
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,079
yeah i think so one of there's like five

445
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,240
of them i think me and it's on the

446
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,560
of them and excuse my language what are

447
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,160
we looking at here guys what is this

448
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,160
okay this is a cross-site scripting

449
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,839
attack

450
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,360
what's the feature of the website that

451
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,079
you found it on

452
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,959
it was on the purchase order the dealer

453
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,279
supplier portal or page which is now

454
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,759
private anyway

455
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,519
but if someone wants to explain how and

456
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,519
why an exercise is terribly bad that

457
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,360
would be right yeah

458
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,320
go ahead

459
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,320
oh okay

460
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,320
yeah so so basically what you're looking

461
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,160
at here is reflected cross-site

462
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,320
scripting uh reflected cross-site

463
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,320
scripting is something that where

464
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,880
basically a threat actor can take a

465
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,079
payload that is appended to the end of a

466
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,480
url within the parameter and basically

467
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,120
how it works is they can take that url

468
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,120
and they can send it to someone and

469
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,199
trick them into thinking that they're

470
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,839
logging into the website or using

471
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,079
a part or component of the web

472
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,279
application

473
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,680
and then they can basically

474
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,120
steal their cookies

475
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,000
or

476
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,240
fish them and steal their credentials or

477
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,839
potentially take over their their

478
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,199
browser

479
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,320
and this is

480
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,959
pretty problematic especially because

481
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,880
the cross-site scripting vulnerabilities

482
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,640
were found in a bunch of stuff including

483
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,799
you know that dealer login portal

484
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,559
so it would be pretty

485
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,079
easy to start doing actions on behalf of

486
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,520
other users

487
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,679
once you just social engineer and just

488
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,559
kind of pre-text and context uh exploit

489
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,039
so reflected cross-site scripting uh

490
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,720
starts out a little small and then can

491
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,319
end up critical depending on what you

492
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,720
could acquire

493
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,799
that's it man and i think that was also

494
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,559
we found more in this one here which was

495
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,760
quite funny

496
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,760
this one we should have exploited

497
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,799
um

498
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,039
to an extent like that we didn't really

499
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,960
we touched on it it was this is the ibm

500
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,080
db2

501
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,080
i think a bunch of us found this i was

502
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,000
actively trying to write queries to it

503
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,760
but i don't really know how to do ibm

504
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,320
db2 stuff i think he

505
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,080
i think higgins weber fed had also seen

506
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,360
this one

507
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,039
if i remember correctly there was sql

508
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,520
injection on this too yeah yeah this is

509
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,160
the sequence yeah

510
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,720
what data did that so sql injection so

511
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,520
you're you're using sql queries kind of

512
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,559
malformed to basically send commands and

513
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,919
other things to the to the backend

514
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,760
database what types of data what types

515
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,440
of information was that giving you

516
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,840
access to

517
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,280
yeah we can see what this is probably

518
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,880
going to produce if it was fully

519
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,400
exploitable but

520
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,080
this produced the invoice number zero

521
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,760
one zero six with the supplier

522
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,720
number of star uh or pound uh if you

523
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,919
guys called that and then the email

524
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,840
address a while just random

525
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,880
yeah wild card stuff this is just like

526
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,240
yeah so that's a vulnerability in itself

527
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,480
yeah yeah i mean just being able to see

528
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,320
that just being able to see that that's

529
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,480
like giving me all records

530
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,320
astro star john d or anything with that

531
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,440
extension

532
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,280
yeah it didn't do anything but what it

533
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,120
did do is produce this little this

534
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,080
little error message and um i could i

535
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,760
just kept injecting stuff into this

536
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,320
query i had no idea how to use ibm db2

537
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,760
that's the thing like

538
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,440
if somebody knows that like

539
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,640
you can see it's actually putting the

540
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,679
query

541
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,200
i was writing these queries by the way i

542
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,760
was writing those queries at the bottom

543
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,320
and like a nested injection

544
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,120
yeah

545
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,480
so so

546
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,000
one thing to keep in mind is like you

547
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,520
guys do this for a living so you're

548
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,039
looking at

549
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,520
web applications all the time when you

550
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,120
find like

551
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,000
verbose error messages like this or

552
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,720
account enumeration like

553
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,640
what in your mind like what are you

554
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,200
thinking and what is that saying about

555
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,600
the overall integrity of the application

556
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,280
itself

557
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,799
kelly

558
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,960
so they're not sanitizing user inputs

559
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,360
right and they're also not saying like

560
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,240
okay

561
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,280
this is information that

562
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,760
we shouldn't show to anyone who uses

563
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,799
this application this is debug related

564
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,559
information this is not something that

565
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,960
should be available if you you know

566
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,600
enter a query and uh you you're looking

567
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,760
for all the all the email addresses or

568
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,960
all the purchase order numbers or

569
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,159
something like that you shouldn't be

570
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,200
able to

571
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,480
uh get back what the bad query was

572
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,080
yeah and you shouldn't so this is also

573
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,080
injecting like i was putting

574
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,520
i think i was putting i actually wrote

575
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,880
all that query like

576
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,559
that was actually the union stuff was

577
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,159
all me i actually don't know how to do

578
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,280
it so that means you can fully inject it

579
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,320
and you're right it shouldn't be

580
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,679
available

581
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,600
it isn't available anymore but there's

582
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,880
there's no reason to say that why you

583
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,240
couldn't be getting it from behind the

584
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,000
firewall so say for example you're

585
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,400
already logged in or you are a dealer in

586
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,080
the network and you would be able to use

587
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,480
that page you could still possibly

588
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,760
exploit that page if it hasn't been

589
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,520
fixed on the inside and that's important

590
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,039
to if someone wants to talk about the

591
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,159
importance of

592
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,400
testing on the inside or like um

593
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,919
you know behind the wave

594
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,640
if i if i may we talked a lot and

595
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,240
about like all these exploits um and i'm

596
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,039
i'm kind of wondering if uh we shouldn't

597
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,240
back up and

598
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,960
kind of explain the workflow that that

599
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,120
we were going through right like how

600
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,400
many domains how many domains did we get

601
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,679
and uh

602
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,039
i mean

603
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,280
from from the get-go we ended up with a

604
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,559
giant stash of um information right so

605
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,240
when the one things that most companies

606
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,320
don't do is control their information

607
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,600
leakage

608
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,400
so we had all these dns entries that we

609
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,240
were able to then go and scan with our

610
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,400
vulnerability scanners

611
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,200
personally play with um you know inject

612
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,640
code into

613
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,720
um and and you're right we do this

614
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,240
pretty regularly i mean there's not a

615
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,799
time when one of us isn't online hacking

616
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:39,840
something

617
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,240
uh but but

618
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,039
yeah

619
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,480
but from an over

620
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,320
an overview from the user think about

621
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,919
every time you entered

622
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,559
uh your tractor's vin number or

623
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,039
you have an account at uh jed and you're

624
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,440
like man i need to get uh i wanna try

625
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,600
the new model or i wanna order this

626
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,000
piece or i need to upgrade some firmware

627
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,960
anytime you put your normal information

628
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,559
in there in any one of those spots that

629
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,600
you would generally do your daily work

630
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,120
we go in and we kind of do a level of

631
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,320
chaos engineering we put in us known

632
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,120
payloads and stuff to us things that we

633
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,679
would expect the user not to do and not

634
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,440
to expect and that kind of causes the

635
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,679
applications to give us errors

636
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,600
and we just got really good at reading

637
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,799
these errors

638
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,320
and that's

639
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,840
kind of like those clues

640
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,039
exactly

641
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,000
yeah

642
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,240
and so that's how that's how the hacking

643
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,799
uh especially of of john deere right

644
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:37,919
because we were

645
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,280
when we were going through here and

646
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,480
finding these applications it was like

647
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,640
man what even is this app

648
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,480
okay let's go try and do things and then

649
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,960
you know and there's five or six of us

650
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,880
constantly on

651
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,000
one of

652
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,679
hundreds if not thousands of endpoints

653
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,760
we had for

654
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,200
think one of the main things is we has

655
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,039
we had the axiom i haven't got it in the

656
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,120
slides for some reason but i do have it

657
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,520
in the picture we had the axiom server

658
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,919
which produced a list of actually

659
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,600
endpoints which was

660
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,440
made it really easy uh that shouldn't

661
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,960
have been available but

662
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,159
remember that do you guys remember the

663
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,360
axiom i don't know if i put it in the

664
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,200
slides but um it

665
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,880
literally let us

666
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,440
see exactly what services were online

667
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,520
what's crashing all the time

668
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,760
what um yeah and then and then we pulled

669
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,840
out some next points later but we'll get

670
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,120
let me get to the next one this is

671
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,600
another xss dom base which you'll see

672
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,280
right here do you want to talk about

673
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,440
this is a web effects computer so you

674
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,280
want to chat about that one man

675
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,840
um yeah well basically it's basically a

676
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,520
regurgitation of what john said because

677
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,120
you can't really explain it any better

678
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,440
than the impact of that or even what

679
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,679
kelly said about the non-sanitation user

680
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,559
input it basically leads down to which

681
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,559
one of us in the group

682
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,840
is like quick trigger that's gonna find

683
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,799
the

684
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,400
bug before the other one does because

685
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,159
it's inevitable especially with john

686
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,039
deere software at this level it was

687
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,679
swiss cheese to say the least

688
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,679
and i think it's certainly because out

689
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,080
of field day

690
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,200
i was just going to say it's only

691
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,120
because no one had ever looked at it i

692
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,039
mean yeah

693
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,640
i'm just having some good fun with them

694
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,000
making sure everything is safe for their

695
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
users

696
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,760
yeah if someone's a chat so who wants to

697
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,760
explain the dom-based xss attack here

698
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,360
it's like it's actually you can actually

699
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,440
write onto you can write extra html onto

700
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,840
the page

701
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,159
yeah i love john john explain this one

702
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,600
because he does uh

703
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,000
sure so so where this gets interesting

704
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,200
is so

705
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,880
you see that it's actually written so

706
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,640
it's getting it's getting like stored

707
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,120
there um and what you can actually end

708
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,240
up doing

709
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,440
is

710
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,440
so the the dom is breaking typically if

711
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,520
it's dom cross-site scripting it's going

712
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,760
to be a lot like reflected cross-site

713
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,120
scripting in the sense of you're going

714
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,720
to give someone um a payload via url and

715
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,000
you're basically going to do what i was

716
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,480
talking about about before which is

717
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,440
social engineer or or trick someone

718
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,559
into

719
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,080
clicking that link um in some instances

720
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,000
when you see something like that if it's

721
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,679
persistent so if you see those

722
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,600
characters persistently there even after

723
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,360
you refresh the page then you've got an

724
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,360
instance of story cross-site scripting

725
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,679
and that's uh complex because you don't

726
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,600
have to social engineer someone you can

727
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,440
store it and when they go to do

728
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,760
something like reserve their equipment

729
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,360
like you see in this instance then you

730
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,799
could end up with

731
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,960
a pop-up and then they think that they

732
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,480
need to do something

733
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,400
um and then they like put in their

734
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,400
credentials or or get phished or

735
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,720
redirected to another website without

736
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,960
you having to trick them so

737
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,679
those are the two aspects there

738
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,279
that's it man i just want to touch on a

739
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,640
few things if there's anyone here who

740
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,240
actually works at the i know there is i

741
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,240
just want to say sorry for any sleepless

742
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,520
nights because

743
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,400
we obviously didn't actively

744
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,640
attack deer uh even though the maybe the

745
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,480
media makes it sound like that or

746
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,640
uh you know what i mean but we didn't

747
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,520
actually attack them on purpose we just

748
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,279
were looking at

749
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,880
targets which were

750
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,480
exciting i guess if that's if that makes

751
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,679
sense like something that's exciting

752
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,240
yeah out of curiosity and we actually

753
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,559
meant zero harm and like i said it's

754
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,159
better than us to go in there than it is

755
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,600
to have

756
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,480
you know

757
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,559
the other type of event that happens the

758
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,320
bad things

759
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,960
and it happens

760
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,880
yeah we just want people to know that we

761
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,360
don't mean anybody any harm we all we do

762
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,720
this just to make sure that their

763
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,200
customers are safe

764
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,640
um

765
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,080
you said um in in interviews

766
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,520
one of the things you sort of said we

767
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,279
got the keys to the kingdom can you talk

768
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,360
about that particular

769
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,159
part of the um pen test that you guys

770
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,559
did and and what you were what when when

771
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,760
you said we had the keys to the kingdom

772
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,919
kind of what what level of what access

773
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,880
you had and how did you obtain it

774
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,960
well yeah that one comes up in a bit uh

775
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,400
in a probably about a minute yeah

776
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,240
because we're starting i just um in the

777
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,440
slides i think the other guys have seen

778
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,840
this on but the the machine book and

779
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,240
that lettuce so this is i'll touch on

780
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,279
this because i mentioned it on the

781
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,159
malwarebytes podcast but if you have

782
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,080
all of these email addresses all of

783
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,960
these times of equipment of bookings of

784
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,679
the demo units i believe

785
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,200
and i'm just speculating from like

786
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,960
watching youtube videos and seeing

787
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,880
seeing agricultural equipment get rented

788
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,559
out for

789
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,000
yeah i don't know just i just seen

790
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,080
another youtube video specifically um

791
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,679
the farmer forgot his name

792
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,120
millennial pharma i think a lot of

793
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,480
people have seen that youtube channel

794
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,840
and i literally just got introduced to

795
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,320
it during this session but seeing that

796
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,760
and then seeing like oh i've got the

797
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,279
tractor on wednesday and then seeing

798
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,679
this book this website and i'm like oh

799
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,360
that's that's what this is this is the

800
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,200
booking unit thing for that i didn't

801
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,880
look any one of names up but i'm just

802
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,120
saying like some of the names in the at

803
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,440
deer email addresses or the vendor email

804
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,640
addresses

805
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,159
they

806
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,919
resolved to pretty high up people in the

807
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,159
organization and if you were

808
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,840
cunning enough or

809
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,039
and that's how a lot of a lot of

810
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,480
ransomware is happening these days is

811
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,960
through fishing spearfishing or targeted

812
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,799
attacks and if you actually know

813
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,760
that many like specifics about an event

814
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,840
you know like hey it's terry from from

815
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,960
from admin

816
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,320
i'm booking the tractor on wednesday can

817
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,080
you change it to when tuesday here's the

818
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,240
link and then you put the xss and the

819
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,320
xss takes you to a form which is like a

820
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,760
different website

821
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,360
you can ruin the whole organization in

822
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,840
one click that's how you pair the xss

823
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,360
with something this serious like a

824
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,320
database dump you know you can actually

825
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,919
pair them up and then get full access

826
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,200
which we did later on but we'll get in

827
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,880
there

828
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,880
that's right it's not it's not just what

829
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,399
you can do immediately it's also how the

830
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,039
information you obtain can set you up to

831
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,320
do follow-on attacks or compromises via

832
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,559
phishing or whatever that's why

833
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,480
for you know sophisticated attackers

834
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,960
russian you know nation state actors you

835
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,120
know exchange servers email servers

836
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,960
often one of the top targets along with

837
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,559
the domain controller because they can

838
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,600
get access to all that email content all

839
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,559
that context that they can then use to

840
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,399
social engineer fish

841
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,600
people

842
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,440
at their choosing right not right away

843
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,559
maybe six months you know

844
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,000
yeah that's true the timing part of it i

845
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,440
never thought about

846
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,760
um you could store that information and

847
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,279
there's a lot of insider stuff happening

848
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,320
these days

849
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,240
i think um kelly what have you heard

850
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,559
from your organization about insider

851
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,960
threats

852
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,279
so i think in general insider threats

853
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,919
are definitely a category of thing that

854
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,360
we worry about

855
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,640
um just because you know if you have

856
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,000
that you know at

857
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,960
organization.whatever.com email address

858
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,120
you have access to so much more than you

859
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,120
do just as a customer

860
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,240
or as a you know as a user of web

861
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,360
systems

862
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,520
so if i have something like a whole

863
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,960
database full of email addresses of like

864
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,360
deer.com and i have something on the

865
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,679
other hand like uh you know direct

866
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,360
access to their email portal like paul

867
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,399
was saying

868
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,120
um or you know any anywhere with a login

869
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,399
page i can just sit there with their

870
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,080
email addresses and start brute forcing

871
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,760
their passwords right

872
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,279
yeah that's right and there was no there

873
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,120
was no brute force control on some of

874
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,960
the parts i remember at the api at the

875
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,200
beginning there was no like i sent i

876
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,520
sent requests on unauthenticated without

877
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,760
cookies for username lookups

878
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,039
they fix that really quickly so

879
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,039
congratulations to dear for fixing that

880
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,399
one and all of the ones actually they

881
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,640
fixed really quickly

882
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,919
uh just took a while there's just a

883
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,240
miscommunication problem and i think i

884
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,679
think casey will get into that later on

885
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,159
casey's also speaking um but just to

886
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:37,600
miscommunicate it's happening a lot

887
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,200
lately as well even with that within the

888
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,880
bug bounty community

889
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,919
the the communication is

890
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,600
is lackluster

891
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,120
what do you what who wants to discuss

892
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,159
some of the stuff that's going on at the

893
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,240
moment i mean outside of outside of deer

894
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,320
but just the fact you know like the the

895
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,840
the existing bug bounty issue about like

896
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,679
pricing and and

897
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:58,880
doing it for free and then getting

898
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,159
treated like you know i mean yeah

899
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,480
go for it i mean i i wrote a book on it

900
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,360
so

901
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,799
um

902
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,200
one of the things i want to say is uh i

903
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,480
think a lot of people get confused

904
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,960
between vdp's vulnerability disclosure

905
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,000
programs and bbps bug bounty programs um

906
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,600
but the easiest way to tell the

907
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,679
difference is vdps don't pay money and

908
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,080
bug bounty programs well it's a bounty

909
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,679
so you're getting paid money for finding

910
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,960
vulnerabilities um the problem that that

911
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,120
a lot of the people in the industry are

912
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,480
having with this

913
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,039
is they're setting up bug bounty

914
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,279
programs and they're unprepared they

915
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,600
don't have sick uh security staff or

916
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,679
they're not getting set up with the with

917
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,480
the right staff um to

918
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,039
basically just get everything set up um

919
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,440
and what ends up happening is

920
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,200
they underprice vulnerabilities or

921
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,080
um

922
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,480
they don't get to resolving the

923
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,440
vulnerability reports quickly and it's

924
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,840
really um it's bad it's really bad

925
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,159
so uh for instance in in john deere's

926
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,240
case they set up this bug bounty program

927
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,159
and if if you're listening you know not

928
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,080
trying to rip on you so much so is it

929
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,559
it's all just new to everyone um but

930
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:11,840
basically

931
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,600
you know they weren't paying for any of

932
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,679
the vulnerabilities um and that's

933
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,600
problematic because when you invite

934
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,279
researchers into private programs and

935
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,120
they think they're gonna get paid and

936
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,840
then everything's um out of scope for

937
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,120
payment

938
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,279
it gets really complex because you know

939
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,159
it's it's free work and you're not

940
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,559
getting paid money um in some senses

941
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,000
that's okay but

942
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
that kind of needs to be relayed

943
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,480
beforehand so uh researchers don't end

944
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,440
up joining programs and

945
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,480
uh being forced or uh to

946
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,320
uh or binded to

947
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,080
non-disclosure agreements

948
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,240
uh i think the guy's here but that's i

949
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,919
mean the guy that actually um that i was

950
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,679
chatting to during that i mean like i

951
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,360
said it was a learning experience and i

952
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,360
don't want to rip on it yeah and he's a

953
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,240
good guy no no of course yeah yeah yeah

954
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,080
a lot has changed since then yeah it's

955
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,640
not like it's not like that i think

956
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,760
yeah

957
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,960
i'm just trying to put the positive lot

958
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,559
enough yeah

959
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,820
it's not like

960
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,240
[Music]

961
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,600
i think what you're saying is because

962
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,440
there's maturity there's a maturity

963
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,120
curve i guess for these and just like

964
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,279
you wouldn't yes you wouldn't open a

965
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,799
store without

966
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,960
without thinking through like how am i

967
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,799
going to manage transactions what am i

968
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,399
selling how much am i you know going to

969
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,480
charge for them like what's my overhead

970
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,080
kind of the same thing with the bug

971
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,440
bounty program you don't just throw the

972
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,360
doors open and invite the public in and

973
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,880
then figure out the stuff on the back

974
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,159
end

975
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:37,120
yeah really

976
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,880
private they didn't start private but

977
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,159
they didn't put

978
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,679
bounties on it and they still aren't and

979
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,200
i highly recommend that the bender put

980
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,120
boundaries on their program or any

981
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,720
vendor or all vendors put bounties in

982
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,240
their programs because it's it's kind of

983
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,039
like

984
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,640
it's kind of offensive to invite

985
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,640
researchers to programs which you may

986
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,679
not be aware of but it's kind of

987
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,200
offensive it's kind of like rude to buy

988
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,960
someone privately especially

989
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,480
as john was saying to a program and then

990
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,279
not get paid for it

991
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,880
you know what i have to say to that sec

992
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,919
kelly

993
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,679
think about what the consulting rates

994
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,039
would be think about what our

995
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,960
consumption would be if you were to hire

996
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,480
us

997
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,639
you know right like we're doing work

998
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,079
that we would do

999
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,639
if we were doing it to be paid for you

1000
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,480
know like that's it's it's you know

1001
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,119
right and kelly brings up a good point i

1002
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,040
mean like the consulting rates you're

1003
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,599
looking at uh a a one-week long

1004
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,599
engagement two week long engagement can

1005
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:34,000
end up costing a company a smaller

1006
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,079
company twenty thirty thousand dollars

1007
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,599
if they're a bigger company you know you

1008
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,199
can look at upwards of

1009
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,359
fifty to a hundred thousand dollars so

1010
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,280
you know it's it's not a matter of oh

1011
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,359
you need to pay us it's a matter of uh

1012
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,520
well you know if you're having people

1013
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,280
help you find vulnerabilities for you to

1014
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,800
patch so you don't get exploited and

1015
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,320
ransomware and all that kind of stuff

1016
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,399
then then what you should probably do is

1017
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:55,280
just

1018
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,480
you know pay them as a as a courtesy um

1019
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,480
invest especially if it's private too

1020
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,040
yeah it is an investment so it's and

1021
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,359
it's worthwhile and it always has been

1022
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,839
yeah man do you want to discuss your

1023
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,280
seat i mean we've only got like 15

1024
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,200
minutes and we can also if anyone wants

1025
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,280
to reach out to us after you can send us

1026
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,880
emails

1027
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,680
that

1028
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,440
i'll try and i mean you can send us the

1029
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,200
emails on the slides or intro like sick

1030
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,800
dot codes or in the discord i think at

1031
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,119
the corncon discord just feel free to

1032
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,400
like

1033
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,079
yeah

1034
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,880
questions

1035
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,160
and also like maybe talk about the

1036
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,560
broader context which is bug bounty

1037
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,200
programs aren't new um

1038
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,720
zero day initiative was more than a

1039
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,000
decade ago

1040
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,200
um well

1041
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,240
more than 15 years ago um and yet in the

1042
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,680
agriculture sector i think one of the

1043
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,599
things your research point out is that

1044
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,280
these are new things these are new

1045
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,760
developments

1046
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,119
who's got questions because i know there

1047
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,240
was definitely some questions

1048
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,480
this um

1049
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,320
or does anyone want to introduce

1050
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,000
themselves

1051
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
i think we have some people in the

1052
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,520
audience who are

1053
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,160
not going to answer ask questions

1054
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,839
fair

1055
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,119
enough that's alright thank you for

1056
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,200
joining and listening to us anyways for

1057
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,440
those of you who have

1058
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,000
visited all that

1059
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,040
equipment

1060
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,680
in

1061
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,280
acting and

1062
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,760
vulnerabilities or mug

1063
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,359
um just let me know i've got the

1064
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,359
microphone here you guys

1065
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,240
want to uh talk about what brownies and

1066
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,520
the beer picture i think you said

1067
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,280
yeah i mean i could i could touch on

1068
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,440
that a little bit if you guys just he's

1069
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,960
talking about the audience i think okay

1070
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,359
is that right

1071
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,480
[Music]

1072
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,079
oh okay right

1073
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,839
yeah let's do that he wrote the book on

1074
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:50,720
it

1075
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,320
yeah but just just quickly i want to

1076
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,079
mention if anyone does want to reach out

1077
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,359
and they don't want to be like on tape

1078
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:56,320
or anything

1079
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,160
just email one of us you can google any

1080
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,359
of us probably stick codes i'll just

1081
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:00,800
send it to whoever it is if it doesn't

1082
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,720
if you haven't got their email

1083
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,920
but if you want to ask something

1084
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,200
specifically then definitely reach out

1085
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,560
but yeah go for it john and then talk

1086
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,760
about your cbe

1087
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,280
your big one

1088
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,119
sure yeah so i was going to say that the

1089
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,640
bigger picture here

1090
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,599
is

1091
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,560
to protect the agricultural industry

1092
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,320
because if you think about it it's a

1093
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,680
critical industry right we're talking

1094
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,560
about food what happens if a nation

1095
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,880
state threat actor manages to get

1096
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,480
control of

1097
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,200
uh equipment like tractors or

1098
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,560
something like that and end up

1099
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,920
destroying

1100
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,720
uh crops right destroying the food so

1101
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,440
it's a food supply chain attack um and

1102
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,079
this is this is a serious issue because

1103
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,400
nation state threat actors are are kind

1104
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,760
of ramping up

1105
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,920
in what they do and who they target and

1106
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,160
they're going um after critical

1107
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,920
infrastructure as a lot of you have

1108
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,760
probably heard about with the uh

1109
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,200
pipeline attack

1110
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,880
um where they drop their daughter as

1111
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,920
well yeah yeah data too i mean data

1112
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,000
data's always uh people are always after

1113
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,079
data but i think the bigger picture here

1114
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,640
with agriculture is disrupting uh food

1115
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,480
supply like in uh

1116
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,560
australia where they ran somewhere that

1117
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,240
that meat uh

1118
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,720
production uh company kbs and then they

1119
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,800
actually yeah

1120
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,960
they're

1121
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,800
yeah so i mean overall it's bad because

1122
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,760
now they're having trouble or they were

1123
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,040
having trouble

1124
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,680
producing meat right and and getting

1125
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,640
meat out there and so literally it is a

1126
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,640
food supply chain attack and preventing

1127
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,040
people from distributing food so that's

1128
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,240
kind of the

1129
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,640
the mission here with with bug bounty

1130
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,280
programs and with security

1131
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,280
programs in general is you need to be

1132
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,480
able to

1133
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,560
set up comprehensive security programs

1134
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,480
to prevent

1135
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,400
uh criminals from

1136
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,160
exploitation for malicious gain whether

1137
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,480
it be money or whether it be just uh

1138
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,839
disrupting

1139
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:08,000
uh resources and and supply resources so

1140
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,680
i'll just yeah that's kind of the bigger

1141
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,280
picture there

1142
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,960
i was gonna mention like it's not like

1143
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,480
it's not like painting a house like you

1144
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,400
paint it once if you're doing security

1145
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,800
you can invite 100 types of you know

1146
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,040
people to come and paint your house and

1147
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,720
it's never going to be fully painted so

1148
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,640
like you'll never get everything and

1149
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,079
this is an analogy i brought up in my

1150
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,560
head but it's probably good to actually

1151
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,920
engage

1152
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,760
researchers over and over again because

1153
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,119
a lot of these companies that we looked

1154
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,200
at didn't did have actually security

1155
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,200
programs and did have actually people

1156
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,040
who were pen testing them or automated

1157
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,119
stuff and crappy tools

1158
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,240
not their tools i'm saying like the

1159
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,079
people that were looking at them

1160
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,839
but when somebody who were proficient

1161
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,839
who come in and just have it like a look

1162
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:49,280
but the world's best painter comes in

1163
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,800
and just starts painting and they get

1164
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,760
everything in one go and just like like

1165
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,560
in this example we were actually

1166
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,400
we can see the pega

1167
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,079
so actually i'll give this one to pega

1168
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,839
actually because pega actually calls

1169
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,599
this in a way that is a little bit

1170
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,040
different because i can see that the

1171
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,680
pega admins issue these keys

1172
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,119
and we're not going to get

1173
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,800
it's so embarrassing actually looking at

1174
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,599
these pages that we've got here because

1175
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,680
this is pega systems you're talking

1176
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,200
about

1177
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,880
yes

1178
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,240
before we get the paga it looks like

1179
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,920
someone might have a question there do

1180
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,760
you have a question yeah we do have a

1181
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,280
question uh ron

1182
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,200
uh so my question is

1183
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,560
um

1184
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,040
crosstalk you know xss and sql

1185
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,960
injections are i think you know for the

1186
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,160
ransomware

1187
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,640
pc but i haven't seen you guys anything

1188
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,960
you actually does affect the food supply

1189
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,599
from an operational standpoint i

1190
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:42,800
fire it brings the fundamental

1191
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,720
miscontractions and say if something

1192
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,960
malfunctions it's automated you can

1193
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,720
always manually override this so how do

1194
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,280
you guys find if this has an impact on

1195
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,520
actual food production other than taking

1196
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,200
people's attention from you know being

1197
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,520
out in the fields

1198
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,880
sure so yes

1199
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,000
look at jbs i mean jbs got they were

1200
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,079
socially engineered through

1201
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,960
data acquisition to for someone to

1202
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,880
install malware i guess this is a guess

1203
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,480
right this is just this is a typical

1204
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,720
typical thing but that would disrupt it

1205
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,160
and it did i mean there were literally

1206
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,000
trucks standing at the front with cows

1207
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,079
or cattle just just waiting there you

1208
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,440
know what i mean like

1209
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,760
that is a real example that is

1210
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,079
exploitable um even today we saw

1211
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,440
something like i was seeing on twitter

1212
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,160
like a qantas email addre a qantas

1213
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,640
website with an open redirect

1214
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,119
or like a and like imagine a dhl website

1215
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,560
with open redirect you could just send

1216
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,240
that to somebody at dhl and they would

1217
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,319
believe it's a dhl website and they

1218
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:39,599
would go straight through to whatever

1219
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,359
access or whatever portal you're sending

1220
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,720
like what destination you want to send

1221
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,640
them to and i think weather fits punched

1222
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,359
a hole in um open redirects before

1223
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:48,720
yeah but

1224
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,560
well i can one thing i might one one

1225
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,480
thing i might say is

1226
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,760
while these

1227
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,839
well these hackers did while these folks

1228
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:58,319
didn't show you here's me pushing

1229
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:01,200
malicious code to deployed equipment in

1230
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,599
the field they have shown you the

1231
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,000
building blocks for a successful attack

1232
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,079
that would do that they've shown you how

1233
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,000
they would go to deers in corporate

1234
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,280
infrastructure

1235
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,280
extract the information needed to do

1236
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,520
sophisticated phishing attacks they've

1237
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,359
shown you that they've been able to get

1238
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:20,400
access to and manipulate the the

1239
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,480
web-based internet based infrastructure

1240
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,440
that is used to push software updates to

1241
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,240
push uh configuration settings to

1242
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,480
monitor and extract data from deployed

1243
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,440
equipment in the field so the fact that

1244
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,440
they didn't actually connect the dots

1245
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,119
and actually show you them pushing the

1246
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,960
malicious code out to the field

1247
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,800
shouldn't give you a lot of confidence

1248
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,440
that such an attack isn't already

1249
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,400
possible

1250
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,920
in the hands of a sophisticated

1251
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,760
nation-state actor or cyber criminal

1252
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,079
actor who wants to shut down mission

1253
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,760
critical equipment during planting

1254
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,920
season during harvest season for a

1255
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,160
critical window of time and ask in

1256
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,599
essence whatever they want and you know

1257
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,640
the the the fact that that attack hasn't

1258
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,280
happened should give you zero confidence

1259
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,680
that it couldn't happen tomorrow the day

1260
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,040
after tomorrow next year whenever so

1261
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,839
cool can i touch on something here

1262
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:15,599
okay well what this is to answer that

1263
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,319
question we didn't present that because

1264
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,000
one it's not legal

1265
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,960
two it's not as ethical and three

1266
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,520
we'd go to jail the bad guys they don't

1267
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,920
care about those things

1268
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,000
so that's why they do it and we don't we

1269
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,160
can't bring it to that level because

1270
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,160
we're hoping to catch it this was all

1271
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,079
yes this has played up a little bit

1272
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,839
you know what i mean as security

1273
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:40,560
incidents always uh no we didn't do

1274
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,319
anything like he's describing and he's

1275
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,640
correct but like you said paul

1276
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,800
the fact that that hasn't happened

1277
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,119
shouldn't give pause that it's safe

1278
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,119
it could happen and and you showed the

1279
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,359
building blocks of a successful attack

1280
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:54,560
that couldn't do those things you showed

1281
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,720
up well we tried to elements needed yeah

1282
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,520
well

1283
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,720
i was in this screenshot i'll show you

1284
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,400
the screenshot this is the audit log at

1285
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,880
pega and somebody put their

1286
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,680
their password in the email address slot

1287
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,040
and we can actually see that it's

1288
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,720
redacted but we had the email we had a

1289
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,280
picker admin email user and password and

1290
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,359
they probably didn't even change it

1291
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,200
we're wearing gloves we have to wear

1292
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,200
boxing gloves and be all light about it

1293
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,480
in obey laws and cfaa this it's hard to

1294
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,560
even convince the companies there's

1295
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,160
something wrong because we can't take

1296
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,920
that extra step

1297
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,200
i just realized i wasn't sharing my

1298
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,839
screen sorry about that um

1299
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:31,440
yeah this is this is this is the pega

1300
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,000
admin page portal login i just realized

1301
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,200
no one could see any of the keys we're

1302
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,520
looking at hang on let me go back a bit

1303
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,359
yeah yeah the keys so these are the keys

1304
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:40,640
same old keys

1305
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,280
pega admin keys this could have been bad

1306
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,880
security audit logs where somebody put

1307
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,480
their password in the username slot and

1308
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,880
we can actually see it in the log

1309
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,240
so if you could log in as the pekka

1310
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,680
admin you could turn off everything you

1311
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,680
know i mean you could turn off

1312
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,119
a lot of things probably not everything

1313
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:56,640
but probably everything let me touch on

1314
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,720
this the pegas stuff

1315
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,760
so so the other thing about pega is uh

1316
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,800
so we found a cbe which is a zero-day

1317
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,560
vulnerability or

1318
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,240
an undisclosed undiscovered

1319
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,760
vulnerability affecting a lot of

1320
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,520
organizations

1321
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,920
this actually started with our research

1322
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,920
that we did with ford and the

1323
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,800
interesting aspect here is pega is

1324
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,560
actually like

1325
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,240
manufacturing um or workflow automation

1326
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,280
kind of software that you can use um

1327
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,800
and specifically

1328
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,359
it's problematic because only employees

1329
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:32,640
have access

1330
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,280
within pega so if you can steal tokens

1331
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,480
which in our case we could steal uh

1332
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,880
actual tokens of the pega application

1333
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,359
you could potentially authenticate via

1334
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:46,800
uh sso services single sign-on services

1335
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,880
within the organization and take over

1336
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,400
the organization

1337
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,000
and that's that's not even mentioning

1338
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,079
all the proprietary data that usually

1339
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:58,560
gets stored in within pega systems like

1340
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,920
equipment information uh problems

1341
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,599
tickets for workflows and customer

1342
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,280
complaints and concerns and stuff like

1343
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,880
that there's a lot of different things

1344
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,000
that get stored in in pega systems so

1345
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,760
you know we're talking a lot about how

1346
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,720
do you me

1347
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,760
go ahead

1348
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,880
yeah i was gonna say the other thing

1349
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,160
you're right yeah go ahead sorry sir

1350
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,119
because we're gonna we're gonna wrap it

1351
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:18,480
up in a minute i think because john

1352
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,319
john's got the next session in like like

1353
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,680
four minutes is that right is that right

1354
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:37,649
[Music]

1355
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,640
this is a great conversation i think

1356
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,800
that you know as

1357
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,280
the threat landscape is always growing

1358
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,640
and accelerated and

1359
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,680
as you connect more

1360
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,119
devices in an ecosystem

1361
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,119
with iot

1362
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,680
ics

1363
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,680
embedded systems

1364
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,440
especially where you don't have the

1365
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,880
ability to

1366
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,440
cryptographically securely remotely

1367
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,680
manage and update and patch and things

1368
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,280
like that

1369
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,359
you end up with different vendors in

1370
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,839
this ecosystem communicating with one

1371
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:20,640
another and each of those can be a

1372
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,319
vulnerable point

1373
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:26,000
you have lots and lots more data being

1374
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,880
collected because it can be collected so

1375
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,760
regardless of the industry in the in the

1376
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,319
iot and ot space

1377
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,240
we're really seeing growth in the threat

1378
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,240
landscape and it's not slowing down it's

1379
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:42,240
accelerating it's not a fair statement

1380
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,480
yes

1381
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,079
and i think one of the things that you

1382
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,880
know as companies in whatever industry

1383
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,359
start to connect their

1384
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:53,359
traditionally mechanical equipment

1385
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,680
disconnected equipment to the internet

1386
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,640
that changes their risk exposure they

1387
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,280
need to start adopting an adversarial

1388
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,079
mindset which is what not what is a nice

1389
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,160
good customer or a white hat going to do

1390
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,160
with our technology what is a bad guy

1391
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,079
going to do and how are they going to do

1392
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:12,720
it and that's a maturity curve kind of

1393
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,640
like john said that it

1394
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,880
it takes time to develop that thinking

1395
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,960
hopefully you do it before you introduce

1396
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,359
the connectivity features but as we've

1397
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:22,720
seen time and again whether it's

1398
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,000
automotive

1399
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,119
medical devices often it's it's an

1400
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:28,400
afterthought

1401
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,480
and i think that's certainly true in the

1402
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,319
agriculture sector and it's unfortunate

1403
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:34,720
but there's going to be a painful

1404
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,800
period of adjustment um and i think

1405
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,000
we've just entered that

1406
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,160
paul i can give a good example to this

1407
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,160
man i really appreciate these questions

1408
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,000
from these people and this it just

1409
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,640
proves that like no matter what we can

1410
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,640
still reach out to people and

1411
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,400
answer their questions for stuff like

1412
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,559
this even if it's still a new technology

1413
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:56,240
this is this is really good that we were

1414
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,559
able to do this

1415
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:00,720
well i want to thank you

1416
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,040
all for your time today this was great

1417
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,800
um i'd be happy to

00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,200
to do a quarantine webinar

1419
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,640
uh we're going to be doing those

1420
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,079
throughout the year

1421
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,079
and yes we're going to try to build our

1422
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:13,680
audience on

1423
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,960
tv which is our youtube site

1424
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,480
and we will have this the presentations
