14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,640
let's get going and i'll uh

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,479
tell you a little bit about what we can

16
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,680
all do

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,160
a lot of this stuff is our things that

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,399
you know about it's good to see it all

19
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,920
in one place

20
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,879
and

21
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,800
we've got to get a little bit better in

22
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,320
how we're addressing things

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,160
so a little bit about me before we get

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,239
going i'm the founder of

25
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,800
security advisors llc

26
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,840
risk assessments pen testing

27
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,399
application security testing

28
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,280
um we don't do the cookie cutter reports

29
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,479
like the big

30
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,400
massive companies do and we're there for

31
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,600
you

32
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,640
i've

33
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,560
been acknowledged by issa as a matter of

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,640
fact that's the last time i saw a win at

35
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,560
the award ceremony

36
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,280
and he followed me so that's kind of

37
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,479
cute

38
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,520
i was a cso for 15 years then saw the

39
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,200
light

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,759
i'm currently the president of issa los

41
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:26,799
angeles

42
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,479
uh we actually with the founding chapter

43
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,280
of issa uh some 35 years ago or

44
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,600
something i found the

45
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,520
women in security forum out here in los

46
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,400
angeles and i did serve a couple of

47
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,799
years on the oas global board

48
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,479
um

49
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,159
so let's set the stage there's a

50
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,799
heightened environment in security all

51
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,320
around uh covet 19 has changed that

52
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,479
but um board rooms at least now have

53
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,159
security on their agenda on a regular

54
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,079
basis which is great

55
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,000
uh breaches are unfortunately

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,920
unfortunately for

57
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,560
us and our acknowledgement by the board

58
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,479
they're everywhere they're in mainstream

59
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,200
media our friends and family now come to

60
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,160
us and ask us security and i.t questions

61
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,319
in the past it would just be hey help me

62
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,440
with my

63
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,920
um printer but now it's security

64
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,080
questions so we're we're in the we're in

65
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,319
the mainstream which is about time even

66
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,920
the government's looking to help out

67
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,480
with regulations but

68
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,480
don't look for the government to solve

69
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,400
our security problems they're always

70
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,879
behind think about every legislation and

71
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,280
regulation that's been passed

72
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,200
congressmen senators they don't know

73
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,040
security they have aids that might help

74
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,760
but

75
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,879
uh but at least the regulations give us

76
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:41,920
some

77
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,720
uh

78
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,519
strength when we go to our board uh to

79
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:46,959
get some funding

80
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,519
and also for compliance right but don't

81
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,319
mistake compliance for security

82
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,959
um the reality is our data's leaking

83
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,040
everywhere phishing attacks they're

84
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,560
multiplying it's getting ridiculous

85
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,959
ransomware is up

86
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,760
the average time to contain a reach now

87
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,280
according to

88
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,400
an ibm report last year 280 days to

89
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,239
identify and contain the breach which is

90
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,280
crazy

91
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,599
and and most of the time

92
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,959
the fbi

93
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,519
notifies the company they don't even

94
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,040
have the awareness that they have been

95
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,319
breached

96
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,400
how i've had conversations and i'm sure

97
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,680
you have too

98
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,599
where your i.t director is telling you

99
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,840
well we haven't been breached and my

100
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,159
argument is how do you know you know

101
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,159
we're fighting to get the funding for

102
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,920
monitoring tools and you're telling me

103
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,440
you haven't been breached

104
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,200
does it sound familiar

105
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,959
and attackers today they're not like the

106
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,400
script kitties from yesteryear they

107
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,000
don't want to be found they want to get

108
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,400
in get out erase their footprints

109
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,640
and get your stuff and you don't even

110
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,000
know it

111
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,879
um

112
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,599
the times are changing right now there

113
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,200
are so many ways for you to be

114
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,480
compromised

115
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,959
uh and these are areas that you have no

116
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,040
input or control too often

117
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,840
the medical devices i used to work in

118
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,959
in county government and healthcare and

119
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,720
the people that were responsible for the

120
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,159
medical devices

121
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,680
they were just going out and buying it

122
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,680
and didn't have to vet it through me

123
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,080
so we had to do a search every

124
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,040
everywhere to find out our information

125
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,120
where our data is the back doors that

126
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,880
are being created by plugging stuff into

127
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,000
the network

128
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,320
um even the refrigerator and your

129
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,840
boardroom

130
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,400
tv monitor can be a target and

131
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,280
the fbi has warned consumers as well as

132
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,840
companies about these problems um you

133
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,840
know do you have a good iot strategy as

134
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,639
well

135
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,160
um you know iot problems are still there

136
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,720
i mean after all these years of iot

137
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,400
they're still coming out of the

138
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,560
manufacturer's insecure

139
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,960
it's improving a little bit but

140
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,320
you've got to make sure that you can

141
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,520
identify

142
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,320
and secure and isolate all those devices

143
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,560
on your networks so what the hell's

144
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,840
going on right we still are seeing the

145
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,280
same old vulnerabilities that we saw

146
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,160
when

147
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,800
2007 in the os top 10 we saw sql

148
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,600
injection it's still up there awas was

149
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,000
working on a new top 10 but in the

150
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,800
2017 version sql injection was still

151
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,479
there that's absurd

152
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,199
right there are recognizable ways to

153
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,639
solve these problems and we still see it

154
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,039
patching is still a major issue i still

155
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,120
have conversations with uh

156
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,800
enterprises and they go you don't

157
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,919
understand

158
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,600
to patch the whole enterprise on a

159
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,240
regular basis is just too difficult

160
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,720
well how about breaching and repairing

161
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,400
and coming back from a breach is that

162
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,520
difficult

163
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,360
change management we don't see enough of

164
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,280
that things are brought onto the network

165
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,919
the changes are made without the proper

166
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,720
management and and processes in place

167
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,880
configuration management

168
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,840
that's not happening on a regular basis

169
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,000
even printers and copies are still being

170
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,360
installed

171
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,360
with the default settings

172
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,840
so bottom line is our mission critical

173
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,720
information is not encrypted and data

174
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,039
can be exfiltrated this is getting

175
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,800
better okay and the encryption

176
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,919
discussion

177
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,400
is a lot better today than it was a

178
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,080
couple of years ago

179
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,960
um

180
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,400
well the main problem that we seem to be

181
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
facing now is our workforce likes to go

182
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,199
fishing and they're still clicking on

183
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,440
the links opening the attachments

184
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,840
it's very difficult

185
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,039
for a user who is focusing on one thing

186
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,120
for their job to think about security

187
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,560
all the time we could try all the

188
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,840
training we want but we do know

189
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,759
yes we can make inroads that can help

190
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,280
but there's a lot more that we have to

191
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,360
do and not depend on them as the

192
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,800
human firewall all right

193
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,960
in ransomware attacks are occurring

194
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,160
every 11 seconds and 60 of companies go

195
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,599
out of business within six months of

196
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,120
being victimized

197
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,639
so um

198
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,680
you know

199
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,599
security awareness is key to your

200
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,840
security

201
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,639
but

202
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,720
to just depend on that

203
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,400
as far as your workforce is not going to

204
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,440
work

205
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,599
a couple of recent breaches to give you

206
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,720
an idea of the scope and magnitude

207
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,400
these are all recent

208
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,520
15.7 million users were compromised

209
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,240
thanks to clear voice park mobile had 21

210
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,360
million users data compromised astoria

211
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,720
30 million

212
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,080
um infinity insurance oh 5.72 a small

213
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,840
one

214
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,400
um the workout tracking app jeff at nine

215
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,360
million

216
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,919
um and of course i put solo wins because

217
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,000
that was such a monster one we're still

218
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,840
trying to recognize the extent of that

219
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,319
breach there's still potential for

220
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,560
further damage caused have they

221
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,360
implanted other things on the devices

222
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,199
that they had access to

223
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,879
um

224
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,479
how about the costs for these data

225
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,599
breaches

226
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,080
uh the global average cost of a data

227
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,080
breach is up to 3.9 according to the

228
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,479
2019 ponemon report

229
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,879
uh extensive use of iot

230
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,199
has increased that cost by five dollars

231
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,440
per compromise record

232
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,360
uh if you were to look at a mega breach

233
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,120
of a million records

234
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,520
um that's an average total cost of 40

235
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,639
million

236
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,800
uh a huge company could absorb that

237
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,639
possibly do they want to

238
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,440
uh how about a 15 million uh record

239
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,520
breach which is becoming more and more

240
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,840
common with the incredible size of our

241
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,360
databases

242
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,680
uh that's a 350 million dollar average

243
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,879
cost

244
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,279
um third-party partner breaches can add

245
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,320
an extra 370 000

246
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,279
our partners are definitely an issue and

247
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,240
third-party risk assessments are key

248
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,399
uh so secure a little bit security

249
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,560
awareness right 70 percent of

250
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,560
organizations now say their senior

251
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,480
leadership has a comprehensive

252
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,720
understanding of cyber security or is

253
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,279
taking positive steps to improve

254
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,279
initially that sounds good but that

255
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,560
means a third of the companies don't

256
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,360
have the clue and are insecure that's a

257
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,800
lot of companies

258
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,519
77 percent are still operating with only

259
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,000
limited cyber security and resilience

260
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,680
and these are part of the ey global

261
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,760
information survey from a couple years

262
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,720
ago

263
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,760
87 of organizations warn they do not

264
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,920
have sufficient budget to deal with the

265
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,680
security issues and to implement what

266
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,800
they need

267
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,480
this is pretty

268
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,440
bad situation we find ourselves in

269
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,320
and

270
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,200
breaches are increasing as are the

271
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,600
sophistication of the attacks the past

272
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,760
few years we've seen that sophistication

273
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,959
jump

274
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,640
we remember several of the hacks that

275
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,959
have been going on in the breaches uh

276
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:39,760
we've

277
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,800
who can forget all the ceos of companies

278
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,000
coming out saying this was a

279
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,839
sophisticated attack

280
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,080
that finally started to get there

281
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,440
that was bogus back then and now every

282
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,839
organization is a target

283
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,200
i had discussions with my cio many years

284
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,000
ago

285
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,600
where he would say well we're not a bank

286
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,880
or finance but every piece of data has a

287
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,480
monetary value on the dark net

288
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,360
so what's a good security leader to do

289
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,440
first thing i recommend if you haven't

290
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,920
done it already go on tour

291
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,680
speak at the division meetings and the

292
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,680
general staff meetings make your face

293
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,000
known to the rest of your company go

294
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,240
into the different business units

295
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,399
make sure you have security awareness as

296
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,240
well for everyone

297
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,160
okay um

298
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,640
don't do what i'm doing

299
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,200
a presentation with powerpoint you're

300
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,120
going to lose your audience be creative

301
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,360
think of things that you can do gamify

302
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,120
your training is definitely one of the

303
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,880
more important things to do

304
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,360
pit division against division have

305
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,320
prizes award things for best security

306
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,360
advice

307
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,560
give people a a great parking spot for

308
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,040
the security uh person of the month

309
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,040
security champion if you will

310
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,920
um

311
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,120
if you're going to do phishing

312
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,880
simulations where there's a debate

313
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,959
whether that's valuable or not but i

314
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,440
would still recommend it as part of your

315
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,040
program

316
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,399
don't excuse and exclude the executives

317
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,720
they will say no no i can't be bothered

318
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,720
with this but guess what

319
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,560
they have access to some of the most

320
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,560
important data in the company

321
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,600
so um and they also feel they're above

322
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,440
the law if you will

323
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,279
so make sure that they're included um

324
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,120
and on every

325
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,200
meeting that has

326
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,240
the top level folks at your organization

327
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,079
your goal is to get security on that

328
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,479
agenda

329
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,839
patch management that's number one on my

330
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,040
list of technical things that you can do

331
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,880
uh you make sure you have processes in

332
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,600
place for you for your enterprise wide

333
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,720
patching

334
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,360
okay uh first start off with the pilot

335
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,519
group before you roll out any patch so

336
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,200
you can test it make sure and that pilot

337
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,160
group should be comprised of a sampling

338
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,120
of some of your key apps and key areas

339
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,040
just so you can see if anything breaks

340
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,880
or is affected

341
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,920
third-party apps very important i know

342
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,120
companies that

343
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,360
use a let's say the microsoft product

344
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,680
for patching and roll it all out and

345
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,160
they forget all the third parties but uh

346
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,320
but we know that adobe is not vulnerable

347
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,360
ever right

348
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,959
um

349
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,519
minimize the exclusion of systems

350
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,760
uh you will get if you haven't already

351
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,160
requests from system owners saying you

352
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,560
can't patch our system uh because it

353
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,320
hasn't been tested with the latest thing

354
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,320
or this is a key system we can't take a

355
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,040
chance but it's really a lot better

356
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,839
if you patch and something happens so

357
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,839
it's a controlled

358
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:42,959
event

359
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,240
rather than an unforeseen one from a

360
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,200
criminal

361
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,000
who

362
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,760
attacks the system because it wasn't

363
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,279
patched

364
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,279
always of course minimize effectively

365
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,000
uses make this transparent

366
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,399
if you do have systems that you're going

367
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,279
to have to exclude and there are cases

368
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,320
for this

369
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,959
do your best to have

370
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,360
exclusionary processes so those are

371
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,560
isolated systems for example

372
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,399
set firewall rules

373
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,360
that uh that system can't go out

374
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,680
anywhere that only certain groups of

375
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,720
users

376
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,120
can go into those systems they are

377
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,680
isolated through segmentation on their

378
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,959
own area

379
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,320
um

380
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,519
vlan's

381
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,360
firewall rules are definitely part of

382
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,120
every single good security program

383
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,079
um but don't just accept

384
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,560
the word of the system owner directly

385
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,600
contact the manufacturer or supplier of

386
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,399
that

387
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,199
app

388
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,440
and see if you can work with them

389
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,440
to

390
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,000
see if they can improve their patching

391
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,519
and and their testing um you will find

392
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,560
that

393
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,199
due to peer pressure other organizations

394
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,720
their competitors

395
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,040
they're stepping up their uh level of

396
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,720
security as well

397
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,560
and quite often the information that the

398
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,279
system owners have is antiquated and

399
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,120
they're not aware that those things have

400
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,360
stepped up this is particularly the case

401
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,839
in the medical field where all all the

402
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,680
pieces of medical equipment

403
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,120
are tested prior to deployment and they

404
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,120
just sit back and take their time but

405
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,959
but the pressure of competition is

406
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,680
improving that so don't just

407
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,360
take the word of system owners on that

408
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,079
meet with your key players okay every

409
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,920
company is organized differently the

410
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,440
culture is different don't just look at

411
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,600
an org chart because there are key

412
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,880
players

413
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,120
that have the ear of the c-suite uh how

414
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,880
you need to

415
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,639
get to know them they need to get to

416
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,760
know you

417
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,120
um so identify those key stakeholders uh

418
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,880
just do your best to have some lunch

419
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,959
with key executives and these people i

420
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,839
described it's worth you footing the

421
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,959
bill a few times uh human nature if you

422
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,639
pay

423
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,240
they will think they're a little

424
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,880
beholden to you in the future they'll be

425
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,560
more on your side

426
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,639
yes it sounds absurd but it's human

427
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,560
nature it happens and this is well

428
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,600
documented um

429
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,800
also meet regularly with key areas

430
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,639
throughout the organization

431
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,880
obviously the cto

432
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,880
but all the division heads make your

433
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,720
face known get to understand them what

434
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,920
their

435
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,920
what their culture is like

436
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,720
um legal and risk can be your best

437
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,440
advocates and your best support

438
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,000
they clearly have the ear of the

439
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,399
decision makers in every company

440
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,199
and

441
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,759
their and your job our job is risk more

442
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,959
than anything else so these are folks um

443
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,519
very important talk businesses i'll talk

444
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,880
about that later

445
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,639
but there is a way that you can

446
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,160
communicate with the upper level

447
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,160
management and it's not the way that we

448
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,160
communicate with each other where we

449
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,399
talk about attacks a number of attacks

450
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,440
they don't care about that

451
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,720
good configuration management is an

452
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,240
important part of any good security

453
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,199
program

454
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,079
uh

455
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,560
yes create your standard image deploy it

456
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,519
everywhere everywhere but you have to

457
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,279
update it and regularly test it because

458
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,920
you're going to make changes on it um

459
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,279
and don't forget your system admins

460
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,040
how many times have we heard stories

461
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,040
where the admin rolled up a system built

462
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,639
it from scratch didn't follow the

463
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,000
configuration

464
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,800
and

465
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,720
lo and behold he forgot to patch

466
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,240
something and there's a little back door

467
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,079
for your system so harden all your

468
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,560
systems based on that standard image

469
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,120
get the change management process in

470
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,480
place and regularly test it

471
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,079
if you don't have a change management

472
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,839
board form one

473
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,680
uh make sure there are key players from

474
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,480
application security field support

475
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,759
systems admin and network management all

476
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,079
those people need to be on there and and

477
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,839
they should be reviewing any change

478
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,520
that's not just a regular standard

479
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,199
change

480
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,359
on a regular basis and make sure you

481
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,760
know how to roll back and test that as

482
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,439
well

483
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,400
policies procedures and standards

484
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,799
we all have them we all know about them

485
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,240
but do yourselves big favor

486
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,480
in general policies are a bit harder to

487
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,319
deploy than procedures procedures you

488
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,839
write and

489
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,480
and certify and they're done policies

490
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,559
you've got to go through a lot of levels

491
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,559
to get them officially approved for the

492
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,760
organization hr has to get involved

493
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,120
so you don't want to change your

494
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,039
policies too often you only you want to

495
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,799
review them every two or three years

496
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,200
and keep them short policy is a

497
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,360
statement of what you're going to do and

498
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,679
the procedure is describing how you do

499
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:52,559
it

500
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,640
uh because procedures are fluid as your

501
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,600
technology changes as the environment

502
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,360
changes

503
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,480
you will have to change your procedures

504
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,440
so

505
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,360
review the procedures regularly keep

506
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,360
them updated when you build your

507
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,400
policies don't create policies that you

508
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,120
can't follow

509
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,720
you can create policies that you're

510
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,120
planning to follow with a few updates or

511
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,600
changes but you don't want to be in

512
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,080
non-compliant with your own policies

513
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,440
all right but clearly work with hr

514
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,360
make sure they're on board

515
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,280
because at the very least

516
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,000
you want them to require staff to sign

517
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,400
the acceptable use policy a good way to

518
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,200
do it is every year or more

519
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
when users are getting their performance

520
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,760
evaluation part of the package is the

521
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,840
acceptable use policy

522
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,080
um

523
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,440
a little application security stuff i

524
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,880
shared with you earlier that i was on

525
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,360
the owas global board i also ran the la

526
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,760
chapter for many years

527
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,679
this is not

528
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,480
what a lot of it and security leaders

529
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,280
talk about a lot but the back door layer

530
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,919
7 is unbelievably

531
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,720
dangerous and is all too often the way

532
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,919
that everything seemingly every

533
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,080
criminal hack occurs

534
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,600
uh so what's our what's our key job

535
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,039
make friends with the head of the

536
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,120
application development area

537
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,320
um

538
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,400
that's that's really important because

539
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,919
their whole focus is different than ours

540
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,400
yes they want security but

541
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,240
they're evaluated

542
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,039
on how fast and they can get their

543
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,120
applications rolled out

544
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,400
that's often if you're in a for-profit

545
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,039
company that's the way the companies

546
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,200
stay in business by rolling out new new

547
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,000
apps and building things and so they're

548
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,600
supposed to get those out as quickly as

549
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,840
possible

550
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,240
um infosec's got to be involved in every

551
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,000
single one of those rollouts every

552
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,600
software project and we need to be

553
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,520
involved in the beginning

554
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,200
not at the end

555
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,360
hopefully your company is past the point

556
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,320
where we

557
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,720
all too often found ourselves a decade

558
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,600
ago

559
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,000
where someone gives you a call and says

560
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,520
hey this app's rolling out tomorrow you

561
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,200
want to take a look at it tell me you

562
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,039
don't remember that that was scary and

563
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,600
when you looked at it and evaluated it

564
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,559
it was disaster

565
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,600
part of your program should be using

566
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,080
static and dynamic web app security

567
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,200
scanners

568
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,039
uh the

569
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,200
the static scanner lives with the

570
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,799
developers it's built into their process

571
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:35,679
um

572
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,320
and the dynamic is the one that

573
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,200
typically security team will run prior

574
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,600
to the deployment of every app

575
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,039
um

576
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,159
use software composition analysis tools

577
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,240
to look for third-party

578
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,400
uh vulnerabilities because everyone's

579
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,640
using libraries they're out there and

580
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,919
the vast majority are insecure

581
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,520
you can also look into a runtime

582
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,320
application self-protection but automate

583
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,200
as much as you can

584
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,000
hire a pen tester for all your critical

585
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,799
apps

586
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,559
you might have one on board

587
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,280
but it's time consuming it takes a lot

588
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,240
of effort and a lot of expertise

589
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,280
but all these automated tools

590
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,919
um they have their value particularly

591
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,799
when things are sped up now in the way

592
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,880
apps are being rolled out

593
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,440
but you still need someone to manually

594
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,640
check code

595
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,880
um and do some pen testing because you'd

596
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,120
rather you break into your system than

597
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,720
somebody else

598
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,600
um

599
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
now appdef staff

600
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,080
and my experiences

601
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,320
programmers really want

602
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,480
to do the right thing they want to code

603
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,679
securely

604
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,840
but if you look at the curriculums in

605
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,919
schools where application developers are

606
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,080
getting their degrees

607
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,840
these schools still don't have enough

608
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,840
security built into the system they've

609
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,840
got wonderful ways to teach

610
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,200
coding and

611
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,640
and shortcuts and modular uh security

612
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,640
i'm sorry modular uh development but

613
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,640
security's still not a great enough

614
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,640
presence on the curriculum

615
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,320
uh so

616
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,600
it's up to us

617
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,120
a little late in the game but better

618
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,640
than ever to look for training

619
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,440
opportunities i did that for the

620
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,039
application development staff where i've

621
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,400
worked

622
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,000
they were very

623
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,679
interested in getting this training

624
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,360
because again they want to do secure

625
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,720
code right

626
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,640
developers are very um careful they want

627
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,320
their babies

628
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,400
to be good looking and happy

629
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,559
and one way to do that is to make sure

630
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,000
they're secure and they understand that

631
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,840
but they just don't have that background

632
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,159
in training typically typically

633
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,480
so really look into working as a team

634
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,960
with your head of app dev and get that

635
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,520
training for them um there's lots of

636
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,880
different ways that can be done you're

637
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,799
going to be going up against a bit of

638
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,520
resistance schedule wise but again

639
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,760
they're all on that fast track and all

640
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,679
their time is supposed to be taken just

641
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,080
in development so time taken away from

642
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,480
that can impact the delivery schedule of

643
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,480
an app so you're going to have to

644
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,720
get that at the buy-in from your head of

645
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,320
application development if you can get

646
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,240
the buy-in from the head of your

647
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,520
organization

648
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,919
that's even better right but these are

649
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,679
things that you've got to do

650
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,919
um

651
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,559
oh wasp is can be a great friend for

652
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,200
your app dev team uh but you need to

653
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,640
learn more about owasp

654
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,480
a decade ago

655
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,720
i looked in the mirror and i said what

656
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,520
what do i need to do to improve my

657
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,840
abilities and knowledge uh as i see so

658
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,520
what you know we should these we should

659
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,440
do these checks on a pretty regular

660
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,679
basis because technology and everything

661
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,600
changes so quickly

662
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,000
i did not have a good background i mean

663
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,480
a few years of fortran and basic many

664
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,360
years ago that's not gonna cut it right

665
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,279
uh so i understood some concepts of how

666
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,120
coding worked but

667
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,960
um i needed to learn more about uh sdlc

668
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,760
and and application development so i

669
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,600
immersed myself in owasp and got very

670
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,679
involved there um

671
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,760
you should be doing something if you

672
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,640
haven't already uh the similar thing os

673
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,440
has tons of free tools free templates

674
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,720
frameworks

675
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,720
that

676
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,120
your organization can be using

677
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,320
uh

678
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,840
so if you get blowback

679
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,480
anyone in in the dev area

680
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,880
about the costs of putting security into

681
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,400
your apps

682
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,159
there's so much open source and free

683
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,320
tools from uh from all these dedicated

684
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,240
people worldwide who are building stuff

685
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,480
for all of us to use for free so that is

686
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,400
not an excuse

687
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,720
um don't forget about your physical

688
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,919
environment

689
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,240
some companies have a separation of

690
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,919
duties where you've got a

691
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,679
head of facilities and then you've got a

692
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,480
cso some companies have a cso which

693
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,320
typically encompasses the physical

694
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,960
security that's a more robust and a

695
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,960
better solution but typically the

696
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,640
facilities head does not have the

697
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,120
security training that any of us have

698
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,440
and so we've heard nightmare stories

699
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,720
about the

700
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,400
access cards

701
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,440
that are easily

702
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,480
copied by someone walking by with a

703
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,520
scanner

704
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,039
and

705
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,720
those are improving but there are still

706
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,360
companies selling insecure cards so

707
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,760
someone wants to wave the card by the

708
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,919
door to get in and you grab it and go

709
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:34,799
home and

710
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,320
put it on your system and make yourself

711
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,720
a card uh there have been several

712
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,840
stories about this uh

713
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,440
cameras you know i've did a scan and

714
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,200
found that the security camera that was

715
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,919
purchased by our facilities was not

716
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,679
locked down because out of the box

717
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,159
they're not secure it's an iot device

718
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,360
all right so think about all the

719
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,360
different things that you're ahead of

720
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,760
facilities is purchasing

721
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,960
also

722
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,840
uh

723
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,600
how about the maintenance schedule do

724
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
you have access to that to see you know

725
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,720
who's coming in and out what's going on

726
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,880
and i do have processes in place to make

727
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,880
sure people don't pick up a pc and walk

728
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,400
right out

729
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,240
i would not want to ask you to raise

730
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,480
your hand if you do on that particular

731
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,440
one

732
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,919
besides i couldn't see

733
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,640
monitor your systems on a regular basis

734
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,960
this is a really crucial part obviously

735
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,440
but it's not done well enough by a lot

736
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,960
of companies

737
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,240
um

738
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,159
are you able to detect anomalies on your

739
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,520
system

740
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,799
all right do you even know if you've

741
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,640
been compromised looking at that fbi

742
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,760
report that it takes 270 days to

743
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,480
identify and lock down

744
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,960
uh compromise is really a damning

745
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,919
statistic and tells me that most of us

746
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,039
don't

747
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,720
um

748
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,480
would you be able to detect for example

749
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,960
if you had outbound traffic to

750
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,440
companies or areas of the world that you

751
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,279
never deal with and your company has no

752
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,559
business with

753
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,880
things to think about that you can do

754
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,919
to help

755
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,440
um

756
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,480
you see any unusual behavior by any of

757
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,400
your employees

758
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,039
what i mean by that is if a

759
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,279
normal way that an analyst in a certain

760
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,960
area works is basically nine to five

761
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,039
handling you know

762
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:26,080
uh 50 000 to our 200 000 records per day

763
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,919
and all of a sudden

764
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,840
you're seeing reports that they are

765
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,840
working in the evening on

766
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,520
um in a million records

767
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,000
uh that should raise a red flag now they

768
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,760
might have a legitimate reason for doing

769
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,399
it

770
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:41,919
but it's something you should follow up

771
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,159
on and validate with the head of that

772
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,080
department hey is this

773
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,960
a

774
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,399
sanctioned behavior

775
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,880
is this appropriate is this okay

776
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,799
uh these are things that you should be

777
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,640
doing that seem out of place in your

778
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,559
organization do you have a way to

779
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:57,840
determine that

780
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,600
all right is there a way to raise red

781
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,279
flags for situations like that um

782
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,200
also

783
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,360
we'll see constantly people having

784
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,440
problems with with their credentials

785
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,159
logging in because the whole password

786
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,799
structure is garbage right we know that

787
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,799
has to change you know if you want too

788
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,720
complicated a password they're writing

789
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,760
it down

790
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,880
um

791
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,440
and and putting it by their desk if it's

792
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,360
not complicated enough then it's too

793
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,520
easy for a brute force or a dictionary

794
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,360
attack i mean we know passwords are

795
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,399
problematic

796
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,440
um

797
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,440
but are you looking for any kind of

798
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,120
patterns so if you if you know you get

799
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,480
10

800
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,799
calls to the help desk that a user can't

801
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,200
log in or this user can't log in right

802
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,200
but are you checking at the second level

803
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,640
do you have somebody monitoring and

804
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,720
looking for patterns or behavior

805
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,960
to see if you're under attack

806
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,960
right a hundred users all at the same

807
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,840
time

808
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,120
uh having problems or someone logs made

809
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,640
an attempt and then they're forced to

810
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,600
change their password uh so think about

811
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,440
things of that nature

812
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,039
um

813
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,880
as far as monitoring goes a lot of

814
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,360
companies are looking towards the cloud

815
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,120
looking towards third parties to help

816
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,039
them monitor their systems there's tons

817
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,320
of solutions

818
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,960
but just be aware all of those companies

819
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,120
are not created equal i've talked to

820
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,840
people on both sides my peers other csos

821
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,919
who said we've been saved by these

822
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,039
companies

823
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,679
because it's really difficult to hire

824
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,440
people to monitor

825
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,840
as their job and and if it's not their

826
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,600
job you're not doing enough monitoring

827
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,720
so this is

828
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,360
a difficult thing to do this burnout let

829
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,880
these companies

830
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,840
deal with that let let them

831
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,480
make sure they hire the right staff and

832
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,720
then when those staff need to move on

833
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,240
get someone else and also they're

834
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,080
trained in the latest technologies so

835
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,360
they understand

836
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,279
it's a large burden on you and your

837
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,200
company to do that training

838
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,200
many of you want that in-house and

839
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,679
that's fine and it works if you spend

840
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,480
the time and dedicate the resources to

841
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,520
do that

842
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,320
um

843
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,080
i've had other conversations with other

844
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,480
csos i said you know we found

845
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,279
we found areas of of problems and and

846
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,039
activity prior to these mssps so what

847
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,880
the hell am i paying these six figures

848
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,840
for

849
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,880
so

850
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,520
be careful before you go out there and

851
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,279
evaluate appropriately one of the best

852
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,520
ways is just word about talk to fellow

853
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,679
csos about their experience with

854
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,399
different companies

855
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,640
reporting is a key part of what we do on

856
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,559
a regular basis right

857
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:35,520
so

858
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,200
it's good to run your vulnerability

859
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,240
scans and it's good to clock them yes i

860
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,240
checked the compliance box

861
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,720
remediation don't forget create the

862
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,799
plans and follow up you're going to have

863
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,159
to work with it on this one obviously

864
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,320
but they're very busy and they'll put

865
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,799
this in in the second tier of their

866
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,440
plans as far as importance but you've

867
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,200
got to work with them and get upper

868
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,080
management to understand the importance

869
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,840
of remediation and then retest

870
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,840
right don't forget after you do a

871
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,519
vulnerability scan

872
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,039
make sure the remediation is done do

873
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,240
another scan

874
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,279
don't wait

875
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,440
i don't know how often you're scanning

876
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,360
some companies do it quarterly others

877
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,320
weekly others on an ongoing basis

878
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,720
but this should be a a serious aspect

879
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,880
also compare reports from various tools

880
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,559
uh for example

881
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,399
you your pa look at your patch

882
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,399
management your vulnerability scanning

883
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,519
your and your anti-malware dashboards

884
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,760
if you see systems

885
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,840
that are showing up

886
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,960
on your

887
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,519
vulnerability discovery scan but they're

888
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,480
not near anti-malware dashboard such as

889
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,799
mandecker mcafee

890
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,000
then it's showing that the agent is not

891
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,720
properly installed on those systems and

892
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,880
you've got a wide open system so you

893
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,480
better get out there so

894
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,360
think about these reports correlation is

895
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,320
key

896
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,000
um and

897
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,559
many times agents don't properly install

898
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,360
or fully deploy uh so there are issues

899
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,120
with that

900
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,559
so definitely

901
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,559
look at these reports and and think of

902
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,960
creative ways to find problems in your

903
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,720
system where you thought that you were

904
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,200
okay because you pushed out the agents

905
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,600
they don't always install correctly

906
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,880
um

907
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,559
access management

908
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,519
uh

909
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,039
this is a big one

910
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,480
uh

911
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,080
to get a proper

912
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,159
identity and access management system

913
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,279
provisioned is a major effort that

914
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,159
encompasses various areas of your

915
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:44,320
organization you need executive

916
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,640
management you need i.t you need system

917
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,039
owners and of course security

918
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,039
so and it takes it could take years to

919
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,679
deploy it correctly

920
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,600
so you've got to start with procedures

921
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,960
and standards

922
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,600
on your own in a manual fashion using a

923
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,799
combination of technology and process

924
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,440
an example

925
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,919
we did not have iam

926
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,799
and so what we would do is

927
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,600
contact every system owner

928
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,799
get a report of all the users in each

929
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:17,919
system

930
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,320
and their access level

931
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,960
gave it to the system owner and said i

932
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,720
need you to sign off that all these

933
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,960
people still need access and at that

934
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,240
same level

935
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,799
people change jobs people move on

936
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:31,679
um

937
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:32,640
and

938
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,559
to have them still having access to

939
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,000
systems

940
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,440
is clearly inappropriate

941
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,480
also work with your

942
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,519
hr

943
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,840
to make sure that you are notified when

944
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,519
people leave

945
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,399
and have this as a standard process

946
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,559
so you know that you can de-provision

947
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,000
their access

948
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,880
uh one problem of course is

949
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,200
the de-provisioning in all the different

950
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,880
systems that they might have access to

951
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,360
well that on iam system is hard for you

952
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,039
to know so you have to work with the

953
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,960
system owners and the division heads

954
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,679
because they know where their people are

955
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,079
multi-factor authentication i think

956
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,320
we're past the point where we can say

957
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,399
that's just for the admins

958
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,000
and and heaven help you if you're

959
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,480
administ don't use that

960
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,359
but

961
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,159
every critical system that you have that

962
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,399
if your company didn't have access to

963
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,480
that system they would cease to function

964
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,960
in a normal fashion or take irreparable

965
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,918
harm

966
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:35,119
those systems need mfa for everyone

967
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,960
all right uh you should also look into

968
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,359
the possibility of mfa across the board

969
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,639
but that's a larger fish and um that

970
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,480
could be the next phase

971
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,639
right um also

972
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,879
for your admin team

973
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,359
they love to log in with their

974
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,760
access to everywhere credentials but

975
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,760
what they should be doing they should be

976
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,240
working as a regular user

977
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,440
uh and then if and when they need to

978
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,079
jump in and do some access

979
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,320
and management admin work

980
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,200
then

981
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,640
that's when

982
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,560
they'll need to use their admin

983
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,800
privileges and only then that's a tough

984
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,040
one to work with but if you get your

985
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,400
admins

986
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,160
in a room maybe a lunch and learn uh

987
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,599
that might help

988
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,800
um did i mention patch yes i did for me

989
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,480
this is number one on everything i'm

990
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,079
talking about today

991
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,839
everything and i think many of you will

992
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,119
agree with me

993
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,359
if if systems were patched nothing

994
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,680
special just normal patch there would

995
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,240
have been no equifax breach

996
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,479
um

997
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,440
75 percent of risk in my opinion to be

998
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,680
mitigated with with just a decent patch

999
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,359
management program

1000
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,680
uh even wannacry would not have happened

1001
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,440
if your systems were properly patched so

1002
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,839
the best takeaway from all of this today

1003
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,320
is to huddle with your head of i.t

1004
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,160
and figure out how you can work together

1005
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,320
to get this done try to get through all

1006
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,640
the excuses of why it's not a good

1007
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,359
enterprise patching process on a regular

1008
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:06,720
basis

1009
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,920
um

1010
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,680
incident response

1011
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,599
uh what's the goal to minimize the

1012
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:16,079
damage lock it block it and stop it um

1013
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,839
you've got to come up with an incident

1014
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,920
response plan ahead of time

1015
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,000
and test it

1016
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
too often we see

1017
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,880
just like backup right backups or

1018
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,560
we have backup we're good but did you

1019
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,359
test it um a good incident response plan

1020
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,200
needs to be tested regularly

1021
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,440
um every organization has slightly

1022
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,200
different threats so you have to figure

1023
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,839
out what those are

1024
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:41,760
um you have to get the right people on

1025
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,160
the team this is not just a security

1026
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,040
item

1027
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,760
this is company-wide you want finance

1028
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,359
public relations attorneys if you're

1029
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:50,560
breached

1030
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,400
only the communications or public

1031
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,000
relations people should be addressing

1032
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,040
the media

1033
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,640
no one else of course you'll be

1034
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,640
contacted now this is if it's a high

1035
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,359
profile breach right but still uh

1036
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:02,800
they're there finance needs to be

1037
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,359
involved as i said um

1038
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,920
and you need to have the right level of

1039
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,839
communication internally to know who to

1040
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,599
notify and what to do

1041
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,240
so this is important um

1042
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,920
you know having an incident response

1043
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,000
team reduces the cost of a breach on the

1044
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,200
average of 360 000 according to the 2019

1045
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,079
ponyville report so

1046
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,720
may may not seem like a lot of money but

1047
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,280
uh the the turmoil that i can cause

1048
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,400
internal

1049
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,720
uh is just amazing for those of you

1050
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,839
who've gone through this you can

1051
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,079
understand

1052
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,480
encryption i mentioned it earlier we are

1053
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,480
past the point where your data should

1054
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,320
not be encrypted

1055
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,440
we're all encrypting data at transit but

1056
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,839
it's time that every piece of data in

1057
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,320
your organization has encryption

1058
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,520
um

1059
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,359
i know that there uh

1060
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,599
a fellow ciso several years ago told me

1061
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:56,400
about

1062
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,880
someone broke in took picked up this the

1063
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,359
pcs and took them home and somebody had

1064
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,760
forgotten to turn on encryption and so

1065
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,680
now they had access to all this data so

1066
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,440
first it shouldn't be stored locally

1067
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,240
second everything should be encrypted

1068
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,640
you might have some very creative

1069
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,480
developers who want to build their own

1070
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,800
encryption algorithm

1071
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,800
no not acceptable

1072
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,040
the reason is even though that might be

1073
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,280
different and there might be a release

1074
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,440
of an algorithm of an encryption that's

1075
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,040
standardized

1076
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,960
there's no there's not enough testing of

1077
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,960
that right uh so that is a potential

1078
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,359
uh way right into your network don't

1079
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,680
don't get fancy use accepted

1080
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,960
um

1081
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,320
encryption um

1082
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,520
key management is a big part of this

1083
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,920
uh i've heard of cases where the key and

1084
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,240
the data were on the same server and not

1085
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,760
the best idea

1086
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,079
rotate your keys make sure you know who

1087
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,400
has access to the the keys

1088
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,200
um

1089
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,440
very important that you

1090
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,480
also

1091
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,000
check out which

1092
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,720
protocols are being used in your apps

1093
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,960
and in your systems

1094
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,119
um we're still seeing

1095
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,720
ssl

1096
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,000
uh and telnet which is crazy

1097
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,400
people have been moving to tls but

1098
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,359
are they at a minimum at 1.2 1.3 is even

1099
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,640
better

1100
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,520
um

1101
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,599
regular backups

1102
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,520
regular backups are

1103
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,400
the

1104
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,280
one thing that can help you recover from

1105
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,079
a ransomware attack but only if you've

1106
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,480
got backups that are not connected to

1107
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,040
your network back it up pull it off now

1108
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,720
of course you want the ones that are

1109
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,560
there for just regular

1110
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,960
uh backups when someone blows away a

1111
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,040
directory and unintentionally in your

1112
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,240
organization

1113
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,400
but

1114
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,480
critical data has to be backed up on a

1115
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,839
regular basis

1116
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:53,200
there are tools now that can do

1117
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,359
snapshots so it's ongoing backup so

1118
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:56,400
you're really

1119
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,480
minimizing any loss at all

1120
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,480
as i mentioned the off-site backup is

1121
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,560
crucial for many reasons if something

1122
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,800
happens at your site some physical

1123
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,520
attack occurs or some

1124
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,200
unforeseen incident and we have

1125
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,880
earthquakes here where i live and i'm

1126
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,960
sure there are storms where you are

1127
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,160
uh

1128
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,680
you want someplace else where you can

1129
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,680
get your back up you'll then have to do

1130
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,440
an evaluation of um

1131
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,160
you know what what your critical data is

1132
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,359
um

1133
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:28,800
and some people are backing up to the

1134
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,640
cloud they just took this off their

1135
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,760
plate and said you know what i'm not

1136
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,599
going to be dealing with this

1137
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:34,720
um

1138
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,280
one thing that i want to point out when

1139
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,119
it comes to ransomware and i mentioned

1140
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,359
earlier

1141
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:44,400
companies are not testing

1142
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,319
the full restore

1143
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,000
so when they go to

1144
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
restore the data after a ransomware

1145
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,400
attack upper management is thinking okay

1146
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,160
we'll be back in business

1147
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,760
there are cases where it could take a

1148
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,280
week or two

1149
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,240
because

1150
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,079
there's only a certain fixed

1151
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,000
pipe that the data is flowing through

1152
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,400
and there's a lot of data

1153
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,000
and that blows away up management they

1154
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,480
had no clue about this so make sure that

1155
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,560
this is part of your process that you've

1156
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,079
had these discussions with upper

1157
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,079
management they understand

1158
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,440
and

1159
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,240
some

1160
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,520
i hate to say this but some

1161
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,119
organizations

1162
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,920
do a risk assessment and decide we're

1163
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,359
not going to have this big spin with

1164
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:25,599
security because we worst case will just

1165
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,040
restore

1166
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,800
well if they know what's involved they

1167
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,800
might reconsider their budget for

1168
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,720
security

1169
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,880
and this leads on to disaster recovery

1170
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,240
plan of course

1171
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,480
uh make sure you have an actual

1172
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,480
organizational structure

1173
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,119
where key business stakeholders are

1174
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,240
involved

1175
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,520
um

1176
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,280
your recovery time objective and

1177
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,920
recovery point objective have to be

1178
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,359
um

1179
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,079
established uh upper management are the

1180
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,720
only ones that can be involved in this

1181
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,200
this is not a security decision

1182
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,400
um

1183
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,839
they have to identify the critical

1184
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,680
systems they have to prioritize each

1185
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,079
system which one will come back first

1186
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,359
um

1187
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,440
tie this into your business continuity

1188
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,839
plan hopefully your organization has one

1189
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,680
business continuity plan is not a

1190
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,119
security project right security is

1191
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,119
involved and as a key player but don't

1192
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,079
take that on that is business plan

1193
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,520
um

1194
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,920
and you have to test it again

1195
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,319
just like incident response then people

1196
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:31,359
are not testing these plans often enough

1197
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:32,079
so

1198
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,319
this needs to be done

1199
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:35,599
um

1200
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,400
your network this is what your i.t folks

1201
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,160
think about when they think of security

1202
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,839
just this slide all the other stuff

1203
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:43,920
we've talked about that's that's for

1204
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,680
security practitioners

1205
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,119
um

1206
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,079
i have a network architecture plan

1207
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,319
i've seen so many companies where things

1208
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,160
are built on the fly and there's no

1209
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,000
overarching plan for you to study or

1210
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,520
evaluate to see

1211
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,400
what the interfaces are where the data

1212
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,880
is all the touch points

1213
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,560
you also need to find monitor your

1214
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,400
firewall performance

1215
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,160
i talked about segmentation earlier

1216
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,319
that's a no-brainer it has to be done

1217
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,160
and i would recommend hiring an

1218
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,079
independent network pen tester unless

1219
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,800
you have someone on board

1220
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,920
too often well people will misunderstand

1221
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,760
the term penetration testing and they'll

1222
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,760
say well we do our vulnerability scans

1223
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,160
totally different

1224
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,920
if you want to

1225
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,800
identify your gaps and vulnerabilities

1226
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,359
before someone else does that's a key

1227
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:36,720
part of your

1228
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,480
processes

1229
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,480
your remote workforce have to be

1230
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,839
performed

1231
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:44,880
uh excuse me secured um

1232
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,599
i think every company pretty much is now

1233
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,640
uh using vpn for remote access

1234
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,720
uh but quite often

1235
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,000
there are areas of vulnerabilities even

1236
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,119
with the vpn infrastructure

1237
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,119
think about it

1238
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,640
in order to use a vpn you got to punch

1239
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,960
holes in your firewall

1240
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,599
but what what about instead

1241
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,839
of punching holes in your firewall which

1242
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,000
obviously create an issue you just have

1243
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,440
some device or system internal

1244
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,440
pulling outwards looking for anyone who

1245
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,119
might want to come in and that way

1246
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:20,720
there's no one from the outside coming

1247
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,359
into a hole it's only one directional

1248
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:25,359
and that's that's a little bit better

1249
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:27,359
also

1250
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:30,640
i cannot believe still how many people

1251
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,520
that i know and maybe in your workforce

1252
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,040
who don't understand

1253
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,599
that just because starbucks and the

1254
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,280
airports are giving you wi-fi doesn't

1255
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,040
mean you should use it now if you've got

1256
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,160
vpn installed on your systems okay a lot

1257
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,040
better

1258
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,880
but i try never to use any of those

1259
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,839
systems if i'm on travel if i travel i

1260
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:52,079
plug my laptop into my phone and i use

1261
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:53,119
my phone

1262
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,520
um so

1263
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,119
it's something that you should stress in

1264
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,640
your awareness training to your staff

1265
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,960
um the fact that you're here listening

1266
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,480
to me

1267
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,839
hopefully you are

1268
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:07,359
means that you understand the importance

1269
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,280
of networking and collaboration so

1270
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,880
that's good keep it up

1271
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,920
um

1272
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,680
look at the folks sitting next to you

1273
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,839
and and just strike up a conversation

1274
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:18,480
with them uh when i'm done and try to

1275
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,640
get their contact info because the more

1276
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,160
people that we are engagement the more

1277
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,079
people we know the better chance that we

1278
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:24,880
have

1279
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,000
of dealing with the collaborative

1280
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,359
infrastructure of organized crime

1281
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:35,520
uh billions of dollars is spent on a

1282
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,119
regular basis

1283
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,520
by these organizations to look for ways

1284
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,839
to hack us to share their data

1285
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:43,839
to share their tools

1286
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:45,520
to

1287
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,000
have you buy tools and get maintenance

1288
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,960
plans i mean this is a juggernaut for us

1289
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,800
to deal with it just as an individual

1290
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,359
see so in an organization is is

1291
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,119
ridiculous to think that we'd have any

1292
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,880
success

1293
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,119
so share your stories if you want to

1294
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:03,520
deploy something contact somebody first

1295
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,079
before you deploy it or purchase a tool

1296
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,640
don't even purchase something unless you

1297
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,680
decide

1298
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,079
that it's past muster by your

1299
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,880
collaboration efforts join local

1300
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,480
organizations

1301
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:22,079
such as uh infragard oas by saca issa

1302
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,160
fbi has cyber watch out there there's

1303
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,359
new groups

1304
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:28,720
look to me look for meetup now again

1305
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,200
a lot of this is tough during our

1306
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,040
covet environment but

1307
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,880
uh there are still virtual meetings that

1308
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,920
can happen um but so this is really

1309
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,280
important

1310
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,200
and then keep learning this is a

1311
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,720
lifetime

1312
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,640
goal not just professional goal

1313
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,560
but for our purposes there's so many

1314
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,560
ways you can get information

1315
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,720
i start my morning every day by looking

1316
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,240
at twitter

1317
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,240
not for the garbage that's posted

1318
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,400
because it is always every day there's

1319
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,480
always some good links to some good

1320
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,520
articles

1321
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,160
uh about either the latest breach or

1322
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,880
ways to improve your information

1323
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,480
security program

1324
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,359
um

1325
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,720
books are still important a lot of us

1326
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,480
don't have the time for books but you

1327
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,400
should make it part of your

1328
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,520
regular

1329
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,040
reading

1330
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,480
take some more classes you're going to

1331
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,720
continue to still learn a lot of great

1332
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,480
podcasts out there some of the people

1333
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,800
speaking today have great podcasts

1334
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,920
um

1335
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,359
so continue with this

1336
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:33,280
and also help prepare the next

1337
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,800
generation

1338
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,839
we are in a crisis right now there's not

1339
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:39,920
enough of us around

1340
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,559
to fill all the job openings

1341
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:43,920
and yes

1342
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,119
part of it

1343
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,000
is a problem with the way hr lists the

1344
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,400
job openings when you see a cissp

1345
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,480
required for an analyst position

1346
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,160
you scratch your head do they really

1347
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,800
want to fill that position

1348
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,880
we know about a lot of the problems with

1349
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,839
that

1350
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:02,480
but we want diversity in the workforce

1351
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,920
we want students to want to work in it

1352
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,480
we want a warm and welcoming environment

1353
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,800
um we want to support competitions we

1354
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,680
want to

1355
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,000
teach schools if we can just you know

1356
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
part time i've done that

1357
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,720
um and so help the next generation but

1358
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,839
be open towards uh diversity which will

1359
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:25,040
help tremendously

1360
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,559
i mentioned business ease earlier

1361
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:29,680
you want to

1362
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,240
address executive management on their

1363
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,200
terms

1364
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,960
all right do they have the information

1365
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,200
that they need remember what's our goal

1366
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,599
our goal is not to be traffic cops our

1367
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,280
goal is not to tell upper management

1368
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,040
what they should and shouldn't do our

1369
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,160
goal is to point out what the risks are

1370
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,440
in our environment today and what we

1371
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,800
think can be done to reduce the risks

1372
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,440
okay um

1373
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,160
make sure that your strategy is matching

1374
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,079
the business

1375
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,040
risks

1376
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,079
um and keep the dialogue about two

1377
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:05,599
things

1378
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:08,000
risk and money that's it

1379
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,640
right don't go to them with spreadsheets

1380
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,680
of the number of uh of attacks

1381
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,440
or the number of

1382
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,280
tax you caught

1383
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,640
they don't care

1384
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,800
risk and money that's it

1385
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,160
and then there's cyber insurance okay

1386
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,160
word of caution about cyber insurance

1387
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,559
first of all it's becoming more and more

1388
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:31,280
a necessity for most companies

1389
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,520
because it's not a question of if you

1390
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,480
will be compromised but when

1391
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,760
and insurance can help with some of the

1392
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,040
financial

1393
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,599
losses associated with that

1394
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,359
but

1395
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:47,920
many many companies today are holding

1396
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,480
more data than a single insurance

1397
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,800
company will be willing to ensure

1398
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,319
so you'll need to get a supplemental

1399
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:56,079
insurance with a different company as

1400
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:57,119
well

1401
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,520
so consider that a lot of companies are

1402
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,599
not aware of that they're painfully

1403
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,920
becoming aware after the breach

1404
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,200
when they're only getting a certain

1405
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,240
amount of money and half of their

1406
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,480
their financial losses are just

1407
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,520
right off

1408
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,720
um additionally

1409
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,280
i've seen situations now first of all

1410
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,680
every insurance company wants to vet

1411
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,440
every client first they want to know

1412
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,559
what you're doing because they want to

1413
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:23,920
know what they're securing and if they

1414
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,079
even want to get involved with you so

1415
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:28,480
you're going to get a report to complete

1416
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,720
which asks you about your security

1417
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,720
posture it's a risk assessment similar

1418
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:35,760
to what we would do for a third party

1419
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,319
right so they're asking us hey check off

1420
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:41,680
what you have and what you don't have

1421
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,640
make sure that you see that report and

1422
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,000
that upper management just doesn't have

1423
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,599
somebody fill it out and check every all

1424
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:49,839
the boxes off because what happens and

1425
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:51,760
there are plenty of documented cases

1426
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,960
about this

1427
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,119
you check out every box we have this we

1428
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,359
have this and then the breach occurs if

1429
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:58,800
you submit your request for

1430
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,440
reimbursement from the insurance company

1431
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,359
they come out they check out what

1432
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:06,079
happened what they do an assessment and

1433
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:07,599
they say wait a minute you checked off

1434
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:09,200
you had all these things in place you

1435
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,280
checked off that you test your incident

1436
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,200
response plan and you test your your

1437
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,040
disaster recovery plan

1438
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,359
but we don't it's been three years since

1439
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:19,520
you had any any kind of test we're not

1440
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,640

1441
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,880

1442
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,760
this happens so make sure that you're

1443
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,319
