ian garrett going to give a great talk

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,120
here on hybrid work security how it's a

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,879
little bit different from the remote

19
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,320
nightmare that you've all been living

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,360
last year

21
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,640
um and then we're also going to go

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,160
through a

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,719
almost chew through an adventure the

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,399
campaign towards the second half of this

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,480
and we'll go to a day in a life of

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,239
someone that uh

27
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,559
living a hybrid work world

28
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,040
so who am i who is this guy

29
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,360
um so yeah long story short love

30
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,080
building things love breaking things

31
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,240
usually on purpose

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,560
but accidental you know hey lesson chaos

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,960
energy i'm currently ceo co-founder of

34
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,759
phalanx for data security company um

35
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,600
prior to that i did some work either

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,600
with pm data scientists in the defense

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,600
industry even prior to that um it's

38
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,040
actually an army cyber

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,200
offensive center capabilities so

40
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,759
um again like building things that break

41
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:34,799
things

42
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,880
and also my phd research is also focused

43
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,640
in an intersection of cyber ai so if

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,680
there's any of that that you're

45
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,280
interested in definitely follow up with

46
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,399
me afterwards

47
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,360
um and hopefully we'll talk to you off

48
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,079
so remote versus hybrid work

49
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,200
isn't this

50
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,000
stale news that's so 2020 right so you

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,159
know we've been dealing with the issues

52
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,079
of remote security for the last year a

53
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,320
lot of those impromptu put together

54
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,200
um but you know really with with hybrid

55
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,640
it is different so we'll cover those

56
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,159
differences but just a quick show of

57
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,960
hands how has anyone been affected by

58
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,399
you know remote remote security uh did

59
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,800
that cause you any issues at work

60
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,959
quick show of hands did anyone find

61
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,959
challenges with that or has it has been

62
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,280
a great year for everyone looking

63
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,120
looking like remote security didn't

64
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,800
cause any problems

65
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,080
except for maybe the guy in the back

66
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,680
all right so remote work versus hybrid

67
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,640
work

68
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,319
so you know pre-code

69
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,760
if you thought about remote work was

70
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,360
really you know people that were in the

71
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,519
office were in the office people that

72
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,200
were remote you know generally were

73
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,840
remodeled either traveling or were

74
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,280
full-time remote

75
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,640
and what that really meant was that

76
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,200
people had you know understood what they

77
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,800
needed to do

78
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,720
weren't necessarily the biggest targets

79
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,599
out there

80
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,640
and um you know they were used to it the

81
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,160
people the office they had everyone had

82
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,760
their own habits that built in you know

83
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,280
what happened last year

84
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,000
it

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,840
went to stray chaos and it was like now

86
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,879
people who used to have in-office habits

87
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:05,680
were

88
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,280
at home and you know

89
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,800
doing whatever doing whatever they

90
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,680
wanted to do accessing their work emails

91
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,959
on the personal devices accessing um

92
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,200
you know vpn from any location and

93
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,280
because of that a lot of companies did

94
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,080
go into just really just ad hoc uh

95
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,840
systems trying to grab what was out

96
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,080
there and just kind of piece it together

97
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,480
to make it work um and you know what

98
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,560
we've all witnessed is that on the

99
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,239
attacker side that was just that

100
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,040
everyone had a heyday with it um

101
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,680
so you know generally and last year

102
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,680
because kovit you know a lot of people

103
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,319
remote remote work meant staying at home

104
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,640
not necessarily like going to mexico and

105
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,120
working for mexico so um what we're

106
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,400
seeing now is that's changing with

107
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,480
hybrid work so instead of just

108
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,480
necessarily staying at home or in the

109
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,920
office you know people are able to have

110
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,760
that mix you know you can spend two days

111
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,239
at home three days in the office or you

112
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,680
know workations are getting bigger

113
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,400
escovid is um you know going over it's

114
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,239
like hey now if i want to work remotely

115
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,920
that means i'm going to go to maybe

116
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,239
seattle for a couple for a week and then

117
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,680
go over to texas for another week and

118
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,159
then come back to the home office and

119
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,400
you know as you can imagine a lot of

120
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,120
that opens up your attack surface so it

121
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,440
can be a lot more than just home just

122
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,199
office it could be really just anywhere

123
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,880
and how do we protect against that how

124
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,880
do we figure out a strategy that deals

125
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,479
with you know you really don't know

126
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,720
where people are

127
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,479
so again just hitting up you know just a

128
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,639
recap on how last year was

129
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,040
uh not great for everyone

130
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,199
you know so social engineering and

131
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,800
phishing attacks also obviously the

132
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,320
number one attack vector you know

133
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,000
skyrocketed last year and why is that

134
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,800
the case anytime there is uncertainty or

135
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,960
you know just in general chaos

136
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,639
that's when you know these attacks

137
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,560
thrive and that's because a number of

138
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,120
reasons as you imagine you know

139
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,240
you don't really know what the ground

140
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,919
truth is out there you know people are

141
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,919
getting all kinds of emails a lot of

142
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,520
everyday you know something news coming

143
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,880
out so as

144
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,520
as people are open to the idea of more

145
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,560
and more

146
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,160
uh things out there you know they're

147
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,680
willing to click on a lot more willing

148
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,199
to download a lot more and willing to go

149
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,120
places that they normally wouldn't have

150
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,639
and accept truth from a lot of places

151
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,880
that they wouldn't have um

152
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,240
and obviously that makes it easier to

153
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,120
fish them so also you know again at home

154
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,880
you know people are used to doing what

155
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,240
what they do at home anyway so i was

156
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,000
like hey i got my work computer but i

157
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,680
actually have my personal laptop let me

158
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,520
just you know we have cloud everything

159
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,520
let me just log into all my work stuff

160
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,600
on my personal laptop but maybe your

161
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,039
personal laptop doesn't have all the

162
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,000
controls that your work laptop would um

163
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,840
so again really bringing in that

164
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,919
availability to access that normally

165
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,840
wouldn't occur you know in the standard

166
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,240
office workplace and then of course you

167
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,320
know we're all more comfortable at home

168
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,880
so what that really means is

169
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,320
we're going to be just less security

170
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,080
conscious in general and there's less

171
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,240
peer pressure from your peers being like

172
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,000
hey did you see that fishing like that

173
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,199
email as a phishing attack you're like

174
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,240
oh that was that was a phishing attack

175
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,520
so i was like at home you know people

176
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,759
that more distracted less security

177
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,080
conscious and that and that that alone

178
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,560
is causing enough issues so

179
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,080
you know 2020 is passed we're moving

180
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,720
into newer bigger problems

181
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,840
um so again you know just

182
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,600
hit you with a quick stat at 56 percent

183
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,280
of it technicians believe you know

184
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,880
employees picked up bad cyber habits of

185
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,880
the last year you know that's that's the

186
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,120
reality is that you know we

187
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,120
get comfortable you know we're still

188
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,199
navigating the the new normal or

189
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,280
whatever but you know what we're finding

190
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,680
is that people have really established

191
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,919
new cyber habits at their own and

192
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,120
they're ready to bring that into the

193
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,880
office so you know either that takes

194
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,919
retraining on employees-wise or finding

195
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,919
new controls that really adapt to you

196
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,000
know this new reality

197
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,080
in addition to you know yeah people were

198
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,680
vpn again yes to get into the corporate

199
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,080
network but at the end of the day

200
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,720
with the rise of just cloud applications

201
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,400
people are able to do work without vpn

202
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,479
again but these devices that they're

203
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,000
bringing are coming in and out of that

204
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,840
corporate network both physically and

205
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,120
through vibm

206
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,400
so again that's causing uh havoc on any

207
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,840
kind of network security because they're

208
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,039
like hey we're just letting these

209
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,280
devices come in and out and you know

210
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,520
with that also is the rise of people

211
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,919
wanting to bring your own device so as

212
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:16,720
you

213
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,479
sure you all know bring your own device

214
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,039
is super hard to lock down unless they

215
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,120
are willing to accept those controls on

216
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,880
their personal devices

217
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,599
which is often not the case so

218
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,280
you know some of the biggest issues with

219
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,280
hybrid is really adapt to the fact that

220
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,520
people want to perform work in a certain

221
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,759
way and that's just bypassing a lot of

222
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,280
the standard cyber security controls

223
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,599
that we have today um

224
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,880
and then you know finally on this last

225
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,039
bullet here like network security

226
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,199
that was great you know 10 15 years ago

227
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,199
but we really need to move beyond just

228
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,639
pure network security obviously you need

229
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,560
to have it but you cannot just like say

230
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,000
that hey we have a perimeter that's

231
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,840
locked down sprinter i'm sure you all

232
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,280
know you know zero trust is like hey

233
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,360
this is not gonna work for us anymore

234
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,120
because there isn't really a perimeter

235
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,319
anymore yeah you have your corporate

236
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,319
office but a lot of smaller businesses

237
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,479
don't even have a corporate network

238
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,080
particularly if the majority of their

239
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,080
workforce is removed and planned to stay

240
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,599
in the mode

241
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,199
so going into just kind of like hey what

242
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,560
are some more issues with hybrid in

243
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,360
general like i said attack surface is uh

244
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,680
it's growing it's not just

245
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,520
so again you know if everyone's in the

246
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,120
office for the most part your tax

247
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,400
surface is really like how do we lock

248
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,080
down this corporate network and that's

249
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,440
what i'm giving them with what we saw

250
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,080
last year was remote work it's you know

251
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,319
people without it to de-prioritize the

252
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,680
corporate network but you know

253
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,320
prioritize my perimeter is now you know

254
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,240
this remote workforce and everyone's

255
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
remote how do i lock that down how do i

256
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,159
help that out you know we all pretty

257
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,839
much adapted at this point to that but

258
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:42,958
hybrid is

259
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,200
now you have to be with the in-office

260
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,000
people the remote people and all the

261
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,800
in-between and remote people not even at

262
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,320
their house like

263
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,480
home network can be pretty insecure but

264
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,240
now people are just going to random

265
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,839
public wi-fi and just doing work um

266
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,240
obviously not great right so that's one

267
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,839
of the biggest issues with hybrid is

268
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,440
it's a massive attack surface and

269
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,680
because of that it really requires a

270
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,920
shift in mentality and how do we

271
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,680
um how do we secure things instead of

272
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,880
thinking that it's networks and

273
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,320
obviously instead of even thinking about

274
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,720
as uh endpoints we need to really dig

275
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,240
down how do we authenticate each user

276
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,440
to the data that they're trying to

277
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,959
access and the actions they're trying to

278
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,040
perform um

279
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,360
vpn obviously you know hey

280
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,959
i'm sure you're all on a vpn right now

281
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,959
if you're connected to the public wi-fi

282
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,880
if you're not um i highly suggest it

283
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,040
but yeah vpn just like isn't isn't is

284
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,279
good but isn't good enough anymore um

285
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,560
and that's because you know as we

286
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,080
shifted into the remote workforce and

287
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,360
especially for hybrid um vpn creds are

288
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,920
now being targeted more than ever so

289
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,760
yeah having a vpn into your corporate

290
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,240
network's great but if those parents are

291
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,080
being targeted then there's more

292
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,839
attackers masquerading into your network

293
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,920
which is again if they're not physically

294
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,360
located you really don't know who's

295
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,120
jumping into your network

296
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,399
and that plays right into this next

297
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,680
bullet you know the previously ignored

298
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,399
tech approaches are gaining traction so

299
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,079
just because

300
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,240
having cloud apps wasn't necessarily a

301
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,480
big security thread back in the day just

302
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,320
because you know vpns are great it

303
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,920
doesn't mean that that's okay going

304
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,240
forward going to like now that now that

305
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,160
this is the new reality and this is how

306
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,880
more the workforces are uh interacting

307
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,839
with their corporate um and sees that

308
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,920
obviously attackers are shifting their

309
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,760
priorities away from

310
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,680
you know main creditors like corporate

311
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,120
networks and shifting towards like how

312
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,279
do we target these individual employees

313
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,880
um and then so that's going to cause a

314
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,160
lot more

315
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,160
again tax searches a lot more issues and

316
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,200
a lot more

317
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,680
uh unique attack venues than we have

318
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,560
seen before so you know it really goes

319
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,920
into how do we

320
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,240
protect our most important assets so

321
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,279
that if these are compromised um

322
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,399
you know our network and i'm going to

323
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,320
compromise like we're still able to

324
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,360
retain um security on what we need most

325
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,120
so hey what are we what are we doing

326
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,440
about it so on the personal device end

327
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,480
um

328
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,800
you know we really need to focus on on

329
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,480
tracking this right so and this is

330
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,839
difficult again because i mentioned

331
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,279
bring your own device

332
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,320
has a whole layer of issues associated

333
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,160
with that so

334
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,360
you know we want to be able to

335
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,200
understand what devices are supposed to

336
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,880
be connected to our network who's owns

337
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
those devices and you know where are

338
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,040
they going where they've been

339
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,880
if you want to bring your own device

340
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,480
into the corporate network maybe it

341
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,800
needs to be quarantined until it's

342
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,399
ensured all the all the patches are

343
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,880
updated you know it make sure it's clean

344
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,240
and did you go out of country or

345
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,399
whatever for a number of weeks and while

346
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,079
working over there like all of that is

347
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,360
important to take note and we need to

348
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,600
really be able to track that going you

349
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,360
know going forward to understand like

350
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,839
who's coming in what do they have and

351
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,560
are they supposed to be here um

352
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,000
unsurprisingly i'm sure strong

353
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,480
authentication so you know as we move

354
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,720
forward really understanding you know

355
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,519
if the person who's on the device is who

356
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,519
they say they are is the person even

357
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,040
accessing that data who they say they

358
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,920
are

359
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,839
this goes beyond just the insider threat

360
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,519
obviously but it really can be

361
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,680
especially remote you know you can't

362
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,000
even track ips anymore like

363
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,360
who knows where people are as they're

364
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,279
accessing and doing work and unless you

365
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,959
want to stop that as like a work policy

366
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,360
wise like you know again

367
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,360
instead of trying to fight what people

368
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,839
are trying to do let's all find a way to

369
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,639
you know really flip that concept and

370
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,440
like work with people saying hey you

371
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,360
want to work from

372
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,560
three different three different

373
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,560
locations all on public wi-fi for the

374
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,040
next three weeks how do i protect

375
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,040
your activities coming into the work

376
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,040
network to still enable you to do the

377
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,560
work that you want to do

378
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,560
a lot of that you know it shifts it's a

379
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,560
big shift from

380
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,480
hey let's build and buy capabilities

381
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,120
that are protecting big swaths of our

382
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,560
network and you know all of our

383
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,040
corporate devices to being more granular

384
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,120
and focused on you know the individual

385
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,040
itself needs to be

386
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,639
more aware than ever

387
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,519
um so what you know user education

388
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,959
obviously that's always been important

389
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,279
but more and more as we

390
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,519
you know focus on the individual

391
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,519
we need they need to understand what

392
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,560
what is reality like how do i enact do

393
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,480
my remote work in a way and hybrid work

394
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,639
in a way that is protecting my devices

395
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,480
protecting the network and really has

396
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,040
responsibility and ownership of their

397
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,200
own security and you know and how it

398
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,399
plays into the greater company um

399
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,600
and then some of the other things you

400
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,680
know that that we should be looking at

401
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,079
and again unsurprising here zero trust

402
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,839
right like i'm sure all of you are

403
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,920
probably tired about hearing zero trust

404
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,920
um but it is important right the

405
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,279
perimeters are getting smaller and

406
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,760
smaller you can't just even segmenting

407
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,519
networks isn't good enough anymore you

408
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,360
know we really gotta focus on not just

409
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,959
endpoints securing each one but how do

410
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,639
we protect the data within which goes

411
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,120
into that second point there zero trust

412
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,639
for the data you know you want to be

413
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,279
able to take that concept of zero trust

414
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,440
and really bring it down to to your data

415
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,519
to your files even so you know as you

416
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,760
can imagine if there's a remote um

417
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,680
remote access onto your device that's

418
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,240
maybe not you um maybe they masqueraded

419
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,160
as you they're on your device and

420
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,839
they're opening files at will or they're

421
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,600
shipping off files that will you know

422
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,760
you want to be able to say like

423
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,920
just because i'm on my laptop am i

424
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,680
really opening that file you know

425
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,600
something like that so really you know

426
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,839
you got to start getting as granular as

427
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,920
possible um

428
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,839
you know and going like in that last

429
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,079
point there could get deeper you know

430
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,000
how do we take our controls that used to

431
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
be good enough to say hey this network

432
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,800
is secure hey this cluster of devices is

433
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,120
secure how do we take that and bring it

434
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,040
more and more granular you know take get

435
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,680
rid of the concept of even like

436
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,880
event points right because if you think

437
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,760
about how all the cloud work we're doing

438
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,880
um

439
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,720
you know files and data is being passed

440
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,480
around multiple devices i can be logged

441
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,079
in on four different devices getting the

442
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,000
same document you know working on the

443
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,680
same document really got to get rid of

444
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,120
the idea of

445
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,600
having you know having these set

446
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,920
perimeters and saying like what is

447
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,600
important this data is important how do

448
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,240
we actually put controls on the data

449
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,839
while not putting too much of a burden

450
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,000
on the security status um for anyone

451
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,160
that has any security teams i i can't

452
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,760
imagine that here you have too many

453
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,160
people working there right so there's a

454
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,240
massive shortage of security personnel

455
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,199
across um across the industry so

456
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,519
so adding more logs and auditing adding

457
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,279
more work for them to put in controls

458
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,040
isn't the right answer how do we make

459
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,880
all that automated how do we really

460
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,959
focus on empowering the individual to

461
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,680
take ownership of their own security

462
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,000
so ultimately you know it's not a lack

463
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,279
of our

464
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,959
technology it's not a lack of our

465
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,440
capabilities we have plenty of cyber

466
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,519
capabilities a lot of smart people

467
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,680
solving smart problems but

468
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,560
if the users doesn't adapt it if people

469
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,160
are going to bypass it if people are

470
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,959
going to improperly use it then it's

471
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,240
gonna be useless at the end of the day

472
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,519
so the problem you know the problem is

473
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,000
technology people are the problem and

474
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,800
that's

475
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,320
that's not something i think anyone

476
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,759
would disagree with

477
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:04,880
if you do

478
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,120
let's talk after but you know we really

479
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,720
need to solve for the human problem here

480
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,639
and as and this really starts with you

481
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,959
know again a user education as automatic

482
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,120
is that make everything automated and

483
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,560
then really just focus on what's

484
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,759
important you know we don't want to get

485
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,519
in in the way of people doing works if

486
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,639
you get away with people doing work

487
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,320
they're going to bypass security how do

488
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,399
we work with people to enable if all

489
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,839
they want to do is get the job done that

490
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,839
they're being paid for and unfortunately

491
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,519
security isn't

492
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,440
in that job description yet but i think

493
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,279
you know the more we go forward the more

494
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,240
that needs to be part of um again

495
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,519
ownership

496
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,560
so

497
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,199
with that being said we have a choose

498
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,639
your own adventure so some of this will

499
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,399
be you know pretty pretty basic stuff

500
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,199
but hopefully entertaining stuff um

501

507
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,240

509
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,319

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,319
core so he he's not he's tech aware but

518
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,160
he's not very super security conscious

519
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,520
but he's done the training so you know

520
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,080
he's pretty okay um and again prick of

521
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,000
it he was totally in the office during

522
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,760
kova totally remote and now he's pretty

523
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,679
excited to be able to flex that that

524
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,960
hybrid uh

525
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,840
the hybrid work so first decision of the

526
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,120
day

527
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,360
where should olyn work

528
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,120
so yeah he he's

529
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,960
a coffee edit like

530
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,520
like myself and i'm sure many of you so

531
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,960
he's either gonna where is he gonna

532
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,160
drink his coffee he's gonna get some

533
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,600
coffee at home or is he gonna get coffee

534
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,840
at a coffee shop you know he's excited

535
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,520
he woke up you know he doesn't know

536
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,720
where he's gonna work this morning he

537
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,400
just knows he's not going to the office

538
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,000
he doesn't have the patience for that at

539
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,600
the moment and he's in desperate need of

540
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,080
coffee so you know he's known to make

541
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,720
some pretty poor decisions free coffee

542
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,600
um

543
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,039
and some pretty poor decisions after

544
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,280
coffee but either way you know he knows

545
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,559
that he can work from anywhere he's

546
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,400
gonna do that um

547
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,320
he has a work a laptop he's got a

548
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,240
personal laptop but he has cloud access

549
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,320
on either one he just usually defaults

550
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,919
to the work laptop but you know

551
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,160
sometimes he's gonna whip out the uh the

552
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,960
person want to do work so audience paul

553
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,520
where should he work uh show of hands on

554
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,880
home

555
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,520
okay one two three four five six seven

556
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,760
eight uh taco shot

557
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,600
one two three

558
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,559
all right

559
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,080
four

560
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,799
looks like home it is

561
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,559
working at home so this is something

562
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,080
that i'm sure we're all very familiar

563
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,440
with at this point

564
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,440
most important perk working at home is

565
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,000
never-ending flow of coffee um so yeah

566
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,160
owen's watching the news he sees that

567
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,160
the code vaccine boosters are actually

568
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,120
now

569
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,600
coming out required to keep his um

570
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,320
vaccination alive you know he had a

571
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,400
really hard time getting back initially

572
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
there was a big shortage so he's pretty

573
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,080
pumped to get that um he's also

574
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,520
distracted you know his wife's also

575
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,880
working at home he doesn't have kids but

576
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,880
he actually does have a dog um that's

577
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,640
constantly bringing him out every hour

578
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,080
um you know he's working working in his

579
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,960
pj's very cozy very comfortable but he

580
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,200
also is kind of a clean uh clean freak

581
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,960
so he he's constantly cleaning

582
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,039
constantly distracted getting work done

583
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,880
but you know always something on his

584
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,720
mind when it's at home

585
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,720
so second decision you know he's working

586
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,280
he's chugging along a wild email appears

587
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,080
you know

588
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,520
the coping vaccine booster shots are

589
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,320
available at pharmacies today and nearby

590
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,760
so you know at the bottom there's a

591
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,120
little email there's a little button you

592
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,280
can press uh that locates the nearest

593
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,640
booster shot so that's pretty nice

594
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,679
pretty easy um and he got it on cbs the

595
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,600
regular vaccine at cvs recently so he's

596
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,799
like okay hopefully they'll have it

597
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,720
again um so decision yes or no yes

598
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,480
one two

599
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,840
three four

600
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,600
who knows

601
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,559
one two three four five six seven eight

602
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,360
all right all right yeah so here we go

603
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,799
no

604
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,760
unsurprising fishing email right um

605
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,600
but hey i mean this is actually a huge

606
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,760
issue during covid it during you know

607
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,640
during the remote work is that

608
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,400
emails like that were coming out you

609
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,559
know attackers were actively using

610
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,640
um all any any information about

611
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,559
government as a weighted fish because

612
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,240
you know as we knew it was uh

613
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,159
decentralized right so it was like

614
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,760
straight up the grocery store was like

615
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,520
hey you get some vaccines here today for

616
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,520
free you're like oh okay

617
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,960
so like people were getting these emails

618
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,960
all the time half of them were legit

619
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,400
half of them were really not so they was

620
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,679
like hey

621
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,760

622
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,280
and people were like sure like i don't

623
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,799
know what's real and then obviously

624
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,640
newswise there was nothing that was

625
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,559
you know out there to say like hey only

626
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,960

644
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,039
and this is actually another big one

645
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,360
that's been out there is is the browser

646
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,120
updates and again people when they're

647
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,679
working at home it's not as easy to

648
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,919
walk over to your peers and say like hey

649
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:38,880
um

650
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,039
is this legit or did this did you get

651
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,480

updates to these things um

654
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,039
it's hard to know so and then also again

655
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,840
being distracted people are just

656
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,520
not paying as much attention because

657
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,280
it's like hey i'm just doing some stuff

658
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,559
doing some other stuff just clicking

659
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,200
around you know not a lot of people have

660
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,720
often it pops up they don't even think

661
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,960
about it they click yes updated shirt

662
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,000
um

663
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,919
but anyway good choice

664
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,480
one more all right so antivirus update

665
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,960

666
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,960
now he's getting towards the end of his

667
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,840
time here at the house um but yeah oh

668
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,440
shoot another pop-up antivirus so he

669
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,559
didn't remember seeing an email this

670
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,200
time from from it saying that you know

671
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,159
all applications need to be updated um

672
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,440
don't don't sit on updates so again

673
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,240
should he hit yes or no yes

674
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,480
one two three four five six seven knows

675
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,840
one two three four five oh pretty close

676
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,559
so yes who's got it this time good

677
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,919
this time it wasn't the biggest

678
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,679
difference here you know one was a

679
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,720
pop-up via browser um

680
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,480
and which ship can obviously be avoided

681
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,720
you know if you have like an ad block um

682
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,400
in this case his actual application

683
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,960
pushed this update um but you know we'll

684
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,039
uh get into some interesting tidbits

685
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,679
about that in the near future as well

686
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:00,799
so

687
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,600
you know uh oh yeah fun facts here so

688
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,919
you know a big thing about why why is

689
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,080
you know again it could be preaching uh

690
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,559
pictures of choir here but why update

691
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,200
your applications um you know the

692
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,320
vendors will push out these

693
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,760
vulnerabilities the patches for

694
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,320
vulnerabilities um then put you know end

695
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,640
while pushing out the update but what we

696
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,520
found is actually that within a week um

697
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,960
attackers are able to weaponize their

698
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,760
vulnerabilities and push that out to the

699
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,280
public so

700
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,720
you know unless you're updating within

701
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,760
that week

702
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,679
it's um you're leaving your systems

703
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,120
vulnerable um that's what happened with

704
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,480
the assembly in breach for their their

705
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,559
file transfer you know something's like

706
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,480
hey we passed that problem also we're

707
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,960
sun setting this application but you

708
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,720
know people were like nah i think i'm

709
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,080
good like who attacks santos anyway um

710
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,360
obviously a major issue so um

711
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,600
yeah so and it's also like it's not

712
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,760
expensive right there's usually millions

713
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,960
of dollars to

714
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,480
to um

715
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,960
to build a zero day exploit but if the

716
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,200
vendor's pushing you the vulnerability

717
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,880
that's that's free for them right they

718
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,640
have the vulnerability they have the

719
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,400
target like all they have to do is build

720
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,039
the thing um and now people are able to

721
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,720
build a thing in less than a week so

722
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,760
that's why

723
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,840
on that end that's important

724
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,159
so

725
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,720
we have the time so where should we go

726
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,240
into the office this time we're calling

727
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,279
actually no we're gonna go to a coffee

728
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,200
shop because we have the time

729
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,320
um

730
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,640
overwritten

731
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,480
there we go coffee shop it's almond

732
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,039
because they appear he would so yeah

733
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,360
he's busy he's he's had he's changed he

734
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,520
actually took a shower today uh got to

735
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,200
the coffee shop he sat down it's

736
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,039
actually like super crowded hybrid work

737
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,200
is ramping up people are a lot more

738
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,880
comfortable being in public

739
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,799
um so you know he

740
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,600
finds his seat barely um

741
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,840
but yeah connects to the local wi-fi at

742
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,679
the coffee shop uh it's password

743
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,120
protected but the password is also

744
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,640
written on the block on the chalkboard

745
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,480
so you know it's not like super password

746
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,200
protected um here we go so first

747
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,679
decision you know let's get to work

748
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,520
he doesn't have anything he needs to be

749
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,960
on the vpn for

750
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,799
but or at least on the corporate network

751
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:09,760
he doesn't need to be on the corporate

752
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,440
network everything he needs to work on

753
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,960
can just be access you know commercial

754
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,000
cloud um so doesn't need the vpn should

755
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,440
he do it yes or no yes one two three

756
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,000
four five six seven eight knows

757
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,159
one

758
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:25,520
oops

759
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,320
yeah so doesn't hurt you know it might

760
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,840
it might slow them down though so one of

761
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,240
the things that again there's uh

762
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,320
always trade-offs and i'm sure your

763
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,960
organizations as everyone went remote

764
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,480
everyone started vpn and you started

765
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,919
seeing some issues so if if offering a

766
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,559
vpn is one of the big you know security

767
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,080
options you're doing for individuals

768
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,080
like if there's a throughput issue

769
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,679
they're going to not do it because again

770
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,000
he can actually do work without the vpn

771
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,840
um but it's most important again to kind

772
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,640
of

773
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,320
you know it's training people to make

774
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,400
that kind of a default habit for them

775
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,760
but if anything gets in their way um

776
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,760
that can cause issues and if it's a

777
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,640
single

778
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,919
factor gateway um like i said vpn credit

779
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,520
masquerading is like actually getting

780
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,840
big and that's like a direct remote

781
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,240
access into your network obviously so

782
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,480
um

783
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:17,679
all right

784
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,080
it's all the time um

785
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,400
but uh yeah so that definitely was

786
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,679
something to consider so

787
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:26,559
things are going to get a little

788
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,440
different now and

789
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,760
we're going to roll to see whether or

790
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,679
not someone steals his laptop

791
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,159
and so what happens is you know he's not

792
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,000
a lot of coffee at this point he needs

793
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,080
to use the bathroom and

794
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,360
he's working he's not working with

795
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,279
anyone he's by himself a lot of people

796
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,799
in the shop but you know he's going to

797
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,799
get up he's going to use the restroom

798
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,960
you know the computer's locked is just

799
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,039
leaving the computer there by itself and

800
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,240
the reason why i'm not going to do yes

801
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,080
or no here because i know

802
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,360
everyone knows

803
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,080
the answer is don't do that but

804
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,919
the reason why this is happening like

805
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,000
this is because last sunday i was at a

806
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,240
coffee shop just you know they were

807
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,440
doing some work

808
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,720
um

809
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,799
and i'm sitting there and i'm just doing

810
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,240
drinking my coffee doing my work i look

811
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,480
up i see a laptop someone's working on a

812
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,640
laptop and it is it's a very

813
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,640
you know that clunky work laptop look

814
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,000
it's like it's like this could be a

815
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,480
government laptop or it could be like uh

816
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,960
maybe like a big big company is kind of

817
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,039
like an out-of-date kind of laptop it's

818
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,799
a little calculator built into it so

819
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,720
like most likely their work or

820
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,120
government um you know go back to do my

821
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:31,919
work

822
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,080
look up again and i see that they have a

823
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,799
second laptop even older even chunkier

824
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,559
and this time with a cat sticking out so

825
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,960
i was like clearly like either governor

826
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,000
or consultant or something for the

827
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,600
government also this coffee shop was

828
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,720
across the street from the darpa

829
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,559
headquarters so it's like high chance

830
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:47,279
that

831
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,559
there's some sort of government work

832
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,480
happening here and also high chance that

833
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,120
there's someone out here looking to

834
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,679
exploit something so yeah and then so i

835
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:56,720
was like all right cool you know you got

836
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,520
your gopro laptops working good for you

837
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,320
um

838
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,880
and they got up and they got up four

839
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,919
times

840
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,200
and i was

841
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,399
sitting there like

842
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,640
sticking out a laptop laptop sitting

843
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,480
there back full of things i was like oh

844
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,720
my gosh like i

845
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,159
i always thought this was a silly thing

846
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,760
they're like you know all the laptops

847
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,600
get stolen or whatever like that's a big

848
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,960
security issue you know we need to make

849
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,200
sure our hard drives are locked down um

850
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,760
but i witnessed myself somebody who just

851
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,039
really had

852
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:25,919
no

853
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,600
no care in the world about what happens

854
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,080
to their hardware so because of that

855
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,520
we're running this we're running this

856
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,159
three times owen has three chances to

857
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,399
get his laptop stolen and what we're

858
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,200
gonna do is i brought this this d6 here

859
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,640
um

860
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,000
we have to pick a number if it lands on

861
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,919
that number it gets laptop stolen so

862
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,600
first number who wants one through six

863
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,080
somebody pick five five

864
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,879
here we go

865
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,200
one he made it second number

866
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,760
three three

867
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,399
two

868
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,880
oh he's getting lucky

869
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,880
you know we're in a casino right so we

870
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,720
have to bring out some sort of

871
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,039
uh gambling aspect all right last number

872
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,480
what do we got

873
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,799
four

874
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,960
one he made it congratulations he's just

875
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,480
really leaving his hardware out there

876
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,640
work and personal laptop but he made it

877
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,919
out okay

878
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,279
um

879
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:24,640
so miss no loss but not a great habit

880
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,039
um yeah like i said honestly blew my

881
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,200
mind i was sitting there like this was

882
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,200
awful like

883
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,399
someone could have walked off of that i

884
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,880
wasn't gonna do it but um

885
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,320
but that being said you gotta really you

886
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,000
gotta build this in right like this is a

887
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,559
reality out there people are doing this

888
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,320
um this needs to be part of the strategy

889
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,520
like when you're building out your cyber

890
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,000
security um strategies like know that

891
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,320
people are doing some stupid things and

892
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,000
doing some risky things because they

893
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,440
don't believe they're gonna be the one

894
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,880
right so it's like hey

895
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,799
i'm not gonna like this i come to this

896
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,559
coffee shop all the time you know these

897
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,000
look like all nice people all

898
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,600
professionals no one's gonna steal my

899
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,520
laptop no one's gonna try to do anything

900
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,440
bad but

901
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,600
i mean like i said of the places that

902
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,279
someone's probably lurking around like

903
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,960
being across the street from darpa is

904
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,960
probably there

905
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,080
um

906
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,600
all right so

907
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,360
uh because of that you know we're

908
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,279
actually i should have said home but you

909
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,720
know we're gonna again go straight here

910
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,440
to the office um yeah you know to be

911
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,120
honest he came for the snacks don't we

912
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,360
all uh also to be honest he just

913
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,559
straight up doesn't have a printer in

914
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,919
his house so he needs to print papers

915
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,159
out of the office um again totally

916
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,799
reality what's happening now um but yeah

917
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,159
so he you know he's he's taking his

918
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,080
laptop all around he's had a lot of fun

919
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,760
it's time to just hook right into the

920
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,480
corporate network um and unfortunately

921
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,799
because of the way they've run their

922
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,720
stuff is there as long as you've been

923
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,480
authenticated before that's all you need

924
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,799
to do that device is authenticated again

925
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,000
um

926
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,440
so he's good to go

927
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,279
so you know this is the end of the

928
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,840
scenario here so after math um you guys

929
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,960
made it through right so he didn't get

930
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,120
compromised otherwise you know they

931
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,039
would have harvested some vpn creds they

932
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,960
would have um you know they're only

933
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,480
using a single factor gateway they would

934
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,720
use print nightmare to print best and

935
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,559
eventually work their way to a dev

936
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,679
network

937
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,399
where they're going to push some very

938
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:16,640
suspicious looking code to the repo

939
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,960
but you guys made it up we made it up

940
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,320
today so you successfully worked a

941
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,919
single day without getting compromised

942
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,159
congratulations um hopefully the same is

943
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,720
true for all those peers so

944
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,080
you know uh one thing about you know

945
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,519
what we just went through is like

946
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:30,799
obviously nothing was like too

947
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,720
mind-blowing there but

948
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,799
it is a good a good method in addition

949
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,640
to just regular user training like

950
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,640
having some sort of narrative again i'm

951
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,120
sure you all know but um the more that

952
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,640
we need to push responsibility on the

953
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,640
individuals the more we need to just be

954
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,039
entertaining some the narrative is the

955
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,159
number one

956
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,600
way people remember

957
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,880
um

958
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,799
does anyone remember owen's first name

959
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,120
that starts with the p

960
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,039
pinkney yeah sorry it's a really random

961
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,240
detail but hey

962
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,519
you remember it probably remember

963
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,960
exactly the whole story chain we went

964
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,640
through and some of the weird details

965
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,640
that we did um

966
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,399
but you know it wouldn't be a good story

967
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,360
if we didn't have a twist so

968
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,640
the twist

969
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,720
uh so yeah sophomore solutions core is

970
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,880
actually one of your vendors

971
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,159
and so if that got compromised on that

972
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,640
side that code got pushed software

973
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,399
solutions core just pushed an update

974
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,080
your rit said staff says you know

975
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,720
they're a verified legitimate vendor

976
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,480
they need an update i just told you that

977
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,399
weaponization happens within a week you

978
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,480
know let's get this application updated

979
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,279
but

980
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,159
if

981
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,720
if owen got compromised if they got onto

982
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,080
that dev network if they pushed a

983
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,600
backdoor that just got legitimately

984
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,519
verified to their

985
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,919
you know cicd process

986
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,399
then what do you do right so the growing

987
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,080
growing supply chain attacks is another

988
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,840
reason why we need to take

989
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,440
the concept of a perimeter and bring it

990
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,600
down to as granular as possible because

991
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,360
that's a legitimate company selling

992
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,600
legitimate software that got compromised

993
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,760
that you can't how do you track you know

994
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,360
your own not just your own security but

995
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,120
security after security like down the

996
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,120
chain and the only way to do that again

997
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,799
this massive attack surface the only way

998
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,960
to do that is to focus on what's most

999
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,679
important to the organization secure

1000
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,200
that and then work your way up from

1001
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,480
there

1002
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,559
so i really appreciate you guys watching

1003
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,919
the presentation that's everything we

1004
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:18,960
got

1005
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,399
feel free to contact me if you want

1006
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:23,919
if you didn't like it roast me on

1007
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,760
twitter if you did like it

1008
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,919
feel free to roast me on twitter um but

1009
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,880
yeah any questions

1010
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,919
yes

1011
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,080
so the question was that uh in his

1012
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,159
organizations your trust is difficult to

1013
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:48,880
do

1014
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,919
um

1015
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,600
the paragraph with you know compromised

1016
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,320
is there a is the last part a partial

1017
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,519
zero trust

1018
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,640
so zero trust is you know is in general

1019
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,039
just like an architecture concept um so

1020
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,440
in a way you know there isn't like a you

1021
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,720
can't go out and buy zero trust

1022
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,440
obviously but to your point you know we

1023
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,159
need to it's really an ongoing process

1024
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,000
of getting more and more

1025
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,119
um secure via that method so you know

1026
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,199
what it could look like today so let's

1027
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,280
say your organization has one large

1028
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,040
network that they have secured via

1029
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,679
traditional methods um you don't have to

1030
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,679
go all the way to securing every piece

1031
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,079
of data right so that zero trust can be

1032
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,000
a process so it goes from hey we got one

1033
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,800
big network um maybe five networks that

1034
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,199
are segmented based off of user roles

1035
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,639
right so we've got dev network now

1036
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,079
business network so that way if there's

1037
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,320
a compromise um

1038
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,918
you know it's harder to traverse from

1039
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,119
network to networks at the end of the

1040
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,199
day also zero trust is

1041
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,879
taking the concept it used to be that

1042
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,359
like cyber security was hey let's keep

1043
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,679
the hackers out let's keep attackers out

1044
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,239
um and that's the goal but what we're

1045
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,918
seeing is that you know you can't make

1046
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,000
that assumption anymore like networks

1047
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,839
are compromised all the time people are

1048
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:01,839
selling threads all the time insider

1049
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,200
threats happening as well and that's

1050
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,000
even

1051
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,599
entirely different than the whole actual

1052
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,000
attack piece um so if you're assuming

1053
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,680
that your network's compromised then

1054
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,280
it's like what do you do after that and

1055
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,040
that's what zero trust is all about so

1056
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,160
they're saying like assume that

1057
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,760
network's compromised how do we make it

1058
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,680
difficult for an attacker to achieve

1059
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,520
their in-state goal because usually

1060
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,599
getting on the first box isn't the goal

1061
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,200
even pre-investing on the first box

1062
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,680
isn't the goal but you know it's usually

1063
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,599
traversed to certain networks you know

1064
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,440
either it's going to be to

1065
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,200
maybe they want to install some spyware

1066
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,040
on exchange server that's pretty hot

1067
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,040
right now right so maybe they'll do that

1068
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,480
maybe they you know want to push some

1069
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,599
code to

1070
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,320
um to the code repo maybe

1071
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,000
you know they want to just like break

1072
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,800
everything all at once um but either way

1073
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,599
um again as we all know hacking isn't an

1074
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,119
instant thing it isn't just like let me

1075
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,200
just go ahead google right now all right

1076
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,960
it's like it's a long process right it

1077
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,800
takes a you know a number of months

1078
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,119
usually for a good campaign um and what

1079
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,720
that means is when we hear about these

1080
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,480
effects that means those attackers have

1081
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,320
been in there for months uh and

1082
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,920
oftentimes multiple different parties

1083
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,480
are in there at once so um

1084
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,680
and so that's always fun to try and

1085
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,839
defense like that but um

1086
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,680
it's not being said like you if you

1087
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,760
assume that they're already in how do we

1088
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,760
fix that and that's that's making sure

1089
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,800
that

1090
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,320
they think about their unstable think

1091
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,920
about what is the objective of the

1092
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,240
attacker how do i make it hard if they

1093
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,760
if they already have a hook in how do i

1094
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,760
make it hard to get there and again you

1095
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,040
know a lot of segmentation and i'm

1096
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,200
saying that like we need to go beyond

1097
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,599
network segmentation down to even like i

1098
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,839
did identification per day

1099
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,480
um yeah

1100
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,599
thanks for the question anyone else

1101
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,960
all right well i really appreciate

1102
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,720
uh coming to the talk and that's

1103
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,160
everything feel free to talk to me if

1104
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,440
you have any more questions afterwards

1105
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,440
thanks
