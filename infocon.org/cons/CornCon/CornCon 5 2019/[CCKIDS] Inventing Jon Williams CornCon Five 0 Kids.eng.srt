1
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:19,250
so I'm John Williams I am NOT talking

2
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:23,910
about my careers day well I am in a

3
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:27,990
security role I have been doing computer

4
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:32,689
security and post security for one years

5
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:35,460
or so and a variety of really fun topics

6
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:40,290
I'm currently working on Internet of

7
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:45,500
Things Stata ot I've done what they call

8
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:48,180
Incident Response so if a hacker gets in

9
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,920
somebody needs to figure out what

10
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,960
happened where did it happen what's

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,530
being affected how do we deal with it

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,550
and recover if publicity gets out we

13
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,800
need to coordinate with the

14
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,709
communications office to make sure that

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,199
they're saying the right things I also

16
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,950
did computer forensics for about a

17
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:09,630
decade and basically what happened there

18
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,450
is you know if somebody did something

19
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,810
bad on the inside we needed we think we

20
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:19,470
know that they did it they did computer

21
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:23,130
hard drive out and then kind of like the

22
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:26,158
NCIS or CSI I would go through another

23
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:29,539
little evidence whether they did or did

24
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,540
not do

25
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:40,429
I am one of the cofounders of corn con I

26
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:42,350
am the founder and it was the the head

27
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:45,590
of the children of the corn cotton for

28
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:47,449
the first three years the last couple of

29
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:51,920
years I've had to step down for a while

30
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:55,759
due to some health issues I am really

31
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,819
enthusiastic about education and helping

32
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,759
kids learn stuff because as JD was

33
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:03,860
saying we have negative unemployment and

34
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,520
your parents know that that means even

35
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:09,919
if you don't we need jobs to be filled

36
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,760
and the best way that we can do this is

37
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:17,119
we still start the talent pipeline early

38
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:20,390
you guys and so I really really believe

39
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,750
in this so likewise if you've got

40
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:25,819
questions and you see me around today

41
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:30,620
feel free to stop me ask me whatever you

42
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:34,518
want and I will try to answer now having

43
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:38,560
said all that today I'm going to talk

44
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:42,130
about inventing and basically it's easy

45
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,130
except when it's not

46
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,240
so just to make sure you guys are

47
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:51,050
engaged

48
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:54,040
what is inventing anybody want to give

49
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:54,040
me a go-ahead

50
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:10,870
okay I'm gonna calling you later is your

51
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:10,870
might get anybody else got any ideas

52
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,080
okay seeing a trend here we definitely

53
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,750
think that inventing involves something

54
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:33,010
new

55
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:33,010
any other ideas not yours

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:46,640
anything else we agree we disagree we're

57
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:50,329
awake okay so yes inventing is

58
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:54,700
definitely creating something new I'll

59
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:57,440
get later on to the helping the world

60
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,869
inventing is creating something creating

61
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:03,769
or designing something that's not been

62
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:05,959
done before preferably it would be not

63
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:08,030
just copying something because again the

64
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:14,299
idea is you're doing something that is

65
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:18,620
new and there are lots of things that

66
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:22,010
are inventions there is nothing in this

67
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:25,610
room besides people that was not

68
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:28,580
invented and sometimes we're so used to

69
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:34,640
it that it's hard to think that this

70
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:36,700
table is an invention so next

71
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,620
interactive bed

72
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,990
how about inventions what's your

73
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,520
favorite invention and this time I make

74
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:46,660
you go around through what's your

75
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,659
favorite thing that's going

00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:24,799
[Music]

81
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:27,920
appreciated your didn't like the hard

82
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:37,700

88
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,239
I forgot to get back to you what is your

89
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,940
answer

90
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:01,479
now that I didn't I would say there are

91
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:03,610
good and bad ones of inventing like

92
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:06,669
people have been going about electronics

93
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:13,680
cars comfy chairs but there are also bad

94
00:06:06,669 --> 00:07:06,340
things for example a nuclear bomb was

95
00:06:13,680 --> 00:07:08,820
not yep okay potentially even more so

96
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:12,659
because with a gun I get to that person

97
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,659
with computers

98
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:27,640
and you can also make sure wash off the

99
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:31,000
power to a hospital yes do you guys know

100
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:35,380
that there's actually more profitable in

101
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,050
a bad way to do cybercrime and it is to

102
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:42,100
use a gun to rob a bank today that your

103
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:46,180
crime occurs in the cyber world than in

104
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:50,530
the physical world and it's interesting

105
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:54,040
how crime has changed due to technology

106
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:55,239
and this is a not-so-subtle plug my boy

107
00:07:54,040 --> 00:08:01,540
is actually going to talk about an

108
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:02,890
aspect of that it is alright so didn't

109
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,130
realize you were back there so how about

110
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,130
you

111
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:13,470
have you tried in the other room yeah

112
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:23,950
yeah there she got even better than that

113
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:32,460
they got beat yeah it's a rhythm game

114
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:36,750
like I had the block to insert direction

115
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,750
y'all are gonna have to fight me off cuz

116
00:08:41,250 --> 00:09:02,700
alright so how about you what's your

117
00:08:44,380 --> 00:09:02,700
favorite okay yeah all right

118
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:37,399
never change my plans and like amazing

119
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:41,508
stuff oh so it's the pump thing not

120
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:44,120
really no it actually goes around the

121
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:46,269
body and it just we didn't know this

122
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,269
existed

123
00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:56,959
so you don't have to remember this song

124
00:09:48,889 --> 00:10:00,740
stayin alive playing you know complains

125
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:04,699
to spaceship there's a lot and that's a

126
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:09,009
good one I love traveling by like road

127
00:10:04,699 --> 00:10:09,008
trips yeah road trips for another

128
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,040
scientist

129

maglev and vacuum tubes yes this is Elon

130
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:44,209
Musk and amusingly were named the

131
00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:47,868
company the boring one of the guys so in

132
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:49,609
addition to this day yesterday we had a

133
00:10:47,869 --> 00:10:52,519
part of this conference that was just

134
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:54,350
for the adults and it generally targeted

135
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:57,619
people who are in the profession and

136
00:10:54,350 --> 00:11:00,009
then that was part of our educational

137
00:10:57,619 --> 00:11:02,749
outreach for high school students and

138
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:08,239
one of the guys that I was working with

139
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:11,179
on Wednesday Thursday said that he's

140
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:17,149
trying to figure out how to be allowed

141
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:19,488
to bring his it's not a not a blank door

142
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:25,669
because he's got one of the Alliance

143
00:11:19,489 --> 00:11:28,189
Blanco and on YouTube there was just

144
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:30,379
recently a video of somebody using one

145
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:34,009
of those flamethrowers and another guy

146
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:37,699
standing behind a shield of aerogel and

147
00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:39,439
aerogel is awesome stuff it's yes and

148
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:44,049
it's got an amazing heat properties and

149
00:11:39,439 --> 00:11:47,169
didn't mention any other adults have a

150
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:50,209
I'm gonna go laughs I've got one okay I

151
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:53,329
guess mine would be as kind of cliche

152
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:57,279
but the Internet itself well now it has

153
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:57,279
to do something yes

154
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,819
so it's not really a big thing but like

155
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:26,649
delightfully like like I always have

156
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:36,470
this quote mind when I ever like I think

157
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:43,399
I feel like 99 times creating yeah I

158
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:45,639
like Edison to so props like Chris for

159
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:45,639
anything

160
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:58,639
[Music]

161
00:12:49,209 --> 00:13:00,979
oh yeah the Asian pears so in the

162
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:05,600
interesting like yeah take the whole

163
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:13,569
time my favorite invention the rubber

164
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:19,730
o-ring ice cream is inferior to July

165
00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:33,618
gelato is much superior much better

166
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:38,529
texture really a flavor so the rubber

167
00:13:33,619 --> 00:13:42,499
o-ring these things mark everywhere

168
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:44,410
they're in military aircraft they're in

169
00:13:42,499 --> 00:13:48,110
spacecraft they're in the launch

170
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:51,379
platforms for the spacecraft they are in

171
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:57,490
your cars every car that you came in

172
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:57,490
today as though reason they are in I

173
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:04,370
who sings you like bill box and the

174
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:09,280
waterproof ones have a reason the

175
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:09,280
flashlights got one there

176
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:16,640
they're infused everywhere but the thing

177
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:19,729
that makes me so excited about them is

178
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:23,420
the fact that they have three critical

179
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:25,760
dimensions the distance from one side

180
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:28,550
together on the inside of your ring the

181
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:32,450
same distance from the outside across it

182
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:45,650
and then similar distance of the they

183
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:51,080
put a cross-section demonstration okay

184
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:54,170
oh oh so one of the dimensions is across

185
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:58,010
here one of them is across here and then

186
00:14:54,170 --> 00:15:00,349
the other one is across here when they

187
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:03,710
manufacture opens particularly the ones

188
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:08,830
for automobile motorcycles

189
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:11,510
we're water proof is important the

190
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:15,400
tolerances when they produce those are

191
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:19,150
within like a thousandth of an inch and

192
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:22,760
when they produce them at that level of

193
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:25,670
accuracy and repeatability they still

194
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:28,730
sell them I was looking on Amazon this

195
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:30,620
morning you can buy 200 of them for 10

196
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:33,760
bucks sorry John

197
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,760
Yeti makes the selling product

198
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:46,100
so lots of good ideas in here cars

199
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:48,320
obviously and the thing is is that cars

200
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,690
are an invention but everything in the

201
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:54,560
car is also an adventure yeah so the car

202
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:57,860
door is the seats the material on the

203
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:00,550
seats the wires that go for the

204
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:05,660
electronics the electronics themselves

205
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:06,920
not the wheel it's been around for so

206
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:10,549
long nobody thinks about

207
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,299
but the wheel is tens of thousands of

208
00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:13,279
years old

209
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:15,290
but it was an adventure and it was a

210
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,839
revolutionary invention there are very

211
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:21,639
very few inventions that have lasted in

212
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,419
the same basic form for so long

213
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:28,549
another one that people don't always

214
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:33,399
think about Arielle's barbie is an

215
00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:33,399
invention very successful invention

216
00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:39,679
nobody knows what that means

217
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:44,779
that's my adventure I actually presented

218
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:47,629
on this last year that is everybody know

219
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:51,379
that dice are anybody know about thumbs

220
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:53,629
in their audience okay so you've done

221
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:56,480
the Dragons they have not just the

222
00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:59,149
regular dice that you recognize they

223
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,829
have seven like different dice that have

224
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:05,470
different numbers of science they've got

225
00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:08,599
four six eight ten twelve twenty and

226
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:12,709
sometimes they do 100 and sometimes it's

227
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:14,388
two tens eight that's the challenge that

228
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:16,100
everything into it was I wanted to do

229
00:17:14,388 --> 00:17:18,198
done some the Dragons again because my

230
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:21,168
boy is old enough now he wants

231
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:24,199
introductions dragons but there are

232
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:26,059
basically three categories of dice when

233
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:28,760
you're getting a full set there's the

234
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:30,620
stuff that's cheap there's the stuff

235
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,769
that it's relatively cheap it looks good

236
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:39,189
and there's this stuff that is not cheap

237
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:41,389
but also the first two are not random

238
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:43,960
because I have cheap there they've got

239
00:17:41,389 --> 00:17:47,029
internal voids they've got you know

240
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:49,700
casting marks around the outside so they

241
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:52,580
are biased to particularly numbers and

242
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:54,980
because I'm a geek and I said study

243
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:57,529
security and randomness is really

244
00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:00,110
important security I wanted really ran

245
00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:03,559
the dice but I didn't want to spend what

246
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:06,709
it costs to get a good set of really

247
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:10,010
random dice basically the best one

248
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:13,700
a lot of really cool you get the

249
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:15,529
Technium ones but those are solid on the

250
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,659
insider machine need to really tight

251
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:20,779
tolerances and they're like 80 to 100

252
00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:25,820
bucks for a set of seven didn't Iseman

253
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:28,460
so they develop that and it's another

254
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,720
one of these things everything that

255
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:33,200
you're looking at there is in the

256
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:35,270
mentioned and so I produced this for

257
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,970
myself and it's out buttons on you it's

258
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:39,679
like ditch dice you want to roll and how

259
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:47,289
many of them you are and you hit the

260
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:54,020
button it will give you another that is

261
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:59,500
my son dimension again his was not quite

262
00:18:54,020 --> 00:19:02,240
as serious and idea he wanted to have

263
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:06,380
something cool for his Valentine's box

264
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:10,370
that's cool and so we talked about this

265
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:13,720
and he wanted to do the original was he

266
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:18,399
wanted to have something to count the

267
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:21,020
billy bike that he wanted to count on

268
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:22,939
Valentine's and then we had in the

269
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:28,750
future where is going to like say thank

270
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:28,750
you or something but that's Alex's

271
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:40,549
inventors all right so anyway this is

272
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:43,639
Thomas Edison very prolific he had at

273
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:46,610
the time of his death over a thousand

274
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:51,230
patents things that he had invented and

275
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:53,689
they were actually new things enough

276
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:57,440
that the government certified that this

277
00:19:53,690 --> 00:20:00,279
is new and they given a monopoly for

278
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,320
seventeen years or something

279
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:05,059
this guy is equally important but less

280
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,480
well known to you guys this is Tim

281
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:10,990
berners-lee he is the inventor of the

282
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,990
World Wide Web

283
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:21,190
yep she's famous but not for this reason

284
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:24,310
that is Hedy Lamarr she was an actress

285
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:26,500
in a bunch of very popular movies what

286
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:30,399
people don't tend to know about her is

287
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:34,090
that during World War two she invented

288
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:37,210
something called frequency hopping

289
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:40,840
spread spectrum this was a military

290
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:42,430
thing originally and the idea was they

291
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,790
were going to use this in order to

292
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:48,820
combat enemy jamming of the radios and

293
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:50,770
the way that she did this was instead of

294
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,740
broadcasting on one specific frequency

295
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:55,210
which you know if you do that the enemy

296
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,610
can come up they can broadcast louder

297
00:20:55,210 --> 00:21:01,420
into making here so what she said it was

298
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:04,540
let's broadcast for a little bit on this

299
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:06,310
channel this channel hop back and forth

300
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:08,020
across and so they don't know when

301
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:10,690
you're broadcasting on which channel and

302
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:15,220
it's a bunch of them so they can block

303
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:17,200
them and it's a really important thing

304
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:22,270
and it's still used in forms today

305
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:24,580
Bluetooth uses a form of this so very

306
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:27,840
important and it was it was actually a

307
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,840
very critical thing for the war effort

308
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:35,600
there's two guys here don't care about

309
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:39,770
the diagonal on the right piece

310
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:47,389
guy on the left is reward is ralph baer

311
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:47,389
he was the inventor of video games yeah

312
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:58,090
probably not very much this is Annie

313
00:21:53,080 --> 00:22:03,309
Malone she was yeah very frequently

314
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:05,949
she was an inventor a line of cosmetics

315
00:22:03,309 --> 00:22:10,029
and hair products or african-american

316
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:12,519
women and she did this at around the

317
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:15,610
turn of the century maybe and weighted

318
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:18,610
the clothes maybe into the 20s and so

319
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:21,428
this is the time where women weren't

320
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:23,860
really doing it better particularly not

321
00:22:21,429 --> 00:22:27,159
african-american women so there was a

322
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:29,860
huge amount of courage involved in her

323
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:33,190
innovations and running a business and

324
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:37,449
at time I believe I read that she ended

325
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:45,700
up in wealthiest african-american women

326
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:47,529
in the country and I'm gonna apologize I

327
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,389
struggle of this guy's name this is

328
00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:54,070
Praveen Kumar

329
00:22:49,389 --> 00:22:56,168
barkhaa and amongst a whole bunch of

330
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:59,860
other things that he's invented he

331
00:22:56,169 --> 00:23:02,139
invented a low-cost typewriter for the

332
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:06,340
blind so it would do it would take the

333
00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:08,199
Braille and they had them but they were

334
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:10,949
all expensive and he came up with a

335
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,950
design that

336
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:25,840
yeah hey supposedly only had 15 minutes

337
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:26,590
I so I'm gonna go through the rest of

338
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,418
this real quick

339
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:30,070
and again if you've got questions after

340
00:23:28,419 --> 00:23:33,220
this

341
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:36,280
so why team inventors in men some of

342
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:37,500
them in member fun it's cool I enjoy

343
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,668
doing this

344
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:44,620
someone we do it out of curiosity I

345
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:46,720
wonder how this works my case it was

346
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:48,399
necessity I wanted to do this there

347
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,299
wasn't something else out there that

348
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:55,059
would do it so I made this up there are

349
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:59,980
people who invent for companies their

350
00:23:55,059 --> 00:24:07,629
job is to invent and I had a co-worker

351
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:11,620
and that I would have loved his job is

352
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:20,549
to invent and then there's folks anybody

353
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:23,860
know who this is you know this is yeah

354
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:26,860
some people do it because they're good

355
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:29,260
at inventing and instead of working for

356
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:31,649
somebody else making money for somebody

357
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:33,850
else they may not do themselves

358
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:36,100
quick through the amendment process the

359
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:39,209
first bit is what they call ideation

360
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:42,280
come over than I get I love this quote

361
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:47,200
the best way to have good ideas is to

362
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:49,750
have lots of ideas a good analogy to

363
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:53,200
that is in the professional photography

364
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:54,040
space the good photographers get one

365
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,000
good picture

366
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:58,840
for about every 210 that they take and

367
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,350
those are the people who are

368
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,820
professionals who do this over the years

369
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:07,760
the next thing you need to analyze your

370
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:10,168
items is it possible is it practical

371
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:13,129
what's the cost will need to be how

372
00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:18,529
long's it gonna take and then you built

373
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:18,529
do you know whatever the first thing is

374
00:25:18,649 --> 00:25:29,639
and then you do it over until you get it

375
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:33,179
as straight as it needs to be things

376
00:25:29,639 --> 00:25:36,600
considered most importantly know

377
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:41,549
yourself know what you want out of

378
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:43,230
inventing know what this the orders are

379
00:25:41,549 --> 00:25:44,309
of what you're going to invent how much

380
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:46,889
money you want to spend how much time

381
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:49,370
they got it know if you need to have

382
00:25:46,889 --> 00:25:49,370
somebody else

383
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:55,790
sometimes you need to pay attention to

384
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:59,090
make sure you don't make something

385
00:25:55,790 --> 00:26:04,639
that's too complex the very popular KISS

386
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:06,260
principle keep it simple stupid we were

387
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,960
talking about the Edison quote I

388
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:11,150
actually wired this way I went back and

389
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,410
research to find out what the actual

390
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:15,230
book was because I saw a lot of

391
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:19,760
different versions but Edison said was I

392
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:24,640
have gotten a lot of results I know

393
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:28,160
several thousand things that won't work

394
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,380
and this was in response to somebody it

395
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:35,480
said you know how does it feel to have

396
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:41,480
failed it was 700 times was the amount

397
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:45,680
and he says I didn't fail failure isn't

398
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:48,050
that failure is successfully proven that

399
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:51,710
this thing won't work then you move on

400
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:54,889
to the next one until you find one yes

401
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:58,160
and you can't learn without failure now

402
00:26:54,890 --> 00:27:01,010
you thought my kids is learn from your

403
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:03,460
own failure that's good learning from

404
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:08,030
somebody else's failure is even better

405
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:10,400
you don't have to make your own mistakes

406
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:13,220
think about your audience if you're

407
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,110
inventing just for yourself you can

408
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:16,490
spend what you want at a time you want

409
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:19,159
you don't have to worry about release

410
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:20,240
dates if you're inventing your friends

411
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,500
then you have to start thinking about

412
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,300
what do they want

413
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:25,640
how many problems are they going to put

414
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:28,340
up with but if you're inventing for

415
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:30,950
selling then you have price points you

416
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:33,919
have state do you have security you have

417
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:35,870
reliability you have warranty claims you

418
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:39,100
have to make sure that what you invent

419
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:42,489
it wasn't invented by somebody else and

420
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:45,939
because they need to get out sometime

421
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:45,940
I'll take questions

422
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:52,070
thank you very much thank you I

423
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,070
appreciate your coming
