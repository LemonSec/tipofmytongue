1
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,359
good afternoon everybody jonathan

2
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:30,720
Greenert arts them the couple things

3
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,700
about me I am actually look so I got to

4
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,100
sleep in my own bed this morning and

5
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,920
last night so can't complain about that

6
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,120
right so it is very appreciative when

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,280
you get to come to something like this

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,129
as John said yesterday you don't have to

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,320
baby Chicago it's nice to have something

10
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:47,849
here local in the Quad Cities so I've

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,039
been with our seven seven years as of

12
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,620
yesterday actually I sit there are a

13
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,140
security privacy and risk practice where

14
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,320
we focus on a number of different things

15
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,180
but the number one is cyber security if

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,370
you've heard of the library arch them

17
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,580
used to be was like so a little

18
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,649
background on us we we are audit tax and

19
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,670
consulting with a focus on the industry

20
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,130
and then different regions of the

21
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:14,189
country you've got a whole bunch offices

22
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,750
throughout the United States and you can

23
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,360
see yeah I like to point out we have a

24
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,850
big cluster in Iowa so we are actually

25
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,820
founded in Iowa and we're still an Iowa

26
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,439
company so today what we're going to go

27
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,809
through are some of the current

28
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,548
landscapes that what we see are some we

29
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,490
serve the middle market so what that

30
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:35,369
means is revenues of under 50 billion

31
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,470
typically most of the time so this is

32
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:40,110
going to be very much customized to what

33
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,190
we see on a day to day basis as well as

34
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,100
some of these

35
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:45,870
stretch that below here in a little bit

36
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:48,030
we'll go through the top three things

37
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:51,480
that PC darts them and that all clients

38
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:54,840
are dealing with as well as some cyber

39
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,880
threat intelligence and shredding them

40
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,000
the light on the dark web is life so

41
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,960
whatever seemed out for different things

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
number one privacy security it's the hot

43
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,740
topic it's what's happened in 2019

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,830
that's what's different from a year ago

45
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,960
and we would have created online

46
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:15,480
business partners third plot third-party

47
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,640
risk management who's connecting in

48
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:22,019
who's connecting out who controls those

49
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:26,519
connections that word espionage people

50
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:28,320
inside the network either by an employee

51
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,930
or somebody that's in and pushing things

52
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,630
out that should be very simple stuff and

53
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,760
then the fourth one is regulators we're

54
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:40,400
gonna see here in a second the largest

55
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:43,530
stuff that as far as fines have gone in

56
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,610
history so in the United States there

57
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,860
are a lot of different things but

58
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,810
specifically in the news recently

59
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,520
Facebook you most of us have heard

60
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,350
Facebook might even have a Facebook

61
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:58,260
account or have some deleted it since

62
00:02:52,350 --> 00:03:00,930
you left college ton of money right some

63
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,700
money but what what that's no surprise

64
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,260
there for Facebook yeah it actually

65
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,720
might make an impact but for other folks

66
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,340
let's listen what does the real impact

67
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,550
how is this going to trickle down and

68
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:14,250
the way this trickles down is the next

69
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:16,769
one this is significant because what it

70
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:19,890
does is the FTC when they implemented

71
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:23,880
this this fine right here they did a few

72
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:25,440
things that FBI does a little bit but

73
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,760
you heard it in a couple different

74
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,430
speakers yesterday when we talk about

75
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,220
sea levels and board meeting training

76
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:34,680
and in cybersecurity and IT security

77
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,409
data privacy what happened here

78
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,530
is they made the CEO directly

79
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:44,489
responsible for the data privacy program

80
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:45,930
that is new that is specific to to

81
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:47,700
what's going on here and then the other

82
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:49,439
thing that they did and remember

83
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,480
Facebook is not in a regulated injury

84
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,939
industry like banking and healthcare for

85
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,010
example they also made third-party

86
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:57,959
Assessor requirement looking at the

87
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:02,810
systems because they have so much data

88
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:05,299
so from a significant standpoint

89
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:08,099
everybody's kind of used to the board or

90
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:10,920
the subcommittee being responsible for

91
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:15,119
cybersecurity or data privacy this added

92
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:18,180
additional layers of oversight in the

93
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,959
United States again we hear about things

94
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:25,020
that privacy IT security however it's

95
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:28,280
not new in the u.s. a lot of people just

96
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:31,049
don't think of it this way cybersecurity

97
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,739
HIPAA for example has been around since

98
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,810
96

99
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:37,050
2009 the security rules of London which

100
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,720
govern NT so in the u.s. IT security

101
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,490
data privacy although we talk about

102
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,650
regulating bodies it's not new in the

103
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:47,190
United States it's just been industry

104
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:48,780
specific gramm-leach-bliley that's going

105
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:52,050
to cover your banking institutions

106
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:55,080
that's going to cover your financial

107
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,460
institutions as well yes our banking

108
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,698
financial institutions it's going to

109
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:06,090
cover your educational institutions as

110
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:07,650
well PCI purple who knows what firm that

111
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:11,190
is without reading the slide is heard of

112
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:14,280
it before couple okay your universities

113
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:16,919
your elementary school your high schools

114
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,869
the data that they hold is actually

115
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:22,409
regulated they have to keep that data

116
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:24,240
security it is a federal law okay

117
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:29,220
and still around for a while so again

118
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:32,180
point is that this is nothing yeah going

119
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:36,240
on here and moving on why do we care

120
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:38,700
supply in the man we're protecting

121
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,430
things data privacy IT security for a

122
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:43,260
reason because we have those of you that

123
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,120
have taken economics understand that

124
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:47,580
when there's a demand or something

125
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,100
people want to pay for okay

126
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,900
our data that's being Hallows that your

127
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,600
health care institutions add your

128
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,969
financial institutions wherever is worth

129
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,320
something and through the research that

130
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:01,020
we've done and will go through the net

131
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:04,770
diligence report here in a second this

132
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:06,090
is this is what things cost so on the

133
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,620
dark web if you want to buy medical

134
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,119
records they're for sale for anywhere

135
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,150
from a dollar to a thousand dollars

136
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,740
that's how much it cost why why does

137
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:17,159
this range so much what do you guys

138
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:20,640
think yes actually

139
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:24,140
absolutely prescriptions you can get

140
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:29,820
legally drugs by having these records

141
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:32,760
absolutely okay you can also assume an

142
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:34,170
entire identity just by with a complete

143
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,460
Melkor Eckerd think about when you go to

144
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:39,270
the hospital what information are they

145
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:42,919
had like everything driver's license

146
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:46,409
social security number insurance address

147
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:49,430
date of birth some of them in have your

148
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:49,430
stinking license finger

149
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,150
the other one that we'll get to in a

150
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,340
minute this one this one is loyalty

151
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,659
accounts that's my favorite one that's

152
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:01,659
the most interesting one

153
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:04,990
I am very very proud of my Marriott

154
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:06,550
point bounce I travel for work and I

155
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,410
want to be able to take a vacation and

156
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,750
not have paper hotel room if somebody

157
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:13,690
takes my Marriott point balance I'm

158
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:15,130
gonna lose it but that's why this is

159
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,810
right here so the loyalty accounts

160
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,090
that's what we're talking about okay

161
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:21,270
those loyalty account 20 dollars on

162
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:23,799
average you want to steal Jonathan's

163
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:25,448
$500,000 there are 500 thousand points

164
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,060
for Marriott you're gonna ruin my day

165
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:30,430
okay but that's why they're there

166
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,680
because you can take those and get free

167
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:39,600
stuff who doesn't like free stuff in the

168
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:44,020
shirt good okay so I'm on the last one

169
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:51,630
perfect so we're talk about I got I got

170
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:51,630
14 minutes so for two minutes

171
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,270
driver

172
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:08,540
there we go alright so we're going to

173
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,220
talk about three three things that we're

174
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,730
seeing in the middle market that are

175
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:16,340
most faculty who's there this guy

176
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:17,540
I'm taking a straw poll I don't think

177
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:22,250
anybody has because I sure as heck

178
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:25,370
didn't so many showed this coastal

179
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:27,620
engineering is not a new thing

180
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:30,470
it is not new when computers came out

181
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:35,630
right this guy right here yellow kid

182
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:38,500
sold talking dogs what I got a great guy

183
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:44,800
she absolutely that's not thought okay

184
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:47,720
so land two million dollars in the 1890s

185
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:54,020
two million dollars in eighteen is crazy

186
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:57,740
right absolutely crazy so an IT security

187
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:59,720
in our industry we see a lot of stuff we

188
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:02,210
have groups that actually get hired to

189
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,700
go in and do social engineering Ohio a

190
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:07,100
nice especially in the Midwest people

191
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,870
are so helpful if you walk into a bank

192
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,270
and say hey I'm doing an asset inventory

193
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:14,390
I need to go with your serving room get

194
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:17,120
your asset tax don't let you in this

195
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:19,760
happened I even got a three-mile two out

196
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,620
of one okay it's stuff like that we are

197
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,410
so nice and it goes back to training I

198
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,580
think a lot of the other talks that you

199
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,260
guys were yesterday they were they were

200
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:30,590
just wonderful so I won't spend too much

201
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:32,810
but then again ransomware we've seen it

202
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:34,790
we haven't happened with our clients it

203
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,170
is the number one thing besides the

204
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,209
business email compromise that we are

205
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,469
dealing with with our clients and you

206
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,060
got to remember and we're gonna see it

207
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,400
here in a second when we started talking

208
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:45,109
about the data elements and how much

209
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,270
people are spending in the market that

210
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:51,260
we're working with this is a huge gap

211
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:53,750
and it's a huge gap because it costs

212
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,490
money to protect and a lot of folks that

213
00:09:53,750 --> 00:10:00,560
were working with haven't got to that

214
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:02,900
level of materia 64 percent of people

215
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:07,369
right now they're paying the ransom area

216
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:07,760
why why isn't number so high who said

217
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:11,300
that

218
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:14,330
yes if ransomware you pay the money and

219
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:17,569
never got your information unlock the

220
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:19,850
whole market crashes I'm going to pay my

221
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:21,530
Bitcoin or however many bitcoins I'm

222
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:24,770
going to negotiate because of they do

223
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:27,770
negotiate they're gonna in most cases

224
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:32,240
unlock my favor and the cycle that he

225
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:34,100
vintage business email compromised

226
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,170
you've heard it from other speakers I'm

227
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,030
a fan of speaking earlier across the

228
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:40,130
hall one of the keynotes talking about

229
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:43,339
how she got an email from herself that

230
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:47,390
said do you have a second to time it's

231
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:49,820
real it's atthenes absolutely and the

232
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:53,000
what's happening is a couple different

233
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:56,570
things people are giving these emails

234
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,370
and you're helpful by nature if I send

235
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:00,260
Joan an email and say hurry up and do

236
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:02,120
this Joan knows that I actually need

237
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:05,330
help because when I reach out for help

238
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:08,720
it means I actually need right that is

239
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:12,650
how we are interactively so this is

240
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:15,440
that's the time they are our for lack of

241
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:16,240
a better term they are spoofing the the

242
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,839
folk scene

243
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,829
they are getting them to do things the

244
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,869
things that you normally would not

245
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:25,689
social engineering is amazing if you

246
00:11:22,869 --> 00:11:27,579
talk call a call center and be urgent

247
00:11:25,689 --> 00:11:29,980
super-nice put a little bit of a

248
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:33,160
southern accent on they will be super

249
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:34,959
helpful super helpful you can get

250
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,360
account numbers that way

251
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:42,189
it's amazing how what people do just if

252
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:44,860
you are nice so every year our sim

253
00:11:42,189 --> 00:11:48,399
sponsors a co-sponsors with all their ID

254
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:52,600
what is called a cyber insurance trends

255
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:54,399
or cyber insurance step and what it does

256
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,929
is it goes through a whole bunch of

257
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,649
different stuff and it talks about

258
00:11:55,929 --> 00:12:01,869
specifically what are happening from a

259
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:03,910
claims perspective so we've all heard of

260
00:12:01,869 --> 00:12:07,540
cyber insurance if you have it

261
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:11,050
google it the so we're gonna walk

262
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:13,689
through now is from what has actually

263
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,979
been and accepted and paid out claim so

264
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:16,449
remember this it's gonna be a small

265
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,129
piece this isn't going to talk about

266
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:21,969
denials it's just gonna be the payment

267
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:25,809
so from perspective what have we noticed

268
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:36,939
this is criminal what's new here from

269
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:45,299
2017 criminal attacks malicious so the

270
00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:47,319
question so criminal would be so anyway

271
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:52,209
we'll go the next slide and will tell

272
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:54,849
you Sophie to the next time thank you so

273
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:56,768
terminal illness is going to be talking

274
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:58,869
about MOCA it's going to be the left

275
00:12:56,769 --> 00:13:01,509
side so it's going to be your hackers

276
00:12:58,869 --> 00:13:03,790
ransomware malware and then you think

277
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:10,019
here like accidents does that make sense

278
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:10,019
so causes lots of 2018 number one

279
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:22,130
an attack number two not very bright

280
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:24,230
Branson wear this hat right here but

281
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:27,530
this whole conference is about right

282
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:32,690
half of the claims are related to this

283
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:37,160
that's a time industry health care

284
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:40,790
financial services retail then that

285
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:43,699
crazy 18% shouldn't be crazy because

286
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:46,939
most of you know they're spending money

287
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:49,990
on you and complain Xbox as possible in

288
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:52,780
dollars though it's trickling down

289
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:57,430
you're seeing a lot of events here

290
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,430
records expose go through this quickly

291
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:04,160
let's got that from this year

292
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:08,709
couple reasons what happened it's only

293
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:12,579
15 guys what else

294
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:17,630
lucky and retail Verizon what opium

295
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:19,610
target right okay they have to pay a lot

296
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:22,970
of money of 20 in that year

297
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:26,089
so what happens when your insurance

298
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:28,700
carrier a lot of claims you get a little

299
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:29,779
bit more strict southern make me money

300
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,820
you gotta remember insurance companies

301
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:34,610
are business this is how they make their

302
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:38,660
money so that's why you see trending

303
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:40,640
down it went up so we'll see what 2018

304
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:44,240
brings after the year is completed in

305
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:50,510
2019 so the same thing data types data

306
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:51,860
sets that's going to be something a

307
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:54,410
little bit different than what you would

308
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:57,050
normally think everybody thinks about my

309
00:14:54,410 --> 00:15:01,000
data my privacy my social security cards

310
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:03,969
what's different what does this company

311
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,790
company specific data playbooks

312
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:10,850
blueprints how to do the job

313
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:13,219
not nests all these is your specific

314
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:16,700
data or a person specific data PII in

315
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:19,339
this case the target its intellectual

316
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:23,450
property as well and that intellectual

317
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:26,690
property is not just a thing that you've

318
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:28,459
trademarked or your slogan it's going to

319
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:32,540
be everything how much of that

320
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:37,609
intellectual property means exactly that

321
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:39,860
counts absolutely does happiness do the

322
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,990
attacks but again you know come a claim

323
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,019
study this is focusing on the folks that

324
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:48,320
have insurance

325
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:50,750
it reaches claims by sector everybody

326
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:55,160
talked about the market we deal with are

327
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:59,890
some middle market right here in this

328
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:04,930
space we got a pen on small to see but

329
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:09,260
small revenant large target food why

330
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:10,459
forestry why the why do they have more

331
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:13,399
security because they can't afford

332
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:14,359
implement the security there it is it's

333
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:17,510
not in the budget

334
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:19,339
you gotta remember if you have if you're

335
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,870
a billion-dollar organization or million

336
00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:23,000
dollar organization you have one public

337
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:25,370
facing eye teeth are IP address that

338
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,950
anybody can get in and out of but your

339
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:30,769
revenue spend is off make it super

340
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:32,510
simple a hundred bucks on the billion

341
00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:34,279
dollar side and you only got a doll over

342
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:37,160
here and we all know security is a

343
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:40,990
specific percent of that revenue that IT

344
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:44,230
gets you see how the numbers work

345
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:46,430
budgeting guys its capital expenditures

346
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:49,670
if you're interested this is a very very

347
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:51,979
high level yes I did put a QR code at a

348
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:54,920
security conference that you know will

349
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:57,440
have a so if you're interested to read

350
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:00,800
the rest of it it's pretty long it's

351
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,930
pretty interesting but it's in that

352
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,250
building study it's on 2018 there's a

353
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:06,438
lot of other things there's good more

354
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:09,589
things I'm going to nice but if you're

355
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:11,089
looking for it is out there off of this

356
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:12,490
and kind of some other studies that are

357
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:16,069
out there we're going to jump in now to

358
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:18,980
data breaches cost and then the actual

359
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:21,438
odds there actually is a way to tell you

360
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:25,780
in the other day what every I so and I

361
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:31,460
will go into so since 2013

362
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:36,980
well billion dollars in losses this

363
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:38,660
summer we had I got a phone call at 7

364
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,220
o'clock on Sunday and I think you get

365
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:44,040
over to Chicago

366
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:46,620
tomorrow I said sure why would that well

367
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,659
we have five that had a compromise okay

368
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:51,840
our dfi our team is already there their

369
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:54,630
work okay well that's good

370
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,129
what do you need me there for well the

371
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:58,860
FI our team's taken care of the innocent

372
00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:03,390
response but they need remediation help

373
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:06,419
on setups and how this happened and to

374
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:09,350
explain them in a non-technical way how

375
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:12,360
this happened think about it the f ir

376
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:14,189
can't be pretty technical you have to be

377
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,409
able to convert non-technical language

378
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:18,390
excuse me technical language in a

379
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:20,010
non-technical way especially when you're

380
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,480
dealing with people that didn't grow up

381
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:24,660
an IT or have a technical background

382
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,770
it's one of the many talents and why go

383
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,230
and looking University it's like

384
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:33,510
Sandra's that have requirements for

385
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:37,410
communication classes you have to boss

386
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:39,390
here that company ended up it would it

387
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:42,360
was something they had a security tool

388
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:44,580
in place password manager password

389
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,250
manager is what it is it's an

390
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,030
application that application was not set

391
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,710
up securely

392
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:53,670
they lost ten million dollars just

393
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:56,130
someone come and that was over 40 hours

394
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:58,340
within 48 hours cyber insurance to cover

395
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:01,490
it but they will not cover it again so

396
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,490
pretty interesting

397
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,950
classified ravening so this is this I

398
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,510
think I could I like this one because

399
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:12,450
total new to the costs here look at the

400
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:14,580
sizes cost by grabbing each size so if

401
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:22,470
you look at a revenue size who's paying

402
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:25,409
the most smaller companies right the

403
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:29,100
smaller companies have to pay are paying

404
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:31,650
more have the onset of a breach or after

405
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,699
brief remediation just go back to a

406
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,320
buzzard stuff that we talked about

407
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:40,340
earlier and the people believe in that

408
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:40,340
stuff is going to happen probably great

409
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,300
cost comparison now there's a couple

410
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:48,270
things out there this one's interesting

411
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:50,280
because we have the net diligence or

412
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:53,879
study you have IBM's and then we have

413
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:56,310
sippy sippy is specific to financial

414
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:59,070
institutions financial institutions

415
00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:01,260
their average cost is significantly

416
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:06,590
higher than the rest of the average

417
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:06,590
industry the idea that might be

418
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:18,960
Plus

419
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:21,360
it's higher in most cases because what

420
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,250
happens if you are at your bank your

421
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,719
stuff is breached they took money make

422
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,130
you more likely to go to the credit

423
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:32,970
union or a different location on the

424
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:34,980
street what about the hospital well if

425
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:36,240
you're in a smaller community there

426
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,700
might not be another hospital

427
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,530
- thanks on every car I think fifty

428
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:44,250
thirds building - right now in that port

429
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:46,049
right every block there's anyway so it's

430
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:49,320
a lot of the graph we see the reputation

431
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:51,960
of Boston a high higher than in other

432
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,270
areas because it's related and tied to

433
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:58,530
keeping their client base their

434
00:20:54,270 --> 00:21:00,750
customers or their high person one of

435
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:04,168
you team feel bad and have a lot of

436
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:05,850
stuff in the news well we're in the

437
00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:10,520
middle of the back right it could have

438
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:10,520
been worse the United States right hand

439
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,730
little busy

440
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:20,510
Rizzo

441
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:24,620
so I felt bad for the United States now

442
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:28,070
this is from the IBM IBM Post - baby ok

443
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:30,219
so again this any this stuff's also in

444
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:33,020
the net diligence reports as well so

445
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:39,590
five year average lose the five year

446
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:44,690
average all of them except for two are

447
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:46,580
higher than the five year average job

448
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:48,800
and sometimes thirty is not going away

449
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:50,540
right I mean there's a couple million

450
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:53,060
job openings it's going to continue to

451
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:54,399
grab this time away global averages we

452
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:57,409
talked about they're sort of the eyes I

453
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,420
think somebody somebody did a wonderful

454
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:01,220
job yesterday wrong presentations I

455
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:04,310
can't remember who and said if you have

456
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:06,440
a one in 25 minutes something happened

457
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:08,000
to you in the first twenty four it

458
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,330
doesn't is a guaranteed to happen on

459
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,690
25th no and that's the beauty of odds

460
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:17,919
so from some take it like a I'll call

461
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:21,320
the grain of salt as you would the odds

462
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:24,790
27.7% this is gonna happen to the

463
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,790
organizations that we're in the study

464
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,570
who thinks that's a little lower than

465
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,600
expected

466
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:37,590
I think that's a little higher than they

467
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:45,149
able to perspective surprised me a

468
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:48,199
little bit my first slide so anyway so

469
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:48,200
now we're so

470
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,209
[Music]

471
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:06,810
[Music]

472
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,810
sorry guys

473
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,459
yeah

474
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:04,399
[Music]

475
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:17,530
all right so there is an importance to

476
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,879
requiring patches to research here I

477
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:20,970
don't want to have that distract at

478
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:26,830
something that actually doesn t happen

479
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:29,860
but 29 here we go back back to it global

480
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:40,000
averages this is what surprised me the

481
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:43,080
most for this day 197 days average to

482
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,080
discovery of the breach

483
00:24:46,369 --> 00:24:52,499
contain that reach 69 days from the date

484
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:55,340
of discovery why do you think there's

485
00:24:52,499 --> 00:24:55,340
such a large gap there

486
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:01,779
you get a point I can relate they got

487
00:24:58,989 --> 00:25:05,200
into there you go run simply she hear it

488
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:08,229
out exactly so you discover it reach it

489
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:12,009
takes you a while to see the whole

490
00:25:08,229 --> 00:25:13,479
picture the whole picture you can think

491
00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:15,629
they got into one system and said oh

492
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:18,309
it's going to be cleaned up by Friday

493
00:25:15,629 --> 00:25:21,369
well you find out they got into multiple

494
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:23,489
systems it takes longer to go through

495
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:23,488
that

496
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,860
I'm not going to spend too much on this

497
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:32,110
how do we mediate wouldn't we see in the

498
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:33,219
middle market a lot of people has talked

499
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:37,679
about risk management frameworks

500
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:42,250
adopting this tie so whatever it is that

501
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:43,660
gives you two things first thing is what

502
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:46,810
we see in the middle market then was a

503
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:49,660
huge impact and a huge missing area is

504
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:51,840
being able to measure and manage in the

505
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:54,970
security world how you do your job

506
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,699
ticketing system came into play to help

507
00:25:54,970 --> 00:26:00,880
measure how effective and how much work

508
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:02,080
the XE folks actually do because from

509
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,310
the outside it looks like they're just

510
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:08,310
screwing around on their computer all

511
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:11,770
day great same thing with framers it

512
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:14,280
introduces the first way to establish a

513
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:18,940
metric so that you can measure yourself

514
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:22,750
your location your business unit against

515
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:25,330
and establish accepted rubric framework

516
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:27,840
so Krueger's that's what we use that's

517
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:27,840
why there

518
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:33,010
integrated risk management you're gonna

519
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:34,870
hear this term it is the graduation of

520
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:37,510
GRC a lot of people in the last year

521
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:40,479
thought that the GRC tools were being

522
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:42,040
renamed the IRM tools the iron and that

523
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,590
was something that they had to come out

524
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:47,560
and clarify but the GRC tools are being

525
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:50,830
used to leverage the ecosystem this is

526
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:52,990
an ecosystem example okay the number one

527
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:55,510
thing that we're seeing especially in

528
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:57,250
the middle market that has to be done is

529
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:59,140
you have to know what the heck is on

530
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:01,150
your network what do you know what are

531
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:02,920
you trying to protect you can spend all

532
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:06,040
the money in security tools in the world

533
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:08,620
but if you don't have your scope figure

534
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:11,379
it out what you care about and what you

535
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:17,080
don't care about money it's not that

536
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:19,780
help identify your assets define your

537
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:22,810
methodology this is your security

538
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:24,910
program here direction of what you want

539
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:26,649
to monitor this is going to be an

540
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:28,330
example of this would be in these

541
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:30,760
somebody said internal controls

542
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:34,030
okay so again a measurement this is

543
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:37,690
going to be things of locations a lot of

544
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:40,480
people have a enterprise shared services

545
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:42,880
function that enterprise shared services

546
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,390
function does a great job looking at the

547
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:48,970
shared services and it assumes that all

548
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:51,100
of the locations are following the same

549
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:54,700
process but they never have a

550
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:58,300
questionnaire they never go out and see

551
00:27:54,700 --> 00:28:00,340
the site they never go and check that

552
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:04,800
everybody that says they're doing it is

553
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:04,800
actually doing it is it effective

554
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,560
people were talking about risk registers

555
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,600
earlier this is the piece this is the

556
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:14,540
piece of risk registers here risk

557
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,100
analysis risk register tracking you got

558
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,990
to be able to know what your risk are in

559
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:20,679
an organization you got a havoc threat

560
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:22,790
library you gotta have a vulnerability

561
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,560
library as well you've got to know

562
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:27,320
what's happening how that happens a lot

563
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,909
of healthcare last couple years there's

564
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:33,679
been a lot of acquisitions in healthcare

565
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:35,150
okay a lot of people bringing in clinics

566
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,500
for example because they bring them with

567
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:39,140
clinics they can get higher

568
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:41,420
reimbursement rates see large you pull

569
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:44,060
the the better off you are getting

570
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:47,870
getting funds okay those people

571
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:49,580
specifically they come into the new

572
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:51,830
system they give the new applications

573
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:54,590
they get the new computer systems but

574
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:56,330
they never took away the old one so all

575
00:28:54,590 --> 00:29:00,679
of a sudden you're sitting with a closet

576
00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:03,649
or a warehouse full of a million and a

577
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:09,620
half physical directors or a database

578
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:12,500
that's on Windows 2003 or 2007 cases

579
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:14,810
right super super old stuff connected

580
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:17,710
the Internet is that oh is that

581
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:19,879
addressed to the organization absolutely

582
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:21,320
biggest blunder and due diligence that

583
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:24,620
we've seen published recently as

584
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:30,850
Marriott right think about it they

585
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:34,219
acquired they acquired a competitor they

586
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:36,080
went through the process and their due

587
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:39,590
diligence didn't figure out that they

588
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,750
had a breach here we got something for

589
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:44,419
that they own it great I mean you've

590
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:46,670
seen these yeah if you've seen or you

591
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:48,980
get on the Marriott you called him one

592
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:50,570
of their click click the number seven if

593
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,400
you want to hear no more about our data

594
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:53,439
incident it's not agree it's just an

595
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,790
incident

596
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,200
and I think I must later I called and

597
00:29:55,790 --> 00:30:00,260
they have been news name for but I don't

598
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,730
remember what it was so so I almost

599
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:04,480
spent too much more time on this except

600
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:06,200
the last pieces a lot of folks have a

601
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,080
difficulty wrapping their head around

602
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,630
how we're a GRC tool comes into place

603
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:17,720
the GRC tool is designed to get you out

604
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:18,790
of your 2007 Excel sheets and tie it all

605
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,780
together

606
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:22,490
last thing I'll say in the middle market

607
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:24,020
this was missed a lot and I won't spend

608
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,770
too much time on this on the slide

609
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,840
button

610
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:28,940
we have firewalls everybody familiar

611
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:31,939
with the firewalls under network they're

612
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:34,010
there to protect from the outside so

613
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:37,010
many people miss that you have to watch

614
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:42,920
the outgoing traffic as well why do you

615
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:45,290
have to watch the absolutely absolutely

616
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,360
you don't watch the outgoing traffic

617
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,750
traffic and this up guys this happens

618
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,760
all the time

619
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:52,240
first thing we walked into got Barlow

620
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:56,240
yes all right

621
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:58,670
okay that the who said a lot of them got

622
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,679
out a box or you know our firewalls in

623
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:03,950
cloud and you know we just flip the

624
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:05,300
switch and swilley when happens all the

625
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:07,429
time somebody had a great analogy

626
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,720
yesterday it's it's just the box sitting

627
00:31:07,429 --> 00:31:11,530
at a warehouse

628
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:15,230
cloud is not much different than most it

629
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:15,800
right you can cloud this literally no

630
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:17,450
different

631
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:23,389
the only difference is the marketing

632
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:25,220
folks got ahold of it okay summary on

633
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:30,020
this section that we'll all talk about

634
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:32,410
is quit building silos what do you think

635
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,410
I mean meta

636
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:39,529
it's Eric's job to do Eric's things it's

637
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:41,539
my job to do Jonathon things I don't

638
00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:43,309
give up what the heck Eric is supposed

639
00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:47,299
to do I only care about what I'm

640
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:52,960
supposed to do makes sense that's my job

641
00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:52,960
but somewhere between Eric and I usually

642
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:59,840
somewhere between Eric and I there has

643
00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:03,709
to be a bridge that some like Jonah

644
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:07,730
Josh dr. Gary understand what they're

645
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:09,379
both doing so that from a high level we

646
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:11,480
can direct the activities of the

647
00:32:09,379 --> 00:32:22,299
organization to have the most effective

648
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:26,360
program that you can anyway vulture

649
00:32:22,299 --> 00:32:30,039
strategic plans guys it's from the top

650
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:33,490
down if your executives your sea levels

651
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:36,169
they don't buy in they don't do this

652
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:37,870
it's not going to happen it's no

653
00:32:36,169 --> 00:32:41,720
different than those of you that have

654
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:44,658
have your favorite sports team and

655
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:46,190
coaches attitude goes a long way no

656
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:47,769
different than the business world no

657
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:52,970
different in the middle market

658
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:54,769
absolutely not strategic plans no

659
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:56,149
offense guys I don't care how good you

660
00:32:54,769 --> 00:32:57,679
are you're not going to implement the

661
00:32:56,149 --> 00:32:59,750
most effective security program from

662
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,080
zero by next Friday it's just not gonna

663
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:03,380
happen

664
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:06,080
and that's okay

665
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:08,419
but you have to understand what risks

666
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,309
that brings to the organization if it's

667
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:12,559
a financial look risk if it's just

668
00:33:10,309 --> 00:33:14,059
business or reputational you have to

669
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,710
understand these things to make these

670
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:18,168
decisions because when you look to build

671
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:19,640
this two to three year plan five-year

672
00:33:18,169 --> 00:33:20,990
plans in some cases might be a little

673
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,660
bit too far out because it's too many

674
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:25,039
changes I know an arson what I did 24

675
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:27,830
months ago that has nothing to do with

676
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:30,110
what I'm doing today it was a foundation

677
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:33,039
but we've graduated significantly in the

678
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:33,039
last 24 months

679
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:41,779
people often laugh at policies

680
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:44,989
insecurity well I got a policy that

681
00:33:41,779 --> 00:33:48,529
doesn't mean squat you're right you're

682
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:51,639
not following it you don't have a Creed

683
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:54,259
upon policy as an organization and

684
00:33:51,639 --> 00:33:55,789
you're not calling them they are worth

685
00:33:54,259 --> 00:34:01,029
as much as the paper that they are

686
00:33:55,789 --> 00:34:04,789
printed on if they're printed right so

687
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:07,700
from a policy perspective you have to

688
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:10,489
have folks that understand a couple

689
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:13,339
things policies are important we get

690
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:15,618
back but what often is forgotten in the

691
00:34:13,339 --> 00:34:18,529
markets that we're working with is they

692
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:22,579
are there for a secondary reason that's

693
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:27,470
turning it is the playbook of the

694
00:34:22,579 --> 00:34:30,500
organization to understand and sustain

695
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:33,638
itself over and over and over and over

696
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:35,960
if you are unable to sustain yourself

697
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:42,760
over and over and over and over again

698
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:45,109
what happens by your going okay so

699
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,480
typically the thing that we're seeing is

700
00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:50,239
and what and what is helpful is how

701
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,770
policy that's just that a policy if you

702
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,328
want to clean it up have a separate

703
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:57,130
document or a second section that talks

704
00:34:53,329 --> 00:34:59,540
about your procedures then have your

705
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:01,339
attack plans and your implementing or

706
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:04,549
your standards and your procedures

707
00:35:01,339 --> 00:35:08,000
separate in your company's version of a

708
00:35:04,549 --> 00:35:09,890
wiki or something of that nature you

709
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,819
don't need to have policies that are

710
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:12,379
this big

711
00:35:10,819 --> 00:35:14,509
you need to have policies that are

712
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:17,310
effective that point to your procedures

713
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:20,910
those procedures then can go and move

714
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:24,840
each time and then the last one this is

715
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:27,960
I should have under my hat I'll do that

716
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:30,330
for the next one we understand the risk

717
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:33,090
of what your onboarding in your system

718
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:39,029
or managing a new system before you do

719
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:41,460
it if you can't I get it I give it I

720
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:44,760
work in the space we're still educating

721
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:47,380
the folks that didn't grow up an IT and

722
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:51,810
I see superior

723
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:51,810
cyber intelligence what is it

724
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:58,430
talk about the dark web

725
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:02,420
this is one of our new upcoming spaces

726
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:04,609
of the firm my date has been breached my

727
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:07,490
first ever account that I've reached for

728
00:36:04,609 --> 00:36:10,369
some reason was my Walmart account and

729
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:12,890
then my Gmail and then snapchat happened

730
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:15,079
and then I started deleting all my

731
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:19,069
online profiles because one I never use

732
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:23,589
them and at that time I still had really

733
00:36:19,069 --> 00:36:23,589
bad password management practices so

734
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:29,329
cyber threat intelligence there's five

735
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:31,640
ways to define key that takeaway areas

736
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:34,460
that I think report for you guys to take

737
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:37,038
today start active profiles there are

738
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:38,210
people out there that that monitor and

739
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:39,619
we're going to get into the dark web 3

740
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:43,130
in a little bit and I'm short on time so

741
00:36:39,619 --> 00:36:45,380
I'm gonna go quick people are out here

742
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:50,119
to do investigations on what sits on the

743
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:52,849
dark line exists they are done multiple

744
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:55,420
ways you can do with my datasets just

745
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:57,589
investigative you can look for specific

746
00:36:55,420 --> 00:37:01,339
targets or what else is out there

747
00:36:57,589 --> 00:37:05,660
you can also do intelligence briefings

748
00:37:01,339 --> 00:37:10,819
on sea levels can't tell you how many

749
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:12,558
times you go on LinkedIn and you can

750
00:37:10,819 --> 00:37:14,029
find whatever you need the social

751
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:18,319
engineer your way I'm doing an

752
00:37:14,029 --> 00:37:21,470
organization happens all the time we are

753
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:23,599
sharing and helpful by nature and let's

754
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:24,950
go to New York City then it's a little

755
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:26,390
bit different out there you just got to

756
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:27,390
be the brunt of them as they are view

757
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:32,850
and you can real

758
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:34,350
that time what we're also seeing this

759
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:36,839
building out internal threat

760
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:38,850
intelligence capabilities and this isn't

761
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,890
don't think of it is this big

762
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:43,380
complicated threat intelligence super

763
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:45,000
crazy gotta have this fancy stuff it can

764
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:47,640
be as simple as somebody that just

765
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,430
crawls through social media it can be is

766
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:54,089
and down and deep into the weeds as

767
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:56,850
going to the dark web looking at forums

768
00:37:54,090 --> 00:38:03,750
and see if your data sits on so there's

769
00:37:56,850 --> 00:38:06,120
a full spectrum that exists from the

770
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:11,400
organization standpoint when we talk

771
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:12,660
about what's on the dark web again we

772
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:16,080
talked about risk management we've

773
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:19,259
talked about the risk of a a unencrypted

774
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:21,509
laptop for example well the rich matrix

775
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,830
can't exist and does exist for data that

776
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:27,330
steps out of this one

777
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:30,120
so from we like the the five the five

778
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:32,460
one because I always when we did the

779
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:34,500
three risk categories low medium high

780
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:36,630
always felt informational chips and so

781
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,980
England they didn't listen to me but it

782
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:41,190
just automatically turned out the green

783
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:42,450
so I was pretty happy so yeah five

784
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:46,830
different levels I think a couple things

785
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:50,100
here to take into consideration is you

786
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:54,660
know mission-critical zero-day still the

787
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:56,670
popularity of zero days and at least in

788
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:58,560
the market we're working with is is on

789
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:02,070
the lower end it's the basic stuff

790
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:04,200
social engineering click this link now

791
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:06,990
you know your Amazon package was

792
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,669
delivered I got really good fishing test

793
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:10,229
the other day it said your account is or

794
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:13,440
any of the are some credit union you

795
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:17,550
don't have cranium so simple things like

796
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:21,240
that I will admit the Amazon package

797
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:21,660
delivered one almost got me almost got

798
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:26,279
me

799
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:27,839
they are they are getting better I'm

800
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,660
gonna spend the last four five minutes

801
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:32,760
on the dark web we've done we do an

802
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:34,440
annual investigation just to kind of go

803
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:37,470
out and do our read show our tour this

804
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:39,270
is actually one of ten speaking

805
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:41,009
engagements that barson is doing in the

806
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:43,290
state of Iowa so this is actually the

807
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:45,330
third ones that fall so we're gonna go

808
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:47,130
through this here pretty quickly this is

809
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:48,900
the clean one oh I'll be honest with you

810
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:51,510
we didn't bring we got some dirty ones

811
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:53,670
too obviously those of you that don't

812
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:55,650
know about the dark web to get there you

813
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:57,090
can't just go google it right you can't

814
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:59,810
use your Chrome browser there's a

815
00:39:57,090 --> 00:40:02,670
special way to do that and specifically

816
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:05,310
when you hear the term dark web it

817
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:09,180
sounds super fun super crazy but what is

818
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:11,670
it where is it and what percent traffic

819
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:13,500
is it laughter some of the internet that

820
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:15,420
we live in today is what's called the

821
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,940
surface web service publisher Google's

822
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:21,150
your emails you still use your on your

823
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:25,410
topical things like that your deep web

824
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:27,330
is gonna be things like your databases

825
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:29,430
your LexisNexis databases for those of

826
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:31,290
you that had to use them to write some

827
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:36,120
sort of paper when you're in college and

828
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:38,040
then some big chunk right big chunk

829
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:40,770
think of it I don't need a website so

830
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:43,529

somebody else is calling me trying to do

836
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:57,430
something and then the dark web 5%

837
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:07,349
tour sites they got marketplaces

838
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:08,839
forms-based site search engines and

839
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:12,119

852
00:41:46,229 --> 00:41:49,529
show us when that works they've got

853
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,239
forums they've got political advocacy

854
00:41:49,529 --> 00:41:52,799
groups they've got whistleblowing

855
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:56,039
this is where the WikiLeaks dump is this

856
00:41:52,799 --> 00:42:02,299
is where this stuff goes how many of you

857
00:41:56,039 --> 00:42:02,299
heard of WikiLeaks yeah how do you good

858
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:09,450
Financial Services take five pounds loan

859
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:10,740
the credit card that's actually kind of

860
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:12,720
cool there's there's some more

861
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:14,220
legitimate stuff or if you have a like

862
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,078
an office key card you can mail it in

863
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:21,058
get it back for the weekend like 17

864
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:23,309
different versions of the same thing is

865
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:24,960
interesting you can browse by category

866
00:42:23,309 --> 00:42:29,490
let's markedly like the color scheme of

867
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:31,799
Amazon right so you buy gold jewel you

868
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:35,729
can have other listings security and OC

869
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:38,538
you can hire a hacker not that expensive

870
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:38,539
- believe it or not

871
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:44,529
there's sensitive information there's

872
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:50,380
merchandise in my opinion drugs you can

873
00:42:44,529 --> 00:42:52,390
buy information ECI accounts I can

874
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:54,309
showed earlier how much they can go for

875
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:57,808
that was through the investigation that

876
00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:57,809
we did here to give you an apple

877
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:05,770
now who's on the dark way I have no

878
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:08,410
motive or incentive to go on the dark

879
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:10,569
web I just I'd rather go hang out

880
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:12,700
outside right do something a little bit

881
00:43:10,569 --> 00:43:14,259
different so to be on the dark web to be

882
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:17,169
doing these things you gotta have a

883
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:18,730
reason right you just people just go out

884
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:21,520
there browse it and hang out and read it

885
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:24,460
like Google News okay you gotta have a

886
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:26,440
reason and there's a matrix here of the

887
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:28,510
attack type so you have to have the

888
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:30,640
motive the activity and then there's an

889
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:32,200
attack type so for example you have an

890
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,690
insider you know who this guy is now

891
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:39,430
hope you converted the Apple bug bounty

892
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:40,839
program companies now are offering money

893
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:43,660
for those of you who are in sometimes

894
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:46,240
jobs for those of you that fine exploits

895
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:48,009
and systems that are owned by a large

896
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,930
company one of the guys that I went to

897
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:52,150
school I think got a job at one of the

898
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:55,629

899
00:43:52,150 --> 00:44:00,839
