1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:07,759
yeah what is

2
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:18,710
everybody gets dirty here we have

3
00:00:16,009 --> 00:00:20,880
properties adjunct professor at the

4
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:25,470
University of Michigan and Thomas Edison

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:28,668
State University to talk about risks we

6
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,668
have connected in

7
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:38,600
leave these out you guys to look at

8
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,980
during or after this is a radar

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,650
treatment that we have on the 80

10
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,089
vehicles this is a light argument I

11
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:50,050
don't know if anybody's ever seen them

12
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:50,050
before so they're here please keep those

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:03,349
so today I'm going to talk about the GPS

14
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:05,089
and light are the different attacks to

15
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:07,240
them and how to defend against these

16
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:07,240
attacks

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,640
all right so I'm Charles Parker in the

18
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:16,830
second few graduate degrees at a

19
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,560
certificate and other coursework for

20
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:23,700
microwave schools very exciting very

21
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,710
extensive now I may be a lawyer

22
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,230
but I'm not good lord but I'm not your

23
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,690
lawyer and some of them come into play a

24
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:34,470
little bit later I'll explain all that

25
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:37,429
applies presently I work as a

26
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:41,310
cybersecurity lab engineer for Tier one

27
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:47,090
manufacturer so we'll get modules that

28
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:49,710
come in and our job is to attack them

29
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:53,070
break them down and look into the for

30
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:55,910
its political circuits the leads try to

31
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,380
pull firmware off and won't try to put

32
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:01,380
masking messages and them so they don't

33
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:05,780
work anymore and then reportable

34
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:08,759
vulnerabilities back to our client and

35
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,890
also how to mediate them so we're not

36
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:14,220
just saying well you guys screw up we're

37
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:16,549
saying these are some vulnerabilities it

38
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:20,250
may mean your best interest to fix them

39
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:24,330
unless you want to be in the paper the I

40
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:26,530
am I Twitter I used to put most

41
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,860
everything I do on my publication

42
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:34,360
hang on Twitter but lately has just been

43
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:36,640
my blog now later later you have two

44
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:40,960
questions concerns comments please feel

45
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:44,079
free to email me I think I have most of

46
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:48,250
the Charles part of the sentence Yahoo

47
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,680
Gmail Outlook proton jail I probably

48
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:55,990
missed a couple but if you hit any of

49
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:59,640
those they will respond I promise my

50
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:04,390
focus is to make try to make this place

51
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:08,350
better for a safer environment a better

52
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:11,290
environment so we can go on the internet

53
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:13,390
and not have to worry as much so you can

54
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:17,530
drive your car and not have to worry

55
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:23,429
about the bad actor attacking the fleet

56
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:23,430
and crashing into you that's my blog

57
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:29,959
alright so there's a lot to cover and so

58
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,670
this isn't death by PowerPoint I have a

59
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:36,010
lot of pictures I want to share with you

60
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:39,589
we had a lot of information do not

61
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:43,179
seriously do not try this at home by an

62
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:46,460
airport by annual service by the police

63
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,560
anybody unless you're authorized your

64
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:51,410
life can get very interesting very

65
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,900
quickly there are people who drive black

66
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:58,549
sedans that don't like what we do

67
00:03:53,900 --> 00:04:02,540
sometimes at government agencies the

68
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:04,640
content of this presentation is fine for

69
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,410
it if you ever notice you get this

70
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,570
disclaimer before they show you how to

71
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:13,160
do something dangerous this is for

72
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:17,980
educational purposes only this is my

73
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:20,980
opinion nothing to do with my employer I

74
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,980
promise

75
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:26,159
the what we're going to go over today is

76
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:30,600
not intended to be a substitute for you

77
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:34,169
feeling professional advice and kind of

78
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:39,360
tracking someone for education purposes

79
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:41,250
long any of the testing that we go over

80
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,009
should actually be done by a

81
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:47,639
professional who's been doing it so you

82
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:49,259
don't get surprises if you if you get

83
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:53,130
professional advice please don't ignore

84
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:57,180
it you like to get interesting totally

85
00:04:53,130 --> 00:05:00,680
different way you're like rolling in

86
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,680
this information stock your own risk

87
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:11,260
informational purposes only exciting

88
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:13,330
so recommendations are not guaranteed

89
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:16,000
for future performance so whatever we go

90
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:18,370
over today if a new technology comes out

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:24,310
tomorrow today's information may not be

92
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:26,740
good or as a point forward well this is

93
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:29,800
a good one unauthorized entry is illegal

94
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:32,710
the evil and of some cases that you

95
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,360
considered terrorism please only do it

96
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,940
if you've been authorized and you have a

97
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,420
contract to sign and hand by authorized

98
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:45,880
personnel you don't want to get a visit

99
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:51,480
from the five-o or a three-letter agency

100
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:54,900
so Jason Street I've ever met have been

101
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:57,310
in a venue with him very smart person

102
00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:01,060
the one thing from the quote that I

103
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:03,640
picked up on is what did you do what did

104
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:06,520
you do today to make things better which

105
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:10,479
is why I give presentations why I teach

106
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:15,430
is why I have too many degrees so it's

107
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:18,040
not red vs. blue it's red and blue

108
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,969
working together so it's not if you get

109
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,819
down with your pet

110
00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:24,549
it's not I told you so hard you're going

111
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:26,679
back to the ice image it's more these

112
00:06:24,549 --> 00:06:32,529
vulnerabilities let's work together to

113
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:35,188
fix a once productive one is so

114
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:35,189
background

115
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:41,110
but vehicle said anything that's

116
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:43,240
connected we're all moving at the

117
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:45,280
breakneck speed towards more

118
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,340
connectivity and a t-butyl it's

119
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,489
autonomous drive we're seeing it on the

120
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:55,810
roads now especially in Metro Detroit

121
00:06:50,490 --> 00:07:02,890
there are some one hand Arbor you have

122
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:05,610
the driverless shuttle Nate mobility as

123
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:09,310
a darker the shuttle in Metro Detroit

124
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:12,280
one of the major roads in Metro is

125
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:15,100
Telegraph there's a bus line that's been

126
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,179
driving a planned route along that for

127
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,660
about three years now

128
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:22,030
it's communist there's a human there the

129
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:26,200
seat just in case but this has been

130
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:29,739
running and operating for years now with

131
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:32,979
these is not just that it's the

132
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,960
technology being applied to these the

133
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:37,720
users are demanding it and they're

134
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,180
voting with their dollars they're buying

135
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,940
the cars that are more connected that

136
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,440
have a better user experience and that's

137
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,630
not going to slow down everybody's

138
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,150
looking forward toward the ad vehicles

139
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:51,370
like you see in the movies like iRobot

140
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:54,039
you just get in and go that's where

141
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:56,530
that's where we're going it's not gonna

142
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:59,760
be here soon as we and the users want

143
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,760
but it is coming

144
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:07,270
and with other vehicles with the sensors

145
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,109
we have on there now so we have whiteout

146
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:11,650
radar

147
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:14,110
cameras and a few other sensors right

148
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:18,310
now they are only generating 60 of data

149
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:20,170
a day when as we advance more put more

150
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:22,720
and better sensors on there's going to

151
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:24,940
be a lot more data generated every day

152
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,350
as well as something else for everybody

153
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,630
to think about it wouldíve anything to

154
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:34,780
do with the data how to get it from the

155
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:37,900
car to the OEM for their cloud wherever

156
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:40,390
it's going for analysis you don't

157
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,970
remember that that's another thing to

158
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:45,310
think about it also farm equipment we've

159
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:49,300
seen that the equipment out there in the

160
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:53,410
fields number of different uses for soil

161
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:55,449
sampling weed location accurate planning

162
00:08:53,410 --> 00:09:00,490
accurate down to centimeter planning

163
00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:03,190
planting or the cross and that's not

164
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:07,320
even that's not even half of all the

165
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,320
applications will get a photographer so

166
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:13,439
in a vehicle because that are out there

167
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:17,650
just now there's a number of sensors

168
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:22,180
each sensor is important each sensor as

169
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:25,180
its own job so lidar radar

170
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:30,400
campus and others each of these as they

171
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:33,160
operate passive and active are pulling

172
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:38,840
data from the environment each data

173
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:40,610
point they use as not just something to

174
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:45,170
they're taking the data points and

175
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:47,480
building a path so that the vehicle can

176
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:51,439
decide what's in front of it what's

177
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:54,590
around it but it what the intent is for

178
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:58,070
the vehicle not to run into a tree or a

179
00:09:54,590 --> 00:10:00,740
human or a stop sign so what it does is

180
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:04,670
it takes all the data points from all

181
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:07,520
the sensors accumulates them analyzes on

182
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:09,620
the correlates in between them so if two

183
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:12,680
of the three sensors say oh there's a

184
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:15,529
tree right in front of you based on the

185
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:19,130
coding for the vehicle it takes action

186
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:21,500
based on that so it's not just one

187
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:24,460
sensor says oh there's a tree and all

188
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:31,310
the other ones say well you're clearly

189
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:33,950
takes all that for the lidar there are a

190
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:38,089
bunch of minor factors it like has been

191
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:39,890
around for forever seems like I mean

192
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:45,320
there's some other big ones well I don't

193
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:47,949
know why those are two of the more

194
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,000
prevalent ones that you'll see out there

195
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:54,130
but there are many more than those

196
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,079
there's some pictures on them

197
00:10:54,130 --> 00:11:00,459
so one-liner of all the different

198
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:05,410
sensors that are out there why are why

199
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:07,560
are we using lighter so my initial

200
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:10,060
thought I was watching Elon Musk and

201
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,130
it's left one of his last meetings he

202
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,138
was just going off about why darkness

203
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:17,350
Only Fools will use a light our

204
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:20,970
immaturity just spent about 30 minutes

205
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:20,970
out of white light light arts useless

206
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:32,009
but it's it is not totally useless there

207
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:36,190
are issues with it over that but

208
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:37,870
lighters used as as part of the layer of

209
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:39,370
sensors in the vehicle that are

210
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:42,250
gathering information about the

211
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:44,769
environment alone maybe they're not that

212
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:47,440
great but using the junction with

213
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:51,899
everything else they work perfectly fine

214
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:54,690
and it's a good additional point to use

215
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:58,600
they work in a daytime and nighttime

216
00:11:54,690 --> 00:12:00,220
these are these have been refined to the

217
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,699
point where they can recognize where

218
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:07,120
your are the lane the vehicles now have

219
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:08,709
Lane Assist so if you start to go one

220
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,620
way or another you get a little nudge in

221
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:13,189
the sequel wake up it's one of the

222
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,589
president juices

223
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:17,870
they can recognize license plates street

224
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:22,970
signs of course humans because who don't

225
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:25,610
want to run over a human in fact if they

226
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:28,399
discipline considered an active sensor

227
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:30,019
because it's sending the pulse out the

228
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,540
waiting for that wants to come back for

229
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:37,220
the data point it's not waiting for

230
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:39,680
something but just to come in and so

231
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,689
we've looked at Wyatt light out so it's

232
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:46,519
like a why not

233
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:49,849
why are it's like it is exceptionally

234
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:52,790
vulnerable to attack unfortunately but

235
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:55,310
this with the current version that are

236
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:59,660
out there now it's not perfect nothing

237
00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:02,959
really is one of the first big

238
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:07,100
publications on this was presented at

239
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:08,630
blackhat 2015 by Jonathan got a message

240
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:13,280
last night

241
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:16,970
the team he's involved with em city if

242
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:20,540
you want more information about vehicle

243
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:25,100
cybersecurity a good sources em city to

244
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:27,650
go to dr. Google News University of

245
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,480
Michigan M city and it'll pull up all

246
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:34,069
the information and all the publications

247
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:37,610
but they have a whole mock city set up

248
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:40,340
with street signs streetlights buildings

249
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:43,820
so that if you have a TV vehicle

250
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:49,420
autonomous tried and tested screaming

251
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:52,910
but anyway I think press so in his

252
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:56,750
research it was able to remotely tamper

253
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:59,030
with the camera in the liner and so the

254
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:05,360
camera was mobile i over there models

255
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:07,430
lidar was what he was able and that's

256
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,460
kind of redundant or what he was able to

257
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:14,959
do and this is a one of the images from

258
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:17,480
his paper he was able to do the attack

259
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:20,810
generate the false wall around the

260
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:24,320
vehicle so the sensor the lighters in

261
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:26,030
the camera sensor it thought that there

262
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,400
was a wall around it so it wouldn't be

263
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:30,680
able to drive through the area since

264
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:35,060
they thought it received it was a wall

265
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:37,900
about them and unfortunately that's

266
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,900
someone

267
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:48,650
so so with the target we're talking

268
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:50,030
about flight Arsenal the target I was

269
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:52,430
looking at well what's what the major

270
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:54,560
manufacturers so there's felony they

271
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:57,069
have a number of different models here

272
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,180
are two right here and you would think

273
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:01,450
well these are going on the Navy

274
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:03,920
vehicles it's gonna be somewhat hard to

275
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:08,600
get one of them on tourism you just

276
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:10,579
can't go to Walmart violent but

277
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,940
unfortunately it's not only not that it

278
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:16,130
wasn't that difficult so there are many

279
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,020
manufacturers many targets for

280
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:21,350
manufacturers so what you can do is just

281
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:25,010
contact them and that's what I did on

282
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:26,030
the top I just reached out to their

283
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:28,910
inside sales

284
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:30,319
they just got back to me with usually is

285
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,980
there anything else we can do for you so

286
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:37,310
my next question was going would be one

287
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:43,130
day and I work for make up whatever

288
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:45,619
company so the tool of models that you'd

289
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:50,360
probably see with vehicles that are out

290
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:53,240
there are the puck and the HTML - 64

291
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,860
feet light art bell o'clock I've got one

292
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:59,630
here if you want to look at it later

293
00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:00,710
feel free it's a pretty basic you know

294
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:03,980
in depending on how much cash you

295
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:06,350
inspect how much money a burden in your

296
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:09,260
pocket you can buy a puck for about

297
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:12,710
thirty two hundred or if you're really

298
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:17,740
excited you can go and get the HDL model

299
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:20,910
on the right you probably see more

300
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:23,460
summer vehicles

301
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:24,780
they expel you - nah - right that's the

302
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:31,020
one you usually see on the top of

303
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:36,300
vehicle spinning like for Google I think

304
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:38,640
you google vehicles use those a lot but

305
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:41,640
yeah it's they both pretty much have the

306
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:43,410
same function but it's just how advanced

307
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:49,439
do you want to get how exciting do you

308
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:51,130
want to get about the test so to start

309
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,970
the test

310
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:56,830
the pen test the first step is to do

311
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,940
your recon so you want to know but you

312
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:00,460
want to find out everything you can

313
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:03,730
without being too intrusive and setting

314
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:05,680
off the red flag so naturally I went

315
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:07,839
online like everybody else I want the

316
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:11,550
doctor go babe it just tightened in a

317
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:15,429
basic rudimentary search I didn't do any

318
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:19,720
google dorks with it like anybody else

319
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:23,320
could type it so it's just a general

320
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:26,290
internet search nothing exciting so I

321
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:28,540
was able to get data sheets manuals

322
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:30,670
everything I needed to make my life

323
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:34,360
easier as I was telling Porter with the

324
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:35,920
test now with the manuals you one would

325
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,639
think well they kept those button down

326
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,780
pretty well these days I thought the

327
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,920
attacks have been out there with the

328
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:47,710
automaker's with AWS everything else

329
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:50,290
thank you I know they're going to blot

330
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:52,480
out certain data that they don't want

331
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:55,840
everybody to see that's usually

332
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,240
unfortunately not the case so as you go

333
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,770
out there the different manuals what you

334
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:04,300
can do is look for default passwords

335
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:10,120
configuration files another data and

336
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:15,010
link your life easier and so I just

337
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:17,500
happen across a Emmanuel and few data

338
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:22,600
sheets so here's one of the data sheets

339
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:25,610
that this is a sheet from the data right

340
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:32,629
so this is from a much larger time

341
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:35,059
it was 50 60 pages Germaine and I got I

342
00:18:32,629 --> 00:18:38,090
was English you hear these documents

343
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:40,730
within just a general internet search do

344
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:42,529
anything exciting that would get me in

345
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:52,159
trouble with anybody that did not

346
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:55,539
acquire this through other means all

347
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:58,399
right so just take a look at it just for

348
00:18:55,539 --> 00:19:00,919
under a minute though but can you see

349
00:18:58,399 --> 00:19:04,178
anything on here that would be excited

350
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:08,359
that you might use if you do work just

351
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:09,669
we're intent on taking one of the

352
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:14,389
modules so wavelength

353
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:16,519
I also weigh 20 pounds we'll look at

354
00:19:14,389 --> 00:19:28,879
what I thought was funny and probably

355
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:30,950
modulation then the deputy but you know

356
00:19:28,879 --> 00:19:33,490
thank you appreciate it

357
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:36,279
that's not hard to discover without that

358
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:38,730
yeah yeah but it's one less thing for

359
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:41,370
less fertile one less thing for me to do

360
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:42,610
they're gonna if they're gonna give you

361
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,678
data

362
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,750
I certainly will take them so I don't

363
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:48,520
have to discover it I don't have to I

364
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:56,890
don't even have to think about it it's

365
00:19:48,520 --> 00:20:00,250
right there the other thing and this is

366
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:04,240
whole this is all free range all the

367
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:09,730
data you want everything you want some

368
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:12,549
of it attacks the information that you

369
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:14,890
need to do that you need to start and do

370
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:18,690
the planning is easy they're not that

371
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:21,070
difficult and so with the attacks

372
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:26,760
they're usually two ways to look at

373
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:26,760
internal and external so the internal is

374
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:32,470
so you have access to the inside of the

375
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:34,830
vehicle or the vehicle itself you're

376
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:40,750
going to sit in it hold the dash back

377
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:42,760
plug into the USB obd whatever you want

378
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:44,710
you're able to manipulate the hardware

379
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,140
or the vehicle for an extended period of

380
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:49,720
time

381
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:51,700
external are want the attacks where

382
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:55,260
you're sitting next to the expressway

383
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:58,750
you're sitting next to the neighborhood

384
00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:01,658
you're not right you're not right there

385
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:03,059
with a vehicle so if they have a ring

386
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:05,220
doorbell or other

387
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:07,710
muttering they don't have you on video

388
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:12,149
in their car tearing it apart trying to

389
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:15,149
connect or something I tend to focus

390
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:20,158
more on the external tax like this like

391
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:22,739
somebody just like a bad actor would if

392
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:25,860
you have a Tesla and it's parked in a

393
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:30,179
parking lot you're more likely to try to

394
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:32,969
connect to it from hundred meters away

395
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:36,539
you're not as likely to get up next to

396
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:38,490
the car try the door get in it and start

397
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:43,649
tearing stuff apart to try to connect

398
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:45,629
with the can in the car oh that's lame

399
00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:48,600
that's my captain visit that's my

400
00:21:45,629 --> 00:21:50,279
Captain Obvious quote criminals don't

401
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,820
want to get caught so that's why

402
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:57,899
generally it's more of the external

403
00:21:52,820 --> 00:22:00,749
attack so with the Tesla and an example

404
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:02,908
of this so you have a Tesla hacked by 10

405
00:22:00,749 --> 00:22:05,399
cent this was the first really big

406
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:07,860
attack to them

407
00:22:05,399 --> 00:22:10,709
what they will do they secure the Tesla

408
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:13,559
they bolted and you know the - that's

409
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:15,990
right that's a huge piece of plastic

410
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:18,480
they were able to pull it back examine

411
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:22,320
everything they saw port plugged into it

412
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:25,350
and that's how they were able to through

413
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,710
their research get published and show

414
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:30,649
they had to attack

415
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:33,860
Tesla that's very busy attack everybody

416
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:37,370
can see what you're doing and the time

417
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:39,850
element this this took a lot of time for

418
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:39,850
them next

419
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:49,250
so the first attack is sensor saturation

420
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:52,090
so the light our unit is exposed even

421
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:55,400
you can see it on the front of the car

422
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:57,439
there will be a section of the usually a

423
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:01,280
section of the grow that's exposed and

424
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:05,120
you'll see something certain or what

425
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:08,510
have you fair that's they well that's

426
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:12,080
one area I have some other pictures of

427
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:14,870
where they're attached to the sideview

428
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,790
mirrors of the car so you have it a

429
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:20,439
mirror and they attach them to the

430
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:23,120
bottom of the mirror and they're free

431
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:27,410
they're pretty sleep they're not as big

432
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:30,860
as this one you can see I mean that

433
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:32,390
looks pretty heavy and tall the ones

434
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:36,669
that they have when the vehicles now or

435
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:38,870
a lot smaller but you'll see them there

436
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:43,930
sometimes you have to look because they

437
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:43,929
blend in that well and

438
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:48,440
okay so you know where the so you know

439
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:51,200
where the sensors are on the vehicle so

440
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:56,570
what you can do is once you have two

441
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:59,030
wavelength of the laser point the laser

442
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:01,730
light added to over saturate the month

443
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:04,070
so the module is sending out pulses and

444
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:06,440
waiting for pulses to come back at a

445
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:08,810
regular interval because that's what

446
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:12,140
it's programmed to do but if that was

447
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:14,810
strong enough laser you can saturate it

448
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:18,080
so it's always receiving the point of

449
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:21,679
what they what it thinks is the pulse so

450
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,960
it's a lot like a das attack or if you

451
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:27,350
have multiple a DDoS attack so it's only

452
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:30,800
respecting you know whatever the pulse

453
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:34,310
is and it's just it's saturates it's

454
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:37,510
receiving a t pulse but it's perceived

455
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:37,510
as a pulse all the time

456
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,110
so the attack tools are kind of

457
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:47,559
different options appear if you want to

458
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:51,789
do this the first is if you want to use

459
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:52,539
a weak relator cost around $40 if you're

460
00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:55,480
excited

461
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:57,158
you can spend up to 350 just on a basic

462
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,130
laser but you have to match it up with

463
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:02,730
the Waypoint there we some assembly

464
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:07,120
required with this it's not too

465
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:11,500
extravagant now if you're not a DIY

466
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:13,928
person you can always buy equipment to

467
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:17,080
do it there would be some modification

468
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:21,279
with this if you wanted to use this

469
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:24,158
instead of in Metro this and other units

470
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:26,289
are sold locally and the vendors are

471
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:34,320
more than happy to sub you all you want

472
00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:34,320
to buy this was only under grant

473
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:41,960
so together it puts that it's still not

474
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:50,070
sensor spoofing this is a little

475
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:54,060
different so with the saturation it's

476
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:59,610
receiving a constant pulse so it's it's

477
00:25:54,060 --> 00:26:01,350
it's confused on what's going on the

478
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:06,449
sensor spoofing it's a little different

479
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:09,750
so you're again deceiving the the

480
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:15,230
modulator so instead of a tree being

481
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:20,220
three meters away what you can do is

482
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:23,850
make the car believe that there's a tree

483
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:27,390
closer there's another object closer or

484
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:30,120
further away and again this doesn't cost

485
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:31,560
us much to piece of to pieces my

486
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,469
hardware and you're going to be you

487
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:37,950
would handy break into test kit a

488
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:40,140
photodiode and a pulse laser diode unit

489
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:42,530
with this with this version you have to

490
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,530
buy both

491
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:53,709
of $1 so under 25 for that part so you

492
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:56,159
have to use them together you know I

493
00:26:53,710 --> 00:27:00,220
have to have a driver to instruct the

494
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:03,999
hardware hardware how we work what an

495
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:09,869
impulse to send timing-wise so it picks

496
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:12,669
up a pulse image so what you're doing is

497
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:16,178
you're telling the module that there's

498
00:27:12,669 --> 00:27:18,759
something in in its way that's really

499
00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:21,340
not there so you're constructing for the

500
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:24,129
module another data point another set of

501
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:27,570
data points or something whatever you

502
00:27:24,129 --> 00:27:27,570
want to put around like a fence

503
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:39,719
relaying this is another type of the tag

504
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:41,549
very pretty much the same thing so again

505
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:46,860
you putting out a false image to the

506
00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:49,200
module so you can see there's several

507
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:54,209
ways to do this unfortunately that's why

508
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:58,399
you need many sensors there to grab all

509
00:27:54,210 --> 00:28:01,470
of the points so I'm going to correlate

510
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:04,439
from animal house for those of a certain

511
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:08,669
vintage like me so there's several

512
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:12,360
defenses though out there to help to

513
00:28:08,669 --> 00:28:14,190
make these more safe and there's the

514
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,809
fences were for the different modules

515
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:22,350
that are out there for the raid out of

516
00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:24,119
the GPS cameras so when you when I say

517
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:27,779
although it's not lost there are

518
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:30,330
defenses and things to help with this so

519
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:33,299
you can have redundancy that lasers

520
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:36,570
would within the same type congrat

521
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:37,980
placers with different wavelengths this

522
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:39,990
makes it more difficult or

523
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:44,490
time-consuming for the attacker to put

524
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:48,090
something together it does increase the

525
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:49,649
cost not exponentially but there is an

526
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:55,350
increase possible and since you have to

527
00:28:49,649 --> 00:28:58,459
buy more equipment and also they would

528
00:28:55,350 --> 00:29:04,800
probably be more persons involved

529
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:06,630
and based on what you're doing if you're

530
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,700
doing that improve and yes it's not a

531
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:10,380
big deal if you're not doing an approved

532
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:13,790
pen test it would probably be a big

533
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:16,800
reveal another thing you can do is

534
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:19,950
random probing so remember earlier from

535
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:22,770
the data shoot the pulses were sound

536
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:26,400
with regularity we're at regular rate

537
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:27,870
demerit so the module who went in when

538
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,870
the pulses were going to come back into

539
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:33,719
expect them and put the data points in

540
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:37,320
it's an internal matter so another thing

541
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:39,900
you can do instead of the fixed interval

542
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,429
change that up down if you're an

543
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:44,010
attacker that'll give you a headache

544
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:50,730
trying to figure out unless you're able

545
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:55,950
to get scan it and receive enough of the

546
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:57,980
pulses from the unit so you know what

547
00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:01,070
the protocol is

548
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:04,080
but again that's another staff and

549
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:07,350
usually bad actors are looking for the

550
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:10,409
low-hanging fruit not to put extreme

551
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:11,590
amount of time into it you know unless

552
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:15,549
they're looking

553
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:18,509
it's a payment like that yeah bixie

554
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:18,509
technical

555
00:30:19,309 --> 00:30:26,600
okay so that's a Collider we're gonna go

556
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:29,159
into GPS GPS has been around for decades

557
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:36,600
literally decades it's been used by the

558
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:39,179
DoD since um police say he's the old GPS

559
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:42,659
units but I was in service for these big

560
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:45,960
monsters that took a huge battery change

561
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:47,370
of battery battery like regularly so it

562
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,250
was a hassle when you're in the field

563
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:52,799
can all this extra weight but with

564
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:57,720
vehicles it's a relatively new

565
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:59,580
application it has been opted for a few

566
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:04,020
years but not a lot of people have been

567
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:06,360
exposed to it and there are still people

568
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:10,260
who are mistaken about it and its uses

569
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:12,928
that would hold here GPS spoofing I

570
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:16,158
should I have I can say hi happy for

571
00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:18,690
Parkinson's or Wilson another habitable

572
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,880
GPS spoofing is quite a complex

573
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:22,620
procedure involves broadcasting

574
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:28,440
incorrect real

575
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:32,189
energy signals mislead GPS receivers the

576
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:35,940
quote in the white house delgo

577
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:39,180
although this is a relatively new

578
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:45,360
application the tool isn't new

579
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:47,550
the attack vector is someone who

580
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:53,939
cheap fun of us as fun as you can make

581
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:55,020
GPS right so the vehicle has to be aware

582
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,850
of the surroundings at all times

583
00:31:55,020 --> 00:32:00,570
especially the eight deep vehicles you

584
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:03,300
don't want to be in a car fully

585
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:05,389
autonomous driving around hoping it

586
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:07,800
knows where it's going

587
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:09,480
that's like a wish sandwich

588
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,889
it's not gonna work out very well for

589
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,970
you the thieves know where the other

590
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:19,110
cars are the road is pedestrians trees

591
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:21,929
everything what I was going through this

592
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:23,760
I remembered watching the office about a

593
00:32:21,929 --> 00:32:28,650
year ago two years ago one of the three

594
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:31,559
rocks and they gave an example of what

595
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:36,360
can happen what can happen once you get

596
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:38,700
bad GPS so they were driving to an old

597
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,590
clients place an attorney's office and

598
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,840
they didn't know where it was so they

599
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:45,510
just plug the coordinates into their GPS

600
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:50,669
and so the driving along a necessity

601
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:51,900
variety and so the other guy says no no

602
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:53,970
there's a pond there you don't have to

603
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:58,170
take a like it's like no the GPS estatoe

604
00:32:53,970 --> 00:33:00,000
right so they take the right you've been

605
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:03,470
doing that horrible the sort of

606
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,470
disservice is funny when you're watching

607
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:11,169
so this is an isolated issue GPS

608
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:13,929
spoofing is kind of a big deal this

609
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:15,850
story was out of the staple just this

610
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:24,640
last evening first that wasn't on April

611
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:26,949
Fool's joke they they quasi busted doing

612
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:29,800
the GPS spoofing there's the there's a

613
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:31,960
site for it and I'm not trying to do be

614
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,129
a but personal fear uncertainty and

615
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,130
doubt

616
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:38,380
I was published by the third-party

617
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:42,070
respective time and just in case what I

618
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:48,600
did was I found other sources for the

619
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:52,570
same story different BBC that's nice

620
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:54,939
independent source so this the spoofing

621
00:33:52,570 --> 00:34:00,730
is going on by nations by nation states

622
00:33:54,940 --> 00:34:02,500
but also by people so as I mentioned the

623
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:05,460
vehicle needs that know its location at

624
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:07,510
all times you don't want any surprises

625
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:12,820
surprise when you're driving a vehicle

626
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:16,270
like that is really bad a couple issues

627
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:20,290
that maybe with a signal are the eye on

628
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:24,639
the ionosphere may not be conducive to

629
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:26,290
GPS because this satellite also large

630
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,029
buildings like your your downtown

631
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:32,440
Chicago they could block some of the

632
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:34,950
signal there also happens to be the

633
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:39,720
attackers out there looking

634
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:41,250
several theories all at the same time so

635
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:45,058
here's some of the equipment if you

636
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:48,389
wanted to do it so this is based on

637
00:34:45,059 --> 00:34:54,809
research a makeup that I also work with

638
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:58,349
them on this it's not costly or

639
00:34:54,809 --> 00:35:02,520
cumbersome to spoof GPS and really mess

640
00:34:58,349 --> 00:35:07,349
with people the assembly isn't tough you

641
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:10,799
can see Sophie or SDR software-defined

642
00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:13,170
radio if you use a hand RF for a planer

643
00:35:10,799 --> 00:35:16,380
out and there's pictures of both of

644
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:18,329
those from the manufacturer there you

645
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:21,119
want some headache case it's like a

646
00:35:18,329 --> 00:35:24,480
plastic case became a 3d printed if you

647
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:27,210
want light so you don't get by up and

648
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,270
then ten up the antenna and the upper

649
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:34,069
right that's just a stock photo you'd

650
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:38,569
probably want to use something better

651
00:35:34,069 --> 00:35:38,569
for this type of attack of different

652
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:45,490
and a Linux OS and Cody encoding the

653
00:35:43,299 --> 00:35:49,660
scripts for it's not that bad either you

654
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:52,479
can download if you want and what we

655
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:55,660
would what we like to do we've given a

656
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:58,839
presentation a few times is that we are

657
00:35:55,660 --> 00:36:03,368
location so it's in Russia a hundred

658
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:05,680
metres above Chernobyl so somehow we

659
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:08,109
were able if you want to believe GPS in

660
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:11,399
that case we able to put a car 100

661
00:36:08,109 --> 00:36:15,069
meters in the air above the old reactors

662
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:17,619
and we weren't in Russian what we do is

663
00:36:15,069 --> 00:36:20,109
ready Irene only spoofing one satellite

664
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:25,109
or one one satellite use it depends if

665
00:36:20,109 --> 00:36:30,930
you're using the later on up the top one

666
00:36:25,109 --> 00:36:33,880
what you can do is go low Eden was

667
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:36,399
depending on the proximity we use an

668
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:40,359
amplifier or not but what you can't do

669
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:43,420
is use two of those and do look to the

670
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:45,880
new model I think you can do if use two

671
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:47,470
of them for satellites because he would

672
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,940
need at least four in order for

673
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:51,399
something to consider the amount of the

674
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:54,180
position well what we did was in the

675
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:57,690
presentation we were so close really

676
00:36:54,180 --> 00:37:02,140
where we were at really couldn't elastic

677
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:04,509
so we just used the laptop he didn't

678
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:10,359
amplify it but everybody was so close

679
00:37:04,509 --> 00:37:13,150
that the signal especially an iPhone

680
00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:17,288
would read that we were in Russia like

681
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:19,660
with the with the Android it would pick

682
00:37:17,289 --> 00:37:22,390
that up and the signals so strong it

683
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:23,529
would use that it's more than the other

684
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:26,830
seven

685
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:28,450
pick up you can't establish the position

686
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:31,230
in the geometry unless you have an

687
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:33,640
intersection of you need one one

688
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:34,710
latitude longitude point because you're

689
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:37,359
here

690
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:39,760
your position is dependent on the

691
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:41,560
intersection of you know this satellites

692
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,440
here the satellites are satellites here

693
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:46,060
and here or the intercepts yeah what

694
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:49,350
else will depends on the strength of the

695
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:51,720
signal it's not just it's the number

696
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:54,040
because you can have you can ever have

697
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:56,879
that shows all the different satellites

698
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:59,790
are picking up with the would be

699
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:03,940
reception of each of the power of each

700
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:05,680
yeah but I mean they've written bad

701
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:07,420
software they think they could determine

702
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,419
the location with just a line of sight

703
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:14,340
from one from the angle and the distance

704
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:17,080
from one yeah one satellite yeah but

705
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:19,210
when we were doing it would especially

706
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:24,069
with iPhones we would pick up the back

707
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:27,790
was the location I'm using just the yeah

708
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:31,060
lay down that interesting a lot of GPS

709
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:32,980
receivers he's going to to get a low

710
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:35,910
precision because it needs three points

711
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,910
of intersection they used

712
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:42,920
so it depends yeah yeah nothing that I

713
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:46,880
understood

714
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:51,200
I mean fly flying but yeah there

715
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,579
shouldn't be a ballot position but we

716
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,038
were doing that they were peeking out of

717
00:38:52,579 --> 00:38:57,309
picking up on their phone and

718
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:59,210
specifically with the iPhones they were

719
00:38:57,309 --> 00:39:03,039
still showing me they were in Russia

720
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:03,039
over the word hour that's interesting

721
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:11,000
yeah yeah to be able to do a tap like

722
00:39:09,529 --> 00:39:12,470
that you need to know like you're on

723
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,200
because they're going to get things

724
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:18,709
right or do something that you know we

725
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:22,930
do we just put the new whatever new

726
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:22,930
location we want that's all what we use

727
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:33,950
okay another thing we did he showed out

728
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:38,990
was that you know the putting my cocaine

729
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:41,689
in a few years ago and when you get the

730
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:46,390
little Angus creatures whatever they're

731
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:52,520
called I'm too busy

732
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:55,520
but so Nick was able to just sit in this

733
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,900
living room change of coordinates and he

734
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,770
was able to got all the pokemon

735
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:04,210
creatures he said within a couple hours

736
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:04,210
just by sitting on his couch watching

737
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:09,470
these shows this is how we had a see

738
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:12,140
showed his daughter how they're doing

739
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:15,140
too and so he doubted the Pokemon

740
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:17,410
Pokemon whatever for his kid to the same

741
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,410
time

742
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:23,980
so the methodology for the attack

743
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:27,790
doesn't step it's technology advances so

744
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:34,690
does the attack salute the attacks we're

745
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:36,430
working at different types of attack so

746
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:38,380
you can change the coordinates to think

747
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:40,600
the vehicles in the Long Lane so it goes

748
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:46,050
to try to correct itself into the other

749
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:49,390
traffic in Ventura my 75 which is the

750
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:51,490
Duan FD way out during the morning you

751
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:56,140
know at night as people drive in north

752
00:40:51,490 --> 00:41:00,990
in the Detroit that could really get

753
00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:05,290
yours for an external attack if you were

754
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:09,790
so inclined what you can do is just sit

755
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:12,850
by the side of the road and use two

756
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:16,680
three late hours and that proves the

757
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:19,900
location that may not be as drastic now

758
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:22,720
but think about it in 10 years we have

759
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:25,360
more 80 vehicles on the road if you want

760
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,930
to mess with a whole fleet in the same

761
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,930
location

762
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:38,650
and this is one of the things we did we

763
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:43,000
may have done this we may or may not

764
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:46,300
have at FCC approval so without an ample

765
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:50,080
fighter just an antenna on the roof of

766
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:52,600
the building we had we had a good life

767
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:56,860
with farad had a Faraday cage around

768
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:58,810
three sides the cement we didn't have a

769
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:03,880
Faraday cage under that we had to have

770
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:05,770
one pull through the roof and we were

771
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:08,790
able to go about a quarter mile away and

772
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:11,140
still pick up the signal just one laptop

773
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:15,250
with the normal ten that we didn't

774
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:18,009
amplify it one just a baseline reading

775
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:22,540
so we're about a quarter mile away line

776
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:24,310
of sight and the signal still from that

777
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:27,100
was stronger than the other seven

778
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:29,830
satellite she was picking up so if you

779
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:34,330
really wanted to get excited with

780
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:38,200
amplify try and reach even further this

781
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:39,450
could this could affect planes vehicles

782
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,540
ships

783
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:46,350
phones drones virtual anything use some

784
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:51,080
GPS you can affect this and again don't

785
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:51,080
try this unless your office

786
00:42:53,120 --> 00:43:00,150
so something defenses you can build a

787
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:03,690
defense that's perfect

788
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:07,040
that will exclude any attack but it will

789
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:10,680
cost too much that will make the vehicle

790
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:15,450
difficult to operate so you have to find

791
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:17,580
some happy medium with this you have to

792
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:20,910
have finding practical defense that you

793
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:23,340
can implement to a fleet for instance to

794
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:25,500
GM we have to find something that Jim

795
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:32,190
for instance would want to use garlic

796
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:35,310
vehicles so what options used to GPS

797
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:37,050
antennas a whole summer not rope not

798
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:41,029
close to each other the vehicle was

799
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:43,350
separated out on two different bands

800
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:49,200
with that that will give you enough of a

801
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:51,480
differential so that that'll be a valid

802
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:53,339
defense so if you have a fed-up if you

803
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:57,510
are being attacked because the system

804
00:43:53,340 --> 00:44:02,130
should be able to go direct monitoring

805
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:05,220
this is this is one of the ones that

806
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:08,160
I've been pushing more so if you're

807
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:09,470
driving along this is your Dearborn GPSS

808
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,230
from Dearborn

809
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:16,040
Dearborn and Mississippi there's a

810
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:21,260
problem so just for this few lines of

811
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:24,140
code within the module the entry can't

812
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:26,390
it should be able to pick up where

813
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:29,960
there's an air we because obviously you

814
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:32,359
can't drive to Dearborn Michigan to say

815
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:36,140
Mississippi Mississippi within a few

816
00:44:32,359 --> 00:44:38,210
minutes so in that case that rhythm

817
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:40,848
would pick it up and say oh there's a

818
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:44,390
problem and go to some of the other

819
00:44:40,849 --> 00:44:47,150
modules I recommend and data you know

820
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:50,828
that's more the data points and depth so

821
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:50,829
the vehicle known for it several times

822
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:58,810
and can't drive from Dallas Department

823
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,810
so it's literally all good

824
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:12,229
janitor basic tax oh yeah there's so

825
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:17,299
letters are so many hardware to buy

826
00:45:12,229 --> 00:45:21,140
passes it's expensive it's really

827
00:45:17,299 --> 00:45:28,670
expensive and probably not something Joe

828
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:32,868
Hazzard would buy spectral subtraction

829
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:35,239
model that's another based so you have

830
00:45:32,869 --> 00:45:38,210
how basically works is you have a

831
00:45:35,239 --> 00:45:40,279
baseline signal you look at the other

832
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:45,079
signal coming in you look at the

833
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:48,229
differential if one of the other signals

834
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:50,809
is vastly above that with above your

835
00:45:48,229 --> 00:45:52,609
margin of error then you know then the

836
00:45:50,809 --> 00:45:56,630
vehicle knows something's going on

837
00:45:52,609 --> 00:45:58,880
somebody's trying to attack the GPS in

838
00:45:56,630 --> 00:46:03,640
vehicle that's another algorithm based

839
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,640
check like the drift of the plausibility

840
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:15,270
so this just came in the other day from

841
00:46:09,869 --> 00:46:17,580
Regulus apparently and I wasn't able to

842
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:20,340
get any data so this is a another

843
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:22,549
disclaimer but this is just from that

844
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:26,070
reckless Regulus has a product that

845
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:28,410
allegedly will defend against GPS attack

846
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:31,590
I haven't had a chance to look at any

847
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:33,649
other white papers any of the data uh it

848
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:37,380
was just a lot of marketing buzzwords

849
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:41,250
for the email so if it may work you

850
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:44,609
think that I don't know you know it's

851
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:47,910
like when the marketing people come out

852
00:46:44,609 --> 00:46:50,160
say they have AI and the product right

853
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:52,500
vendors are taking on I think I should

854
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:55,160
ask a few more questions but the

855
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,160
salesperson

856
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:04,570
but this is that's one of the really

857
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:06,640
products that's out there both say with

858
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:09,820
you have questions concerns please get a

859
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:13,600
hold of me always going to do sir yeah

860
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:16,960
so for aviation and it doesn't cost all

861
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:19,480
and I think they're probably what less

862
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:24,430
than fifty bucks for a wasp receiver for

863
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:25,890
Raspberry Pi so that's a correction

864
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:29,859
signal and sent from a mine base

865
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:32,049
terminal its retransmitted from the GPS

866
00:47:29,859 --> 00:47:34,660
satellites and you can receive that and

867
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:36,520
that you were spoofing and claiming that

868
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:39,520
your satellite number such and such

869
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:41,470
great and you receive with integrity

870
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:44,259
signal is the authentic beat you check

871
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:46,118
against right that's that's really an

872
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:48,510
expensive would be anything for people

873
00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:51,670
to put that in a car think one or two

874
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:53,650
yeah that would be cheap too cheap and

875
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:54,970
pretty easy to put it yeah and it's

876
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:58,900
already built in it's built into the

877
00:47:54,970 --> 00:48:00,790
National Airspace System I mean like you

878
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:02,880
know just talk when you can get one of

879
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:06,640
those for a raspberry

880
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:09,730
on top yeah what's it called walks wide

881
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:13,930
area augmentation system okay and it's a

882
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:18,210
signal to broadcasting right now yeah

883
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:18,210
I've only looked at mostly the vehicle

884
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:25,629
yeah but you could play with it doesn't

885
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:29,440
cost much to explain that yeah thanks

886
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:30,280
are there any other like tertiary other

887
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,640
ways

888
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:37,420
normal acacia mews for cars I'm just

889
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:41,790
thinking of like Tiger agents

890
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:45,210
yeah the avenues and cell phone towers

891
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:45,210
and they have

892
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:52,569
they have specific cell phone

893
00:48:53,539 --> 00:49:00,829
or we're going there are specific cell

894
00:48:56,630 --> 00:49:04,309
phone towers that are trying to mated

895
00:49:00,829 --> 00:49:08,139
with the vehicle train feelings with at

896
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:08,139
specific sites

897
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,859
so it's not all

898
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:20,180
deston

899
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:25,430
but then that's further I was going for

900
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:30,529
the vehicles maybe we worked it we're

901
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:34,899
testing them now entire vehicles of the

902
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:37,370
modules but it's with the stove being

903
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:40,010
you know two kisses but like I said for

904
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:43,250
decades we've been use them forever but

905
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:46,400
be in vehicles there's still a lot of

906
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:49,340
learning to be done and we unfortunately

907
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:53,120
are in the street we're not cross

908
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:54,560
pollinating ideas for some reason we all

909
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:56,750
think that we're all smarter than

910
00:49:54,560 --> 00:50:00,460
everybody else and we all want to

911
00:49:56,750 --> 00:50:06,740
recreate the wheel for ourselves you

912
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:07,820
know between IP management they're

913
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:11,509
different there are better ways to

914
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:14,230
handle the issue and how we're actually

915
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:14,230
handling

916
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:23,950
but that's where we're at so Ford said

917
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:26,890
Ruth they have their ad vehicle next to

918
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:27,879
you and 2021 they said and this was a

919
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:30,310
computer stuff

920
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:32,310
we'll have our ad vehicle out there for

921
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:35,490
you to drive we're going to sell it

922
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:40,660
bus words and everything but there are

923
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:44,430
94 or EMW music ends - they're not even

924
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:50,970
right together but when it comes down

925
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:54,899
it's coming now probably not like

926
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:57,549
they'll be they'll be 80 vehicles oh I

927
00:50:54,900 --> 00:51:00,220
think you think and thanks for coming

928
00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:02,260
out to the conference of time as a

929
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:06,930
commodity the older I get the more I

930
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:06,930
appreciate time so thanks for coming out

931
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:13,379
[Applause]
