1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,380
a professor at University of

2
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:30,570
Pennsylvania lately his research has

3
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,308
been the use of light controllers and

4
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,760
the small button computers for

5
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:38,070
apprentice and penetration tester he's

6
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,670
published multiple books on forensics

7
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:45,239
and testing and is a recognized expert

8
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:48,480
many areas specifically partner acting

9
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:51,780
forensics and heavy networks of old are

10
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,599
replaces the sheriff challenge has been

11
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:59,030
all over the world including places like

12
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,030
black at DEFCON become presentations and

13
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:15,560
that is three times family without you

14
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:18,140
and by the way heard the announcement

15
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,509
tomorrow we're gonna try the weather's

16
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:28,580
okay jump out of some planes so you're

17
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:31,220
interested to that I'm not going to be

18
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:33,649
flying then he told me no he said we

19
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:37,220
were building airplanes oh I have built

20
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:40,399
airplanes I know I don't have many and

21
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:49,549
are the game not an RV I built a poor

22
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:53,240
man's army Zenith okay 6:01 so yeah you

23
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:54,709
know why are we having this talk part of

24
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,059
the reason we're having this talk is you

25
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:59,720
know there's a lot of people out there

26
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:02,690
that like make claims you know this is

27
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,980
something that happens and then kind of

28
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:06,399
dies down for a while and happens again

29
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:10,700
[Applause]

30
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,880
so as was mentioned you know sometimes

31
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:13,709
people are like

32
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:17,700
it'll say things like a pretty good a

33
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,240
forensics guy I'd like my page on my

34
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,869
team

35
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,420
and one of only six to do forensics

36
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:28,020
programs that has big tennis a center of

37
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:32,010
academic excellence stand so that that's

38
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:34,080
not interest to you companies due to my

39
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,859
university we don't have a shortage of

40
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,260
students

41
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:48,030
honestly the we're really working you

42
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:54,989
know like three hundred majors and we're

43
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:59,840
limited by the bandwidth is there a way

44
00:02:54,990 --> 00:03:03,900
we can get these lights off you know

45
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,840
it's just like shining right on yes

46
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:11,420
screams but I think there's like a 200

47
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,420
watt bulb rejecter

48
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,690
all the way like that better little

49
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:23,790
scooter realness

50
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:24,690
alright so yeah I fitted mediator for a

51
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:29,280
long time

52
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:32,069
I have 17 days and coming correctly all

53
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:38,480
mcaren commercial pilot flight

54
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:41,910
instructor of the year just name and

55
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:45,149
airplane inspector there from mechanic

56
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:47,160
avionics technician I've worked on some

57
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:51,030
of the avionics that are pertinent to

58
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:54,060
some of the airliner discussions you

59
00:03:51,030 --> 00:04:03,060
thousand hours of flight time skydiver

60
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:09,870
it's got a coach again so yeah I've got

61
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:10,860
a little bit of work in this area some

62
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:15,569
of the things we're going to talk about

63
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:21,329
one today some common aircraft system

64
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:23,990
say it's like B is B it is a a cars

65
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:27,660
things like that by the way I apologize

66
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,320
that these slides have been mutilated a

67
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:34,320
little bit

68
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:40,370
I play Microsoft and the fact that I was

69
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,370
trying to present this on my laptop

70
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:49,948
so this has got

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:02,259
it also looks like we have a glorious

72
00:04:49,949 --> 00:05:04,360
4:3 format projections okay sometimes

73
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:06,039
people talk about when it comes

74
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,220
airliners they talk about things like

75
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:12,280
hacking into the avionics bio

76
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:17,319
entertainment networks actively feeding

77
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:19,179
a new system with eight cars the system

78
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:23,169
I don't know what that is it's basically

79
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:26,789
a messaging system between the aircraft

80
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:26,789
and the ground

81
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:34,080
primarily it's between the aircraft and

82
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:38,979
the airline but there are some other

83
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:41,740
messages as well that are used that are

84
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:43,270
sentinel addresses all right so I want

85
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:47,770
you guys to know you heard it here first

86
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:49,479
this is a one-day airline the top it's

87
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:53,680
not a zero day because it happened

88
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:57,610
yesterday so I discovered this attack

89
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:02,889
and i'm calling this attack a spear

90
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:05,349
smashing attack so this is my luggage as

91
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:10,449
I collected it at the Moline Airport

92
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:13,240
yesterday morning and your funny thing

93
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:16,719
is I didn't have the other picture but

94
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:21,669
the good side of this heart

95
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:24,039
chill bag was of course facing up on the

96
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:25,810
conveyor belt and I come down the

97
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:28,300
conveyor belt line all someone's got a

98
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:30,310
bag looks like minded oh my oh wait you

99
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,380
know I I put all these stickers on my

100
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,639
bag just to identify it easily right

101
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,580
because you've all been there

102
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:39,699
at the baggage claim there's 50 bags and

103
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:41,770
look just like your bag unless it's some

104
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:44,930
bizarre

105
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:49,450
this one back then I picked it up and at

106
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:53,390
first I didn't look too bad and then I

107
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:57,530
turned it around and I'm like you know

108
00:06:53,390 --> 00:07:00,020
then I saw this corner here it was just

109
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:02,210
a little bit smushed in the corner and

110
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:10,549
then I turned around and I saw this and

111
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:12,620
I'm like wow spear smashing what is that

112
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,940
does that work for you guys they could

113
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,000
name

114
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:20,380
I was targeted actually why what was

115
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,380
targeted by United

116
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:31,200
you know did you fly through air I did

117
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:33,480
they use it as a stuck thing and it's

118
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:45,719
almost level loaded the bags that you

119
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:47,940
stepped on yours was hey that it will

120
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:51,420
give you a nice el cheapo $50 bag in

121
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:57,290
replacement the nice thing about this is

122
00:07:51,420 --> 00:08:01,740
that I had a sky diving helmet inside

123
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:07,530
which was unharmed so I don't know if

124
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:11,850
it's because they got nest or because it

125
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:21,690
was a nice carbon-fiber helmet detector

126
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:24,740
day yeah just real quickly something I

127
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:28,650
can get out out of the way right way

128
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:29,190
when it comes to attacking any kind of

129
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:32,429
aircraft

130
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:34,229
you can't override the highlight if

131
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:40,969
you're overriding the pilot then you're

132
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:43,800
probably and all airplanes have

133
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:46,100
unethical mechanical backup systems

134
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:50,349
backup instruments

135
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:52,580
so if you seen it at my door T's talks

136
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,800
it's got to talk I think in the last

137
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:57,860
time slot today in the and the room

138
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:01,849
across the hall he flies and airplanes

139
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:05,710
got Galactus a cockpit but it still has

140
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:08,510
back up old-school instruments now I

141
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:11,090
won't guarantee you that Mike knows how

142
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:13,939
to use those but I'll just say they're

143
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:17,900
good and that's sometimes a problem we

144
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:21,440
get people that came up with only the

145
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:25,010
electronic stuff and then they're like

146
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,540
have to revert to the non electronic

147
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:29,330
stuff and they're like I don't remember

148
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:33,050
her ever had to learn the flange being

149
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:36,470
gauges yeah yeah I had a friend who was

150
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:38,390
an airline pilot and one time he was

151
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:41,420
telling me this story say something

152
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:46,520
failed and his airliner and he's like I

153
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:49,430
was able to dial in a meal bar and you

154
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,860
know select the radio to fly if you

155
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:52,560
don't

156
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:56,430
or as it's a radio beginning basically

157
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,140
he's selected to force to fly to live

158
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,390
from this radio game if he's super proud

159
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:03,960
of himself for me nothing would do that

160
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:07,080
I'm like wow and how much money you get

161
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:11,130
paid to fly these airplanes are I

162
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:13,830
thought it is kind of funny but I agree

163
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:17,460
learning on steam gauges is going I

164
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:22,830
teach a lot in a flying club in

165
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:28,650
Bloomsburg our club just bought a 1960s

166
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:33,050
map it has nothing but steam gauges it

167
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:36,180
does not have GPS and it has two analog

168
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:39,930
radians so they have the mechanical

169
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:42,569
tuners and I'm like hey let's go do some

170
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:47,250
busy airspace and this and just see how

171
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:49,740
all my students do I love it nice we

172
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:52,310
also have a newer SAS though that's got

173
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,310
all the fancy

174
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:05,110
maybe enough to get licensed checked out

175
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:07,120
you can possibly affect an autopilot if

176
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:09,730
the pilot notices they're going to

177
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:15,100
disconnect the autopilot hopefully they

178
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:17,950
know this did something here and you

179
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,480
should know that anything you do with an

180
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:23,110
airliner at least it's probably gonna

181
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:27,970
need to alert going off in the cockpit

182
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:32,320
also the auto pilots by regulation have

183
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:35,020
to be able to be overridden by a pipe so

184
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,550
you have a 90 pound supermodel who's

185
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:42,780
also an airline pilot in her spare time

186
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:46,089
maybe that big model so she has very fun

187
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:49,540
she has to be able to do things like get

188
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:52,870
this the only mistake is coming back she

189
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:55,000
has to be able to lean all 490 pounds on

190
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:58,750
that stick

191
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,700
so there are multiple things that a

192
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:07,660
pilot can do to overcome any

193
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:11,150
that's tough now this time a little bit

194
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:13,640
and just kind of I love about it about

195
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:16,819
some of the airliners and some of the

196
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:20,660
things that they have the older drivers

197
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:24,290
use something called ARINC 429 and this

198
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:30,969
is a network standard that interconnects

199
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:35,030
avionics systems ARINC 429 requires

200
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:38,140
specialized artwork and because of that

201
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:42,050
they're like hey the whole world uses

202
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:44,540
Ethernet and Ethernet chips archieved

203
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:49,520
even that connectors are cheap it's well

204
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:52,510
understood technology so let's start

205
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:55,689
using that so we're not paying as much

206
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:58,790
for all the specialized equipment and

207
00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:04,790
they use a modified version of Ethernet

208
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:07,420
known as ARINC 664 or AMT s been putting

209
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,420
away airplane

210
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:16,579
so what is this life it's built on

211
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:19,190
internet what it's not your father's

212
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:20,450
either right you can't just start

213
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:23,840
sending packets

214
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:27,200
it's never wireless that's the other

215
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:30,200
thing even if you have a big honkin

216
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,600
bowling and it's got a massive wingspan

217
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,670
you like wouldn't they be great if I

218
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,860
didn't have to run the wire all the way

219
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:39,380
up to that wing you're gonna run a wire

220
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:44,860
to that way you're not going to rely on

221
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:49,370
wireless anything in that aircraft okay

222
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:52,150
there is some security in place this

223
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:54,890
stuff is not connected things like

224
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:59,270
entertainment systems it's not connected

225
00:13:54,890 --> 00:14:02,360
to inflight Wi-Fi so it's internet but

226
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:06,920
that doesn't automatically mean oh I can

227
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:10,130
just do stuff with so again it's based

228
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:13,130
on Eric's 629 I was first created by

229
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:16,930
going for the triple 7 allows the use of

230
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:21,020
cots common off-the-shelf components

231
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:23,829
it's not proprietary some of the

232
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:25,970
differences uses redundant channels

233
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:29,270
you're not going to find something

234
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:33,290
important and an aviation that has like

235
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:36,189
one channel or one wire that one wire

236
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:41,920
breaks things are not

237
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:47,110
but we don't like that so what it does

238
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:49,240
is it also assigns time slices to avoid

239
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:54,189
collisions and to make things too

240
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:58,959
deterministic tcp/ip beautiful

241
00:14:54,189 --> 00:15:04,089
technology everybody uses it but here's

242
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:06,729
the problem tcp/ip I sent a packet if

243
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:10,689
it's UDP I don't even know if that

244
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:13,209
packet or all right hopefully hopefully

245
00:15:10,689 --> 00:15:18,519
you're not you didn't get it maybe you

246
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:21,670
wanna stack well even with IP the issue

247
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:26,800
is how long does it take for that pocket

248
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:28,839
to go from here to here don't know why

249
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:33,339
don't I know biggest reason they don't

250
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:36,490
know is collisions Oh two people try to

251
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:41,079
talk at once by the way how many of you

252
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:43,430
in here are pilots from any one of you

253
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:45,199
pilot

254
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:48,680
come to Pennsylvania for a couple

255
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:51,440
reasons I can't get a boat 170 wanted an

256
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,329
instructor be- to be above 0 gallons of

257
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:58,010
fuel so it's expensive for me to get my

258
00:15:53,330 --> 00:16:02,650
license that can be an issue I actually

259
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:02,650
just did someone's license in 20 days

260
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:10,160
sure her story is to the NASA engineer

261
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:12,320
she's between assignments so to speak

262
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,819
where she's being assigned to Russia

263
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,820
waiting for paperwork

264
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:22,640
she's like I'm home with my folks for a

265
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:25,130
couple of weeks I always want to get my

266
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,710
life sentence can you help me out here

267
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:30,680
so I blew it with her home blah and that

268
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:35,570
went through withdrawal when we stopped

269
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:38,290
flying and that flying at least four

270
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:41,440
hours today is horrible

271
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,439
so yeah

272
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:47,699
it's collision so like the reason I

273
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:49,890
asked about the pilot thing is when you

274
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:52,830
talked on the radio only one person

275
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:54,569
could talk on the radio at once so as

276
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:56,970
pilots like if you're going into an

277
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:58,620
uncontrolled field you know you'll say

278
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,940
the name of the field you'll say what

279
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,530
you're going to say and you say that

280
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,810
they can feel at the end part of the

281
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:06,149
reason that you do that is so that if

282
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:08,429
you get blocked by somebody bill at

283
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:10,579
least you know they'll hear runway

284
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:12,270
two-seven and then they'll hear

285
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:15,020
Bloomsburg at the end

286
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:16,770
oh well that's blue spring put on that

287
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:19,260
otherwise they get a little worried

288
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:20,970
there on final for runway two-seven in

289
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,410
their report and they hear somebody

290
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,730
talking about being on final four to

291
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:30,120
seven and they're like looking around

292
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:34,290
woman so the same thing is true with our

293
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:36,209
IP transmissions so what they do is they

294
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:40,770
time slicing and everyone gets their

295
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:44,070
times once and they use virtual links so

296
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:48,420
virtually is basically the unit

297
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:51,860
directional pipe you have one and only

298
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:54,660
one senator and one or more receivers

299
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:58,320
and we use time slicing we use something

300
00:17:54,660 --> 00:18:00,330
called a bandwidth allocation gap that

301
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,340
determines the size the time slice

302
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,919
how big are the package you need to send

303
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:07,610
on this network if they're bigger your

304
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:10,320
constant slice is bigger

305
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:13,889
well what happens when the time slice is

306
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:17,490
bigger you have to wait longer right

307
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:19,880
because there's more than one senator on

308
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,880
the snap

309
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:26,160
and you have jitter they talk about

310
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,950
jitter it's like the maximum latency

311
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,990
minus the minimum latency and it's

312
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:37,160
determined by the number of virtual

313
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:37,160
links and by the family allocation bag

314
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:46,680
kind of see this so it's a redundant

315
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:50,250
system you have an a network and a V

316
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:55,140
Network and then you have your Mac layer

317
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:59,270
stuff integrity checking redundancy

318
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:02,190
management basically here in this system

319
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:07,500
whoever gets their pocket there first

320
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:09,840
wins so it's a redundant system and

321
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,360
here's what I mean when I said ok you

322
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,580
can generate alerts if you start mucking

323
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,870
about with us you're like oh I'm just

324
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:18,659
going to connect one of these networks

325
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:21,000
and since the bogus packet well guess

326
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:23,100
what pretty quickly you're going to get

327
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,920
alerts in the cockpit going there's a

328
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:30,060
broken wire you need to send this sucker

329
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:32,190
for maintenance right because if one

330
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:35,190
wire is pro maybe the other one is gonna

331
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:37,520
break free so very close proximity to

332
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,520
each other

333
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:44,460
and again another picture and the X

334
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:48,190
connections you have the two channels

335
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:50,530
and it's connected now here's the other

336
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:53,950
thing there is no equivalent to a

337
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:57,100
crossover cable and these suckers

338
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:59,410
you must go through an avionics switch

339
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:05,230
and I've actually worked on easy on the

340
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:08,050
switches and the avionics which is a

341
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:09,310
switch it's not a hub right you guys

342
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:12,280
know the difference between a column

343
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:15,159
gonna switch up anything comes in it

344
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:18,370
just stupidly goes blast blast blast and

345
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:22,360
report in a switch says oh this is your

346
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:26,649
packet I'll send it to you every

347
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:30,429
connection left switch is programmed so

348
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:35,200
if I try to send bogus messages on port

349
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:39,130
2 into that switch and say I am this

350
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:42,010
sensor that's connected to port 5 that

351
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:46,420
switch is gonna say and it's

352
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:50,560
not gonna forward my packets because for

353
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:53,170
five or for two is not allowed to send

354
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,940
packets to this other point is that the

355
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:58,990
simple just sending the address from the

356
00:20:54,940 --> 00:21:01,930
device on it's like a free every virtual

357
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:02,770
link it's probably it's pretty

358
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,870
complicated

359
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:07,570
depending on the version of AFD actually

360
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:09,639
working - I can't just plug something in

361
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:12,220
and we'll discover that power aircraft

362
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:14,050
power on these have to be specifically

363
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,760
there's definitely hard-coded into the

364
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:18,580
firmware on the ones there's not like

365
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,970
the mCP or nothing equivalent to that I

366
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:23,980
expect that yeah so every single link

367
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:26,410
it's programmed so you know that's

368
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:28,270
barrier number one so people like all

369
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,350
like you said I can just connect my

370
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:31,879
laptop and like Ethernet this

371
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:33,678
we'll send baggage messages through the

372
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,840
in-flight Wi-Fi and all the other you

373
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,940
know we'll talk about that a little bit

374
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,470
by the way in case you're wondering I'll

375
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:42,409
give you a little preview that's sort of

376
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:47,690
low chair you can't do that we'll talk

377
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:50,299
about why you can't another just sub

378
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:54,320
part of the diagram for airliner and say

379
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:55,039
which one you have things like the

380
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,809
joystick

381
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,429
she used to fly the plane you have a

382
00:21:56,809 --> 00:22:00,950
primary flight display and a

383
00:21:58,429 --> 00:22:04,580
multi-function display primary flight

384
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:06,590
display is like the big screen that

385
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:08,779
shows you which ways up and how fast

386
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:11,990
you're going to if you're banking and

387
00:22:08,779 --> 00:22:13,730
things like that often don't show like

388
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:17,389
synthetic vision we call it I'll show

389
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:20,210
you what that looks like and

390
00:22:17,389 --> 00:22:22,758
multifunction display is multifunction

391
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:24,049
they can display and your Diagnostics

392
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:27,409
can this buy a whole bunch of stuff

393
00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:30,918
you're routing things like that and a

394
00:22:27,409 --> 00:22:34,190
lot of these things tied into a flight

395
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:36,320
management system computer and you'll

396
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:39,710
notice that a lot of these links are

397
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:44,870
one-way some of them are in yellow which

398
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:46,580
are two-way really it's two links but

399
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:51,070
you know for the schematic it's just

400
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:55,070
easier to draw it's one

401
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:59,029
bidirectional the range of this remote

402
00:22:55,070 --> 00:23:06,939
is like two I can practically just walk

403
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:09,559
over okay let's talk a little bit about

404
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:15,009
entertainment system so some people out

405
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:18,649
there have been like hey I can use the

406
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:20,570
entertainment system at my seat and I'm

407
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:23,359
gonna connect all the way into that

408
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:25,599
avionics boss and I'm gonna wreak havoc

409
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:30,129
and I'm going to take over this plane

410
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:35,090
using either my laptop or my smartphone

411
00:23:30,129 --> 00:23:37,728
and here's a basic level why this

412
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:43,220
doesn't work and why do I have a picture

413
00:23:37,729 --> 00:23:45,830
of VGA point it's essentially similar to

414
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:50,299
trying to hack a computer through the

415
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:52,158
VGA port I'm not saying you could cause

416
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:56,570
bad things you sense them you know

417
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:58,820
spikes down that line but here's what

418
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:01,158
I'm saying if I have a computer and it

419
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:03,200
has a VGA port which obviously my laptop

420
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:06,909
doesn't that's why I'm using this lovely

421
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,909
Windows machine over here

422
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:16,539
so does that port expect to receive a

423
00:24:12,349 --> 00:24:21,710
whole bunch of signals back the monitor

424
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:23,960
not so much so you can send signals on a

425
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:26,779
line all day long that's an outlet line

426
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,479
nobody's listening are you going to

427
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:33,009
affect lunch

428
00:24:28,479 --> 00:24:35,059
no and that's part of what's happening

429
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:35,920
with people who say I'm going to use

430
00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:40,139
entertain

431
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:42,190
come to do those okay first off the

432
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,870
entertainment systems are connected

433
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:48,460
through something called a net a network

434
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:50,949
extension device and this net is used as

435
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:55,300
a gateway so a gateway connects

436
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:58,810
different kinds of necklace together now

437
00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:02,260
remember that avionics networks never

438
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:06,070
wireless it's not compatible tcp/ip so

439
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:16,050
you have tcp/ip out in the seats you

440
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:21,700
have not tcp/ip in them so you'll have

441
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:25,720
this net another schematic think that's

442
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:28,530
a bit your niche in the corner the

443
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,530
picture is kind of small

444
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:34,280
anyway one of the reasons that are a few

445
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:39,860
people out there that are will be

446
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:45,250
confused about this is that Boeing asked

447
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:48,530
for special permission in order to

448
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:53,120
connect the passenger information

449
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:56,720
network to other numbers basically they

450
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,580
said hey it'd be nice if people sit in

451
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:02,660
the back can see a little screen that

452
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:04,399
says here's your flight is where you are

453
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:06,470
here's how fast you're going here's your

454
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:10,280
altitude it's where we're going here's

455
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:14,000
what we'll get there so you need some

456
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:16,340
information from up front and they're

457
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:21,560
like okay can we do this and that Faye

458
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:24,470
said yes provided to use a net and some

459
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:30,120
certain other conditions remember do you

460
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:31,890
think those conditions were bad yes

461
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:37,679
otherwise they wouldn't certify the

462
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:41,100
plane so evidence said they have two

463
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:43,980
insurers different stuff and highlighted

464
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:46,020
isolation prom or airplane electronic

465
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,260
system security protection against all

466
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,260
these

467
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:59,360
I'm serious it's like two feet so what's

468
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:03,420
the dead and you talk about that a

469
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:06,060
little bit you have to go through this

470
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:09,540
gateway every connection has to be

471
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:12,840
programmed the FMS flight management

472
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:17,070
system does not expect to receive any

473
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:19,290
input whatsoever of this bad man so even

474
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:20,310
if you compromise the dead and then

475
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:24,000
they're trying to send your bogus

476
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:25,980
signals into the a genomics that it's

477
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,650
going to ignore you it's gonna say I'm

478
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:32,420
sorry what you are on they're

479
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:32,420
unimportant so screw you

480
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:39,979
here's something I stainless Lee stole

481
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:43,220
from a manufacturer's site there you go

482
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:45,180
there's one of the many possible heads

483
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:48,090
all right

484
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:51,540
tears back I guess about five years ago

485
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:55,070
now there's a plane and that disappeared

486
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:55,070
you guys probably heard about this

487
00:27:55,190 --> 00:28:04,100
Malaysian airline

488
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:07,220
the Boeing triple7 uses Eric 6:29 which

489
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:08,959
is even the last night Ethernet in the

490
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:13,010
stuff we're talking about now this is

491
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,840
like the old statement and what happened

492
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:19,660
right after that bunch of people came

493
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:26,659
out like hey it was cyber my tent

494
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:28,880
invented a new word cyber high-tech so a

495
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:31,850
lot of these people who are making with

496
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,910
claims well first of all it's like the

497
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:38,179
thing just disappear and then everyone

498
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:41,150
extract lines so you know I get this

499
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:45,400
quite often yeah a little be an oxidant

500
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:48,110
and the next day people ask me so Phil

501
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:52,010
what do you think happened there like I

502
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:55,870
wasn't there I have zero data it's just

503
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:58,879
wild speculation for me to say anything

504
00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:00,979
but apparently some people don't have a

505
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:06,920
problem with that it was like that I'll

506
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:11,120
speculate all the old and some people

507
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:15,680
have like zero background engagements

508
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:20,010
like never pilot never once bringing in

509
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:23,679
this company you know just

510
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:25,120
maybe a freeware PC sim one day and it's

511
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,400
strapped you late at all we know the

512
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,080
triple seven I don't mention any names

513
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:34,480
but there are people out there that are

514
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:36,370
done okay

515
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,030
there's some stuff I wanted to include

516
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:45,549
but I can't tell you everything because

517
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:50,590
well a lot of NDA's my life okay so now

518
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:53,530
because we're getting Microsoft here and

519
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:56,260
I have to switch and then try to show

520
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:58,299
you a couple little fun videos by the

521
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:08,799
way these are intended to be somewhat

522
00:29:58,299 --> 00:30:10,720
humorous so here is the 101 out of and

523
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,730
welcome to how to acting to maintain

524
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,370
control of a commercial airplane

525
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:17,530
step one when trying to get access to

526
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:19,090
the planes navigation system try to

527
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:22,020
utilize the plants in light

528
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:22,020
entertainment system

529
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,520
[Music]

530
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:37,639
this is near to impossible both with

531
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:41,840
enough typing and hack robust words such

532
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:44,270
as hi man and three relative network

533
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:49,070
innovate also attended another burger

534
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:51,170
yeah you can make it seem like the

535
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:53,179
employer England and navigation systems

536
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:59,510
are connected and the sprite an Air

537
00:30:53,180 --> 00:31:01,580
Marshal enough to incapacitate with the

538
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:07,460
Apache one could be able to sign up to

539
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:10,760
the plants Wi-Fi her breathe okay by the

540
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:13,700
way credit for these videos these videos

541
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:17,600
were made of the road at the University

542
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:23,620
of location or at least harass the

543
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:26,270
flight crew and I did ask one of my

544
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:28,820
former colleagues up there if she was

545
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:32,879
able to come down today had a

546
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:35,759
co-presenter fortunate

547
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:40,210
so she's responsible for all these

548
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:44,009
videos okay what about GA plans general

549
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:47,799
aviation planes pretty much thought

550
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:51,130
about these do there are some GA planes

551
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:53,980
out there that how in-flight Wi-Fi it's

552
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:55,269
not super common primarily it's

553
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:57,279
something you're gonna find into this

554
00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:59,649
jet if you're flying around a little

555
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:01,179
Cessna and you want internet access

556
00:31:59,649 --> 00:32:04,570
you're probably going to use stuff from

557
00:32:01,179 --> 00:32:09,639
your phone or hotspot that's based off

558
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:11,950
of those systems now these systems and

559
00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:15,399
the few points that have taken with this

560
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:19,539
jet may actually be connected to the

561
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:23,370
avionics networks and there are some

562
00:32:19,539 --> 00:32:26,620
potential vulnerabilities there however

563
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:29,949
it's not terribly smart to happen

564
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:36,100
playing that you would have to be at the

565
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:38,950
top so yeah for these small guys there's

566
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:42,000
potential vulnerability there but let's

567
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:45,389
be honest there are easier ways to

568
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,370
attack your on the plane

569
00:32:45,389 --> 00:32:50,830
why do you have to you know hack the

570
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:54,129
Wi-Fi and connect to avionics it's like

571
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:56,379
you're physically there if you're on the

572
00:32:54,129 --> 00:32:58,559
plane obviously you don't value your

573
00:32:56,379 --> 00:32:58,559
life

574
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:05,000
I think we need to establish that there

575
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:06,890
are several generations of IFV employed

576
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,480
entertainment systems out there you've

577
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:11,810
got some old stuff that have a lot of

578
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:15,380
direct connectivity but a lot of the new

579
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:17,899
stuff is just like a FDX networks is 29

580
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:19,910
it's all completely segment and down

581
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:24,140
hard-wired unidirectional pipes because

582
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:27,110
it has a that they right exactly yeah

583
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:30,410
so and again a lot of what I'm going to

584
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:31,729
talk about here today you can you can

585
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:36,080
totally mess with the general aviation

586
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:38,530
guys hold it but when it comes to the

587
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,530
big boys

588
00:33:43,389 --> 00:33:50,539
ATSB idiots the attacks are something

589
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:53,330
people like to talk about a lot it is B

590
00:33:50,539 --> 00:33:57,200
stands for automatic dependent

591
00:33:53,330 --> 00:34:01,100
surveillance broadcast it was a system

592
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:04,100
first pioneered in Alaska for something

593
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:06,799
called free flights Alaska as Marc

594
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:08,509
airplanes and cars they have poor radar

595
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:13,819
coverage because Alaska if you didn't

596
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:19,010
know this is huge there next to Canada

597
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:21,020
Alaska is very large so the idea is

598
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:23,000
planes talk to each other there's a

599
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:24,319
conflict they work out that's the whole

600
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,980
idea of free flight

601
00:34:24,319 --> 00:34:32,869
so that's a BS B there's maybe as a

602
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:35,359
which is the addressable version which

603
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:38,869
is what the airliners use and what's the

604
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:41,810
difference here's a good analogy cable

605
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:45,609
TV I have a cable ready television I can

606
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:48,889
hook it up and came I need a cable box

607
00:34:45,609 --> 00:34:51,049
to buy movies and stuff because I need

608
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:55,879
it to be addressable I need to be able

609
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:56,899
to say hey new new specific box here's

610
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:59,230
your room

611
00:34:56,899 --> 00:34:59,230
right

612
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:05,090
so with the little guys they have

613
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:07,760
something called tis be tis be a

614
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:09,550
subtropical firm ation that will be

615
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:13,310
displayed in the cockpit

616
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:16,370
it uses a DSP which is sent to air

617
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:22,160
traffic control and then air traffic

618
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:27,049
control forwards die to receivers in

619
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:28,730
your top right the big boys have

620
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:30,860
something called T CAD which is a

621
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:36,950
collision avoidance system does not use

622
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:40,480
a DSP effort right why shouldn't say

623
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:47,368
that okay a modern tcats

624
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:53,589
system I'm sorry T CAD as was it

625
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:59,200
Casta system there is an allowance for

626
00:35:53,589 --> 00:36:03,430
far away displays of aircraft based on a

627
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:07,359
DSP however you will never ever get an

628
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:11,290
alert telling you decline to send turn

629
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:13,960
whatever based on it will always be

630
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:15,940
based on transponder signals so

631
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:18,069
transponder is just something that since

632
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:20,260
are waiting for it get it by radar

633
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:24,430
it goes over here and have sense of

634
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:28,240
information that is the only thing that

635
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:29,919
they use in a Tcat system they use

636
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,890
directional antennas they figure out

637
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,500
here's where you are they don't believe

638
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:36,819
your if you send an ad SB

639
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:39,430
signal saying am i right off your right

640
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:42,190
way they like oh you're not I just

641
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:46,259
picked your transponder nobody answer to

642
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:46,260
your life or your DPS and

643
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:54,240
so transponders just talked about the

644
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:59,540
holes are real quick

645
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,540
ATS become so what is that

646
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:07,109
ain't you up to another location or at

647
00:37:04,769 --> 00:37:08,999
least harass the flight crew simply have

648
00:37:07,109 --> 00:37:11,220
your pilot Frank's by multiple planes

649
00:37:08,999 --> 00:37:13,558
from behind and around the plane even

650
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:15,419
life have said planks sent to the

651
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:16,829
transponder signals to the hijacked

652
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:19,289
plane and force it to react to

653
00:37:16,829 --> 00:37:23,089
resolution advisories the crew may

654
00:37:19,289 --> 00:37:23,089
possibly reach out to another location

655
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:49,460
if you make a lotta work wanted to

656
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,460
borrow that

657
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:58,880
in actuality here's what what happened

658
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:24,779
so basically what would happen maybe SP

659
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:30,990
attack against an airliner essentially

660
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:33,660
nothing now once again you talk about

661
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:36,810
generally the ancient there are some

662
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:39,330
cheap abs be receivers out there in fact

663
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:42,210
some of these suckers are less than 200

664
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:45,779
bucks there's something called a scrap

665
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:48,990
tux it's trying to be like a strat us

666
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:50,970
which is an expensive unit strap tux

667
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:54,120
it's made with raspberry pi a couple of

668
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:56,100
awards ad SB receiver it even has

669
00:38:54,120 --> 00:39:00,960
something called a arse but shows you

670
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:02,850
you know which ways off guess what don't

671
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,560
suckers oh you send those signals in

672
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:07,560
there it would be like let me just play

673
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:11,970
that for you pilot so you can totally

674
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:14,299
mess with the GA file especially if he's

675
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:14,299
got an achievement

676
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:20,569
sometimes some people have talked about

677
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,160
tacking engine system

678
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:26,010
basically I'll just say little quickly

679
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:29,098
at the time it's it's like the VTA more

680
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:32,790
thing again you're trying to use a

681
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:35,490
monitor to attack it's just a monitor

682
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:39,690
remember those LifeLock commercials I

683
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:42,569
think they're you're being robbed I'm

684
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:43,680
just a monitor like in the bank you guys

685
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:47,330
know what I'm talking about girl looked

686
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,330
at me like what the hell yeah

687
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:54,180
similar situation then there's eight

688
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:57,570
parks eight cars is used for air-ground

689
00:39:54,180 --> 00:40:03,629
communications for things like weather

690
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:06,390
delays manifest even maintenance some of

691
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:09,300
you might have heard hey after this

692
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:11,879
plane disappeared there was some signals

693
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:17,760
received they might hear about that the

694
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:22,920
Malaysian airliner yes

695
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:25,080
so the engines can spend ACARS messages

696
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:28,140
to the manufacturer and to the airline

697
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:29,580
for maintenance purposes right so

698
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:32,490
there's a lot of research that goes into

699
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:34,560
all of these components in these modern

700
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:39,779
airliners so there's so many messages

701
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:42,119
all the time that's why it's like okay

702
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:44,970
so the fact that you receive some of

703
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:48,150
these messages after you know something

704
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:50,750
disappeared off radar or whatever is not

705
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:50,750
all that unusual

706
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:59,960
how could you attack a cars you could

707
00:40:54,770 --> 00:41:01,730
send a fake message and I'll just and by

708
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:05,900
the way a cars isn't something that we

709
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:07,250
have in GA anyway so it's not like but

710
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:10,190
there's Riley don't want me to even

711
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:11,570
retain control is a harsh message we're

712
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:15,760
a crew receives flight plan

713
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:15,760
modifications agency preferences

714
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,810
[Music]

715
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:40,070
make sure some theaters - I don't know

716
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:40,070
doesn't terrify the Jews

717
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:52,420
[Music]

718
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:09,589
in conclusion hijacking an airplane very

719
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:11,480
serious kindly leave and requires a

720
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:14,030
specific set of circumstances that are

721
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:17,060
very alright so that's that's all I have

722
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:21,859
the time for us fortunately you know if

723
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:27,529
you have any questions or comments feel

724
00:42:21,859 --> 00:42:29,720
free to find a later slide that I will

725
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:32,660
not share this slide deck in part

726
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:37,009
because it has like embedded videos

727
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:41,020
which didn't play on this so

728
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:44,020
unfortunately it's nice thanks yeah

729
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:44,020
thanks
