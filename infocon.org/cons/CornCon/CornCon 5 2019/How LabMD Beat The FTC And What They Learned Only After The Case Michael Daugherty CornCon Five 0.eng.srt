1
00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:06,560
cousin Tony this isn't the kids trapped

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,039
[Music]

3
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:26,119
I think Carlos the circle people our

4
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:28,369
services picture with us saying they're

5
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:32,570
some kind of antenna microphone

6
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:34,400
all right it's 149 here to be exact it's

7
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,129
we're four minutes late we don't have to

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:41,030
move like Dority the next speaker

9
00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:44,500
quickly through this fog help me out

10
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:48,080
with that it's left an epic sometimes

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:51,160
some of us you know like in some was

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:54,699
hated by the always entertaining so I

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:01:13,910
can say other than any wrestling here

14
00:00:54,699 --> 00:01:16,970
they've got smooth path stuff here today

15
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:19,729
most of it is fine and updating and so

16
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:22,759
forgive me for the typo right off the

17
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:24,860
bat it's the lab MD but immediately of

18
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:27,080
course they point out so thank you for

19
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,509
that I got a question because I kind of

20
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,090
a I'm going to close this talk how many

21
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:34,790
appear have heard this story before

22
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:38,630
through me speaking here so this is an

23
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:40,159
update okay so about half that's sugar

24
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,619
yeah because there's a lot that happens

25
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,600
since but I have that so I'm going to

26
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:46,610
care through the beginning forgiving

27
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:51,199
bunch of muscle slides I guess we'll try

28
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:53,659
to get this as quick as possible so yes

29
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,590
WebMD cybercrime politics gaming house

30
00:01:53,659 --> 00:02:00,200
like a funeral because as you all know

31
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:03,320
11 decent medical laboratories pathology

32
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:07,579
testing some another 7,000 patients a

33
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:10,369
free-standing medical facility and that

34
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:12,680
really in my world all I cared about was

35
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:15,560
Health and Human Services not a public

36
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:21,560
company tested for cancer I just thought

37
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:23,810
my life was spec said stupid man so we

38
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,970
run into the the government coming in

39
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,560
now y'all technical services but this

40
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,660
picture is something that has become

41
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,840
more and more meaningful over time

42
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,970
because the bag has been over my head

43
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,510
for about a decade I've learned it's

44
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:43,250
been nothing more than blowback from all

45
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:46,390
these issues when we had a loss of data

46
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:50,150
every six I can't I don't easily reach

47
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:51,410
but so so we could you know what I

48
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:53,120
didn't realize I was going to the time

49
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:55,849
and always the room hears that you're a

50
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,530
side track with all this noise from

51
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:59,238
everyone kind of just blame you and

52
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,680
having to deal that and the government

53
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:05,920
won't deal with that and what we want to

54
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:09,859
know is what's really going on and so

55
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:12,410
the original theoretical battle was what

56
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:14,209
the government said we didn't do well

57
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:15,980
haven't needed that employ basic risk

58
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:17,930
management techniques or safeguards such

59
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,750
as automated intrusion detection systems

60
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,889
file integrity monitoring software

61
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,450
penetration testing also failed monitor

62
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:26,959
traffic coming across those firewalls

63
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:32,119
that's terrible what a lousy company you

64
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:36,019
all should be shot so and so versus what

65
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:39,319
the Eleventh Circuit said ten years

66
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:41,090
later lab B's program included a

67
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,869
compliance program training firewalls in

68
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,370
with monitoring

69
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,540
record is not clear on the point we

70
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,220
assume the building manager installed

71
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,709
paragraph location hours of workstation

72
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:51,680
the big picture is look at that look at

73
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:52,530
the first accusation and what you have

74
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,930
to

75
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,760
that's not true in the meantime the

76
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,760
white noise from everybody I came from

77
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,519
medicine and only medicine for 30 years

78
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:06,269
so it was a very wild experience to walk

79
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,550
into the world of you're guilty because

80
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:10,350
we say so

81
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:12,569
and look at all the people you put risk

82
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,579
yawning gap Abbas's you know you just

83
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:16,529
can't go over and so what I used to talk

84
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,850
about a lot of courses the FTC playbook

85
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:20,668
and I would just speak about what was

86
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:23,340
going on at the time and that we're in

87
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:26,130
his time past this is 2008 things start

88
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:29,039
you get more into 2000 really post

89
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:31,380
WikiLeaks and you go oh maybe maybe

90
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,900
everyone's vulnerable so you went from

91
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,969
like this freak out in two thousand

92
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:39,299
eight or nine away nine thousand

93
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:42,720
patients oh my god to Blue Cross 93

94
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:45,150
million whatever and sort of written

95
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,650
that entire way but now I'm people

96
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,049
didn't understand their self-interest in

97
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,090
their organizations that one break and

98
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,130
one chain can break your organization

99
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:56,489
gap that used to sound just you know

100
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:58,710
crazy now it kind of expands it so they

101
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,940
were we're repairing the plane we're

102
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,340
building the plane were fixing the claim

103
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:05,070
walks up flying and everything there any

104
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:07,260
corporations and I consciously chose to

105
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,760
be an entrepreneur in a company that was

106
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,820
kind of small because I couldn't stand

107
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,169
that stuff but what I've seen all these

108
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,550
companies then I was like no one wants

109
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:15,960
to hear this story because everyone's

110
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,539
just concerned about where is the blame

111
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,390
going now how do we keep the company

112
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:25,750
safe it's like I just

113
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:27,610
that's good so no I couldn't I realize

114
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:31,090
how am I gonna make people care about

115
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:32,950
this other than it's just a sort of soap

116
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:36,010
opera this story because that's not what

117
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:37,630
I wanted to do and then really there's

118
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,610
nothing I can do about that until the

119
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:41,290
courts overturn the Federal Trade

120
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,630
Commission and the other the FTC will

121
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:45,580
return their judge so easy go through

122
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,380
the FTC is most some you know image they

123
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,300
have their own agendas and their judges

124
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,270
don't go by the rules of civil procedure

125
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,830
they don't go by the rules of evidence

126
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,240
they have their own rules so your

127
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:57,010
lawyers that come in they're used to the

128
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:01,690
real world to do show error like in

129
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:04,270
Alice in Wonderland and so the judges

130
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,530
are below the commissioners then you go

131
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,299
through this hearing and all this

132
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:09,219
procedure for three years and after that

133
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,880
that's all done the commissioners just

134
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:15,180
over Hummer sent a time last wires so

135
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,040
what they said everyone's opinion is

136
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,840
under the FTC act Baltimore expose data

137
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,540
is now serving unfair business practice

138
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,179
so if you have any data this vulnerable

139
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:27,460
exposed and you know that definition

140
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:31,060
they can make up like whatever then you

141
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:32,320
could be great so it's just a lot of not

142
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:38,200
getting caught because if you get in

143
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:39,670
there web and then they determine it can

144
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,979
rule up how many security practices were

145
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:46,180
unreasonable if that harm even without

146
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:50,050
tangible harm so my loaded gun could

147
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:52,350
make me you know guilty of murder

148
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:56,200
because someone could have been hurt or

149
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:58,090
can't prove some got hurt but so this

150
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,340
this kind of freaked everyone out now

151
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:03,549
said they were like oh my gosh at lab M

152
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,510
deep losses were just then a hell of a

153
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:08,470
big fight all the time

154
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:10,900
no kid okay so what happened eleven deep

155
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,920
right so I'll try to go this pretty

156
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,679
quick for those that have heard this

157
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,940
before but two thousand eight to nine we

158
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,800
were quote about hacked we didn't know

159
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:20,140
was a hack at the time we had someone

160
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,000
con say to had our stuff and they found

161
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,150
that with cyberspace so we were never

162
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,800
told it was taken from our workstation

163
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:33,340
FTC investigation 2014-15 the honest

164
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,020
this 2010 - 30 - sorry 2014 and 15 we

165
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:38,679
have the administrative trial or hearing

166
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:40,570
in the FTC and Congress starts to

167
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,060
investigate this is where it starts

168
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:44,980
Bentley crazy right 16 17 the FTC

169
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:49,210
overturns we end up in the US Court of

170
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:52,810
Appeals and then WebMD one if you call

171
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:56,799
it a destroyed gone but now vindicated

172
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:59,050
in 2018 so now we're in the rearview

173
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,840
mirror like what what the heck happened

174
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:03,830
and this was me in the beginning stupid

175
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,539
naive and they came

176
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:08,448
justice is going to win out this will be

177
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:10,009
brief and cheap as we didn't do anything

178
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:11,419
where to stuff goes in cancer and we're

179
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:13,629
all really nice people who made nothing

180
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:16,400
wrong so hopefully it won't attack us so

181
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:24,710
as you can see babies are really dumb

182
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:27,258
and one person is using line we're on a

183
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:31,959
work station and one of our billing

184
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:35,740
things gets out and it's insane how much

185
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:39,469
work and sideshow went into that and

186
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:43,610
after this is when diverse ëcause us up

187
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:47,410
and says hi I'm Robert Baalbek I'm the

188
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:50,260
CEO and founder of tech versa we do

189
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:52,939
remediation and the cyber criminal

190
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:56,959
investigation and we found when your

191
00:08:52,940 --> 00:09:00,680
files out of cyberspace and you know we

192
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,268
do we can fix that if you like and my

193
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,430
first question is what's the IP address

194
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:05,810
and maybe a response is all I have to

195
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:08,270
know that it's gonna resolve and make

196
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:11,300
that a services contract so the point of

197
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:13,939
that is because I heard this before but

198
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,790
it usually takes about seven times for

199
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:20,390
it to marinate in people's brains

200
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:22,490
especially I know it's there's so many

201
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:25,399
branches flying off this tree it's hard

202
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:27,680
to follow sometimes but that two-year

203
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:29,329
period is really just a big extortion

204
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,939
attempt and all we wanted to do is make

205
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:33,589
them go away so I would hire him but I

206
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,250
also didn't turn over the authorities

207
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:37,589
you know we call the police once

208
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:40,709
well we don't have any jurisdiction over

209
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:42,389
that they know what to do now they tell

210
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:43,680
you what to do where they take their

211
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:49,470
jurisdiction back then they're just like

212
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,859
and so so that time they finally went

213
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:53,040
away

214
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:55,019
and after they threatened us to go the

215
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,540
government you know tried to guilt trip

216
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:59,970
us like crazy and send us all this media

217
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:02,069
that they were involved in about other

218
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:04,379
people that had been gone through this

219
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:07,139
including Supreme Court Justice Breyer

220
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:09,959
and all sorts of stuff like that

221
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:12,300
and were furious that we would just not

222
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:14,279
take the big part but I think I was a

223
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,910
crook because in medicine you don't you

224
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:20,220
don't call up medical facilities and say

225
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,420
it got your stuff but but not gonna help

226
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,250
you unless you pay me unless you're not

227
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:26,040
a good guy that just doesn't roll even

228
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:28,230
if you are competing laboratory we don't

229
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,819
undermine each other because the patient

230
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:33,509
is number one and that's why medicine is

231
00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:34,740
so different all right so Jason we think

232
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:36,149
the coast is clear the Federal Trade

233
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,209
Commission calls us up and says they're

234
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:41,069
starting a non-public investigation more

235
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:43,888
more cute little terms I didn't know

236
00:10:41,069 --> 00:10:46,290
what they meant learned later and then a

237
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:49,379
few weeks after that this goes out and

238
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:51,360
in the press and this is how the FTC

239
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:52,709
operates this is how government and how

240
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,889
they said they'd never make comments

241
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:57,300
before a case but they comment before

242
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:59,610
becomes during case but they make

243
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:01,889
comments before the case because the

244
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:03,569
media just because of who they are and

245
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:05,519
they're the US government the media will

246
00:11:03,569 --> 00:11:07,769
be there free PR Herrmann and put this

247
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,449
carefully worded stuff I and there will

248
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:11,850
be no rearview mirrors so we have

249
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:14,579
widespread data breaches uncovered by

250
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:15,930
FTC Pro years later we find out there

251
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:17,579
were no breaches and it really was an

252
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,410
FTC Pro but that's beside the point

253
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:23,279
so your members of the FTC warns of

254
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:25,110
improperly so sensitive data on p2p

255
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,070
file-sharing networks the photo tray

256
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,390
100 organizations that personal

257
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:30,160
information including sensitive data

258
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:31,449
about customers and employees has been

259
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,160
shared from the organisation's for peer

260
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:35,410
networks is available in period for file

261
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,329
sharing networks this is wordsmithing

262
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:38,230
to the nth degree but you can't know

263
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,790
that it be done anything about

264
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:42,940
technology and how many people really

265
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:44,110
know some about technology that works so

266
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,460
everybody thinks about there they're

267
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:48,730
there the government goes healthy that's

268
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:50,440
all thank you but I'm trying to figure

269
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:52,060
out who the FTC is they've never been in

270
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,530
a medical meeting and are licensing me

271
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,030
for anything in my life I've been in

272
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:57,100
medicine for 30 years the surgery and

273
00:11:55,030 --> 00:12:00,579
cancer diagnostics and so I find that

274
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:02,050
section 5 is they get their job as to

275
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,870
protect consumers from unfairness or

276
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:07,599
deception and this was built up in 1914

277
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:10,810
so if they defeat Minh they stay a

278
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,730
practice isn't fair what is a causes or

279
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:15,099
is likely to cause substantial injury to

280
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,900
consumers cannot be reasonably avoided

281
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,030
by consumers and is not outweighed by

282
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:21,280
countervailing benefits to consumers or

283
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:23,740
competition now that looks like English

284
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:26,530
that's lawyer it's a different language

285
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:29,080
that sounds the same and so yeah be

286
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:30,130
careful because causes or is likely to

287
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,800
cause substantial

288
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:34,780
cannot be reasonably avoided is that how

289
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,609
way by countervailing benefits and you

290
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:40,600
then have to decide and the definition

291
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:42,490
changes like so if you're if you want a

292
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,680
few people on the receiving and it being

293
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,980
regulated by

294
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:49,020
this isn't funny and this has been made

295
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,630
a hundred years ago so when technology

296
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:53,490
started it was a battle in DC like Oh

297
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:56,880
who's gonna get to regulate data that's

298
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:58,410
so juicy and the FTC decided this was

299
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,380
going to be the broadest one when this

300
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:02,670
Congress was making their loss so we

301
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,020
kept a little bit this so why is that

302
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,459
Congress making one of that if this is

303
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:08,579
my quick little history 101

304
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:09,899
my pure opinion about this I don't think

305
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,910
I'm wrong is that this whole thing

306
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:14,220
started a hundred years ago a way

307
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:16,649
Woodrow Wilson decided well-intentioned

308
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:20,339
that you're going to have politicians

309
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:21,570
regulate industry and science and that's

310
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:23,970
a recipe for disaster

311
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:27,209
so you want to build this administrative

312
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:30,000
state part is these agencies that were

313
00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:32,390
supposed to be just experts in those

314
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,370
fields that didn't last long

315
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:36,689
well instant because we have these four

316
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,550
branches of the three grants of

317
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:41,700
government or they're split in two and

318
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:43,770
they're all separated in power okay and

319
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:46,020
sometimes it doesn't work really well

320
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:47,790
when you have the reality of science so

321
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:49,850
we create this government agency an

322
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:53,939
administrative process which is now

323
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:55,950
lasted and they don't have separation of

324
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,720
powers they have this the judges and the

325
00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:00,000
lawyers and the rule makers are all in

326
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,190
the same roof and we're just supposed to

327
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,750
trust them so the hand becomes the fist

328
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:05,700
because there's really no separation of

329
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:09,000
powers and when you get snared in them

330
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:12,630
like when the FTC contacted us and

331
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,450
started the investigation by law judges

332
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:17,130
and Congress and no other branch of the

333
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:20,070
government could stop what they were

334
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:21,630
doing until they were done that means

335
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:24,990
we're all banking that they're really

336
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:26,579
nice honest people and then and how they

337
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:28,380
then they don't get real nice and honest

338
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:32,040
if you don't

339
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:34,920
and so we go up to DC and we're just

340
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,870
hoping people go away and my lawyers are

341
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,029
baffled and WikiLeaks is starting and

342
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:41,070
why are they bugging a sporty employee

343
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:42,899
can detention center when their science

344
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:44,910
records are those stuff and I'm

345
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:46,350
horrified to any kind of these

346
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,339
bureaucrats police I know what the hell

347
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,860
they're talking about

348
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:51,089
and everything's very memorized and I

349
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,920
realized the problem medicine and

350
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:54,089
technology that the common burden is

351
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,649
that we're being run by these people

352
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:58,529
that they're truly no experience like

353
00:14:55,649 --> 00:15:00,480
the FTC has like you know one expert

354
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:01,589
that becomes from another University for

355
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,170
here and they think that's enough

356
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:06,350
background it's it's it's terrifying if

357
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:08,040
you're in it but because it's

358
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,440
divide-and-conquer and you're the only

359
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,810
one in there alone I guarantee you

360
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,000
nobody in the media or the tech world

361
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:21,239
believes a CEO that's bitching and

362
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:23,100
moaning as the one you just know so so

363
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,899
the best thing are fun I'm gonna read

364
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,399
this you don't have to read it just

365
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:28,380
listen to it because this is the best

366
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,410
thing that's summarized the absurdity of

367
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:33,720
what the F the power the FTC has and

368
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:35,219
we're never taught this by the way so

369
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,170
the FTC the Federal Trade Commission

370
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,180
promulgate substantive rules of conduct

371
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:41,699
the Commission then considers whether to

372
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:44,459
authorize investigations into what the

373
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:46,560
Commission's rules have been broken the

374
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:48,569
Commission authorizes an investigation

375
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,489
the investigation is conducted by the

376
00:15:48,569 --> 00:15:52,560
Commission which reports its findings to

377
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:54,000
the Commission if the Commission thinks

378
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,829
that the Commission's findings weren't

379
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,940
an enforcement action the Commission

380
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,739
issues a complaint

381
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:01,199
the Commission's complaint that a

382
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,970
commission rule has been violated is

383
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,219
then prosecuted by the Commission and

384
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,930
adjudicated by the Commission this

385
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,699
Commission adjudication you need to take

386
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:10,439
place before the full commission before

387
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:12,389
a semi-autonomous Commission

388
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,220
administrative law judge if the

389
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:15,810
Commission chooses to adjudicate before

390
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,990
administrative law judge rather than

391
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:20,359
before the Commission and the decision

392
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:22,220
a commission the commission can appeal

393
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,200
to the Commission if the Commission

394
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:26,000
ultimately finds a violation then only

395
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,580
then effective private party can filter

396
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,680
article 3 court but the ACCC decision

397
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:32,360
before the bona fide article 3 tribunal

398
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,469
is this is a very strong presumption of

399
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,800
correctness of both matters affecting

400
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:38,420
law because the government is legally

401
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,120
supposed to get the benefit of the devil

402
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:54,770
that basically summarizes the unknown

403
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:57,170
Road I was walking from 2010 to 2012 is

404
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:58,730
all they're really saving the world but

405
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:01,520
really their friend may hell out of you

406
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:03,530
if you dare to push back and so there's

407
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,780
a kind of my head up ok Daugherty you

408
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:08,300
better settle and then you better assign

409
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:10,099
a consent decree that says and really

410
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,569
fine print you admit to nothing wrong

411
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:13,490
and of course you know everyone

412
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:15,319
understands that when you're holding

413
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:17,270
seven or thousand cancer patients

414
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:18,649
diagnosis and you agree to have the

415
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,150
government come in and investigate you

416
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:21,680
for 20 years at your expense

417
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,540
just to audit here for the next two

418
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:27,080
decades then you did it because you did

419
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:28,430
nothing wrong so it's kind of like which

420
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,379
way do you want to go you want

421
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:32,450
reputation to go down or do you want us

422
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:34,370
to just you know investigate you

423
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:36,050
and my words are screaming at me like

424
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:38,419
you have don't upset them and I'm like

425
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:40,370
there is nothing that it doesn't have

426
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:44,210
set them if you don't go along

427
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:47,120
completely actually they're not called

428
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:49,340
they're abused because with law have big

429
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,189
companies go along to get along

430
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:54,350
and so there they were just really

431
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:58,060
thought early on they thought it was you

432
00:17:54,350 --> 00:18:00,439
know cute until I started

433
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:02,570
and then my lawyers that I eventually

434
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,880
hired ahead government experience

435
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:07,700
because my lawyers in Atlanta didn't

436
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,400
understand this operation and couldn't

437
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:11,840
understand it so they that would be

438
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,140
getting threats from people on my team

439
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,189
like you better sign they're gonna bury

440
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,860
procedures and Dave so it's basically

441
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:20,600
though but but the short version of what

442
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:23,320
they can choose to do to you is they can

443
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:26,959
go to the articles report right away

444
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:30,800
where they can get handed their heads

445
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,690
like just happen to the airport they of

446
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,129
the no fly rule to see that one this

447
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:36,170
week on the net flight will shoot is

448
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:38,090
unconstitutional is right now and then

449
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,770
came out of an article 3 court the

450
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:41,689
Western District on Sylvania but if they

451
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:42,830
go there Administrative Court none of

452
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,000
those other courts or any other

453
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,020
government can intervene till they're

454
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,350
done with you and then that's basically

455
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:50,210
a marathon torture of hell you know

456
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:52,159
diminished dread the drain you dry over

457
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:53,810
time they don't the rules they allow

458
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,300
hearsay attorneys are privileged to have

459
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:57,560
attorneys that are investigating him and

460
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,419
their investigations are privileged

461
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,850
because their attorneys so there's no

462
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:04,270
due process there's no discovery you

463
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:06,800
can't be told what they have against you

464
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:08,389
so it's hard fighting so they want to

465
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,889
have some the time your reputation is

466
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,210
assassinated because what Americans are

467
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:14,270
taught that's right so of course I'm

468
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:16,970
building doubt kills that's at the needs

469
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:18,639
depth psychological warfare that

470
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:20,840
cooperative press image operations

471
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,820
Chevron deference which means Supreme

472
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:25,129
Court doctrine that says the

473
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:27,439
government's benefit oh so that's what

474
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:30,620
you're up against but I had no choice

475
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:35,120
because I wasn't running Nordstrom or TJ

476
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:37,429
Maxx or you know Target that was the

477
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,919
unique spot that with either either

478
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:41,840
choice was a death mountain and nothing

479
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,350
was worse to me than thinking I'm gonna

480
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,270
walk around off for this my life

481
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:48,659
I didn't do it everything saying you

482
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:51,450
didn't do it again poor my crazy so I'm

483
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:53,310
not sorry but it's all head on Spike

484
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,090
it's all we were supposed to be the head

485
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:56,399
on the spike

486
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:58,770
tend to minute everybody into what not

487
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,540
to do and what not to do isn't is that

488
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:02,850
relevant if it really happen or not

489
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:04,980
what's relevant is to build a list of

490
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:06,270
what they don't want you to do so that

491
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,980
you'll know what that is when your

492
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:10,110
lawyer tells you based on what they said

493
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:13,410
Levendi did wrong weather levity bit

494
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:14,850
longer now is not important this is what

495
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:17,430
happens when Congress want to

496
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:19,969
participate the agencies do this type of

497
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:21,960
thing there are absolutely no standards

498
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:23,880
Congress won't do anything they don't

499
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:27,150
want to because it's such a hot potato

500
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:29,700
they can't figure out technology to know

501
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:31,320
to make that a political win and they

502
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,310
don't listen to you guys in the room

503
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,500
that's for sure

504
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:37,290
and so they don't know what to do so

505
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,970
they do nothing and there's so much of a

506
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:41,580
hot potato and so you have various

507
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:43,800
agencies doing grabs for power so if

508
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:45,300
you're running a bank or in medicine

509
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,850
I have healthy human services for

510
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:50,460
everything for years suddenly here's the

511
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:53,790
FTC if I'm in banking I've got the FDIC

512
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:56,640
I've got that sec I've got suddenly this

513
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:58,110
I mean it it's insanity and it's such a

514
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,850
few people that have this

515
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:02,070
over-regulation that most people to

516
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:04,889
understand how it's dragging everything

517
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:06,179
that and the whole game then is too

518
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,530
exhausting as submission so you're

519
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:10,080
amount of research before you get to a

520
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:12,300
fair and impartial Court so luckily I'm

521
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,699
really good at fundraising so I

522
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,350
basically got about thirteen million

523
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:19,820
dollars

524
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:20,809
a defense of us because I was so yes if

525
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,299
you couldn't tell

526
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:25,100
and so this is just a simple game and I

527
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:27,168
start investigating for myself has also

528
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,639
learned investigators lawyers are not

529
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:29,840
investigators right and I couldn't

530
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,960
afford headbutt so I started missing I

531
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,760
found out with this diversity thing that

532
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,830
went on with us Homeland Security was

533
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:39,049
given twenty four million dollars for

534
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:41,870
Studies on peer-to-peer file-sharing

535
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:44,690
leaks in the academic and health care

536
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:46,610
setting and we found that was that that

537
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:49,309
went to Dartmouth and darkened the paper

538
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:52,129
that came out mentioned WebMD in it had

539
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:54,379
our document in it that they took did

540
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:56,690
redacted and read when the patient

541
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:58,250
information was and that they're getting

542
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,650
money off of this and they're giving

543
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:02,900
Homeland Security is giving time about

544
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:05,419
Dartmouth I'm sorry Dartmouth is giving

545
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:08,450
tiburcia all the credit because they got

546
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:11,630
their data versus time Ursa software and

547
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:15,080
then they're chopped up their board is

548
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:17,299
chopped up with tech insiders Howard

549
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,580
Schmidt Poneman visitors their advice

550
00:22:17,299 --> 00:22:23,510
board and Wesley Clark wasn't Clark's

551
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:26,149
out there with them in Congress at

552
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:28,610
hearings with Bhavik telling House

553
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:30,440
Oversight Commerce how dangerous this

554
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:32,719
all is and how we're leaking everything

555
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,520
the Pentagon backbone all sorts of our

556
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,640
army stuff medical information

557
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,470
it's just bogus I didn't know at the

558
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,210
time I couldn't prove it I was just

559
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:43,730
trying to go this

560
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:45,140
how do we air into this and then tie

561
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:47,500
versa put a press release out saying

562
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:50,270
that in 391 28 billion searches a day

563
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,890
4.5 member stations worldwide 13 20

564
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:54,200
million files download they put then

565
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:56,480
they click 11 beef up in front of house

566
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,610
oversight then I discovered this 2 years

567
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,970
after it happens it's kind of creepy you

568
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:04,879
know it's nothing but a shakedown and

569
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:09,980
then if you ever read that people watch

570
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:13,340
the video really the 2007 hearings it's

571
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:14,990
incredible because everyone's just so

572
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:16,520
much more gullible you know we never

573
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:18,080
heard the word breach we know what

574
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,000
things were and the Congress men like

575
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,230
this is an operator they don't realize

576
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,150
that the thief is it right there in

577
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:31,520
front you know no one says it there was

578
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:33,140
just like it's all about getting the

579
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,850
company to break the sign that form a

580
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,590
consent decree and I was the only one of

581
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:38,270
all the companies don't have to after

582
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:40,159
that fought it because that was only one

583
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:43,550
that really had a death or death choice

584
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:45,650
everyone else lessor so the bottom line

585
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:47,389
DC game is get the consent decree bill

586
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:49,010
the president avoid the courts mislead

587
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:51,410
stone on Congress play hero the press

588
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:54,620
and he has better believe me why would

589
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:56,690
you years ago by finances so I'm like

590
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:58,189
trying to get information no one will

591
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:01,970
tell me what we've done wrong or if you

592
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:03,740
do right sands - right this is an expert

593
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:05,450
he's the only guy to ever see anywhere

594
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:08,990
that criticized this whole method of

595
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:11,980
enforcement by the FTC by this time we

596
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,980
knew that

597
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:20,960
bobak had taken the file through this

598
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:22,639
study and therefore he is Bennett who's

599
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,419
a lawyer is saying well this isn't a

600
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,429
breach this is now

601
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:28,590
to the point this is the government

602
00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:31,350
agent coming in and taking something in

603
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:32,850
this files matter control we know where

604
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:34,168
it is we know that we know where it's

605
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:36,359
always been it's never been out of

606
00:24:34,169 --> 00:24:38,129
control this kind of you know blew the

607
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:40,129
minds now he's starting to endless

608
00:24:38,129 --> 00:24:42,658
wordsmithing things with little lawyers

609
00:24:40,129 --> 00:24:44,668
and my lawyer these were there to seize

610
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:47,399
like cannon furious massive terror she's

611
00:24:44,669 --> 00:24:50,940
more sarcastic threatening to me because

612
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:52,859
I haven't done because I'm not signing

613
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,450
and I'm refusing to sign it centigrade

614
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:55,918
she's telling you that well they're

615
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:57,659
gonna watch you for years to come

616
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,639
they'll always investigate you know that

617
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:02,549
you will have them on your back forever

618
00:24:59,639 --> 00:25:05,668
mother that's heartwarming how much was

619
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:09,119
that bro thanks for being on my side and

620
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:11,879
so like why they pick and I'm able or we

621
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:14,879
learn is that it's easy to slaughter

622
00:25:11,879 --> 00:25:17,609
this you know I $250,000 of insurance

623
00:25:14,879 --> 00:25:18,748
three million doesn't malpractice who

624
00:25:17,609 --> 00:25:25,949
thought this was ever going to happen

625
00:25:18,749 --> 00:25:27,629
right so okay and it really is there's

626
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:30,389
this whole thing we don't understand

627
00:25:27,629 --> 00:25:33,178
that you have to go through that makes

628
00:25:30,389 --> 00:25:34,559
everyone buckle pretty much before you

629
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:36,779
can get to someone that's got the power

630
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:39,450
to rein in who's accusing you and that

631
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:40,739
is the gun to the head lawyers that are

632
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:44,009
best gears with immunity that's

633
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:45,749
ridiculous consent decrees which is just

634
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:47,070
your quick way up and your own lawyers

635
00:25:45,749 --> 00:25:49,679
going to talk into doing this because

636
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:52,049
it's the cheaper thing to do mr. law

637
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,419
just is hands are ultimately tied you

638
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:55,950
know you've got the commissioners and

639
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:58,109
then you've got no congressional

640
00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:00,629
intervention until this is all done okay

641
00:25:58,109 --> 00:26:02,789
then you have the judge flawed right the

642
00:26:00,629 --> 00:26:04,889
court of appeals which we won in the

643
00:26:02,789 --> 00:26:07,889
Eleventh Circuit we could easily lost it

644
00:26:04,889 --> 00:26:11,029
we had a judge that lalit judge judge

645
00:26:07,889 --> 00:26:14,409
show glad actually is known to not even

646
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:17,260
rely on his law clerk this guy reads

647
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:19,420
everything and so he came in and just

648
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:21,250
was he's up you'd be shocked how much

649
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:25,480
they don't read you just assumed they're

650
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:27,580
gonna regional case university of law

651
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,710
clerks and their brain function and the

652
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:31,480
quick Evelyn would speed reading skills

653
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:33,640
of a judge so by the time you get up

654
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,200
there you know it's kind of like this ya

655
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,790
know it's like that game when they

656
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,890
started kindergarten purple and you know

657
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:43,120
toaster it's got what can happen in

658
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:45,220
court so I knew I had the long slog but

659
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,479
I took it when I recorded this they went

660
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,040
a hundred Senate I'm one of the

661
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,080
commissioners did a study when he was

662
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:52,960
commissioned of FTC whose everyone to

663
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,429
shed light on this racket and he went

664
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,680
and did data research and said in the

665
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:59,650
past 20 years FTC has ruled in favor I

666
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:01,420
was on the time so you get to go through

667
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,980
this arduous years long expensive thing

668
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,960
to know system farce if you win you're

669
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:06,400
gonna get overturned and so you have to

670
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,770
choose to know that you have to just

671
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,420
walk through the whole fire that there

672
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:12,820
isn't any there's only one there's only

673
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:14,050
two choices don't start it or walk

674
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:17,080
through it completely there's no

675
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:19,030
stopping in of it so we start going to

676
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,790
court and you can see the are the three

677
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:23,050
course we start fighting things to fight

678
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:24,909
positive action starts paying for my

679
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:26,680
defense and their whole thing is to

680
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:28,810
expose government bad behaviors so we

681
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,220
start you think got a lot of money so

682
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:32,260
they start finally motions to file

683
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:35,080
motions to document these sinks in the

684
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:37,030
record and so the judge opens up saying

685
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,290
you know you never agro litigated your

686
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:40,360
authority this area to do this of a

687
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:42,970
paralegal Monica no one goes to court

688
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,949
you can't get to him no one waits that

689
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:46,780
long unless you're crazy like me he

690
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:48,280
beats him up he screams in hell he still

691
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:49,990
says he can't do anything about it and

692
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:52,960
we have to let them continue their

693
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:54,760
investigation because I told them I

694
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,040
wouldn't signing this nth degree they

695
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,180
said we're suing you tomorrow and they

696
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,550
didn't sue us tomorrow

697
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:03,160
they just started a whole nother

698
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:04,930
investigation just try to drive so we

699
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:08,320
started fighting back actually more

700
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:11,950
steam Oh bully because then the press

701
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,649
broke it so guess what the this my staff

702
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:14,980
thanks right okay mine did something

703
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:17,410
wrong

704
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:20,169
what'd he do puppies over because this

705
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:23,410
melty fight okay so I don't know each

706
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:26,260
other so they kill it from within right

707
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:31,030
because you know you'll just doubt kills

708
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:32,890
doubt kills so I decide inside the

709
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:35,799
system ain't gonna work on a red book I

710
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:37,980
wrote a book should title it the fastest

711
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:41,110
way to really piss off the government I

712
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:43,030
love the fact they were mad I can't tell

713
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:45,070
you the whole thing was built on the

714
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:47,770
fact that these people don't care about

715
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:49,418
anything they don't care about justice

716
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:51,179
down here bus divert spirit they care

717
00:28:49,419 --> 00:28:54,120
about you know advancing their own

718
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:56,260
agendas and their careers so that

719
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:58,719
nothing will piss them off in fact

720
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:00,910
that's what they care how great am i

721
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,590
working here I do such wonderful things

722
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:05,130
for the Clementine folk over so I

723
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:08,620
thought and this boy it was a bull's-eye

724
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:10,090
they marched up to our our first status

725
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,739
happens with twenty people from the FTC

726
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:14,320
and the tell my lawyer were really upset

727
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:17,700
about that book and he's like well I

728
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,530
guess we just say 23 on the graph copies

729
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,840
the biggest thing to do is just tell

730
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:24,540
them I'm not afraid if they are not used

731
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:27,449
to it and then what do they do then they

732
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:29,010
come out pummeling pummeling pummeling

733
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:32,490
you know cuz there's this wonderful

734
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:34,340
people okay so they snow me and a week

735
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:36,360
later time versus sues me for defamation

736
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:38,939
what a coincidence

737
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,459
so quick and the books not even out yet

738
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,960
and so the FCC files complaining of

739
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,750
lemon tea for finding Tecna summers

740
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,430
privacy alleges exposure do you see the

741
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:48,930
word preach there now the same people

742
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:53,430
that wrote that three years later

743
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:55,380
don't say breach exposure now this is

744
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:57,270
nothing more than a fight this is to

745
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:00,630
teach me a lesson for daring to

746
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:03,720
challenge their authority and so it's

747
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:05,490
now overturning the entire company forty

748
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:10,380
depositions scaring the bejesus out of

749
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:11,820
everybody we go to that first session

750
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,950
with a pump so they bring all their

751
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,570
lawyers because now the ALJ that the

752
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:17,370
hearings not started that descended guys

753
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:19,020
says what have you done to tell

754
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:20,729
businesses what they're supposed to do

755
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,290
and this is what I put up in quotes

756
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:24,270
because if I said this who would believe

757
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:26,520
me they say there's nothing out there

758
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:28,200
for company to look to now I thought I

759
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,870
was a normal person so I thought I would

760
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,070
say well there's no law and no specific

761
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:34,800
specificity

762
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:37,439
well James said that John I say we're

763
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:41,310
done no we're gonna keep on going

764
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:46,530
this is 2019 oh they didn't tell us too

765
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:48,000
bad for you so everyone says out in pop

766
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:49,800
culture oh it must be HIPAA thing

767
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,060
haven't even a HIPAA thing there's

768
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,610
something wrong you guys did something

769
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:56,190
because everybody knows we did something

770
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:57,090
wrong trust me there's no habits Andy

771
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:59,810
did nothing wrong

772
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:02,540
the best I got this lemony

773
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:05,270
I never I just got you know so this was

774
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:06,680
helpful one of the bloggers just who

775
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:07,250
loved him to see just came at me

776
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,110
big-time

777
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:11,060
never mentor in my life but to her

778
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:12,500
benefit I called her up and had a civil

779
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:15,440
conversation and she wrote a letter to

780
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:17,030
help HHS and she published their

781
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,520
response to the response pepper that's

782
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:21,320
very few people that I found like say

783
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,060
something completely wrong about us and

784
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,230
then correct themselves

785
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:26,480
so she and I are actually pretty good

786
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:28,460
friends now and they said they decided

787
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,840
to join MTC in their investigation we

788
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:34,970
did nothing wrong there was no

789
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:38,959
obligation to notify anybody so there's

790
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:42,350
there's no proof of anything but the

791
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:44,300
company closed and this is where I

792
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:45,980
learned by this point that building

793
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,720
wears many masks no more dangers to the

794
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,220
mask of virtue because this whole thing

795
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:53,420
all these people that are trying to save

796
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:55,550
the world playing dirty dirty dirty with

797
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:58,130
a cancer detection Center and I'm not

798
00:31:55,550 --> 00:32:03,800
getting any moral outrage from the media

799
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:06,080
or Washington oh whoa so that I wrote

800
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,250
that book is it this narrative and tell

801
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,070
my people because they'll tell you to

802
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:11,690
crazy but a road ahead an editor that

803
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:13,220
just busted me around the head so did

804
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:16,970
some like a whack job in there that was

805
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:19,100
her job and it got people's attention I

806
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:22,280
got terrorizes attention a man versus

807
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:26,120
attention let's make attention as a 60

808
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:28,940
Minutes like four times to scary

809
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:31,909
mean it to scare they don't want they of

810
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:33,080
whom I am mister nothing we're not gonna

811
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:35,720
burn our relationship with government

812
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,460
for you sir we'll find another scary

813
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,580
story that doesn't have some people tick

814
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:41,960
off that can hurt us and then another

815
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:44,330
miracle happened by the time the

816
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:47,030
company's closed in January we go

817
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:49,159
through more depositions we get a

818
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:52,160
deposition of Erika Johnson from

819
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:55,310
Dartmouth who says that they didn't get

820
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:57,140
her file through that standard I think

821
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:59,030
they got that final from what he found

822
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,930
when they asked for something they sent

823
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:01,850
out email

824
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:02,419
thank goodness for discovery they said

825
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:04,549
an email

826
00:33:02,419 --> 00:33:05,450
you know this daily sentence isn't what

827
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:07,009
we're looking for

828
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,499
do you know anything that could spice it

829
00:33:07,009 --> 00:33:10,100
up and so they sent them the leg would

830
00:33:09,499 --> 00:33:15,340
be found

831
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:17,600
so the Levendi file came not the way

832
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:20,389
Dartmouth represent they use the

833
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:23,059
government's money for and

834
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:24,678
Rick Wallace calls me he's the guy I

835
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:27,440
find that one night in April like a

836
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:29,450
movie calls make up set to stress the

837
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,580
saying I rent your company it's worse

838
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:33,879
than you know I took your file is never

839
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:37,039
out cyberspace I came in here computer I

840
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:39,889
worked for Babak I'm his number two and

841
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:43,580
we work with the FBI we did child porn

842
00:33:39,889 --> 00:33:46,879
investigations for the FBI and not only

843
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:48,769
is what he wrote true gets worse so I

844
00:33:46,879 --> 00:33:51,219
freaked out he's crying swipes on the

845
00:33:48,769 --> 00:33:54,710
phone it's nuts two days of nuts and

846
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:56,749
tell the lawyers and you know everyone I

847
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:58,669
learned in the rear view mirror that my

848
00:33:56,749 --> 00:34:00,320
lawyers didn't believe me they don't

849
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:03,139
believe you they don't they don't have

850
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:06,350
to believe you to argue so law is debate

851
00:34:03,139 --> 00:34:08,649
it's not the seeking of the truth it's

852
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:12,078
not justice it's not morality it's

853
00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:13,429
argument it's hard to separate that

854
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,770
because they don't they don't put that

855
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:19,450
outside say hey that's what welcome to

856
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:19,449
court is just about justice

857
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:28,520
so go ahead and so he starts humming oh

858
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:31,070
yeah this is Rick getting his award the

859
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,179
year before from our honor so I'm like

860
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,320
you know what you have us learn

861
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:35,780
something send you pictures like this

862
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,610
you're like this I thought I wanted to

863
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:40,240
do was like work over here by myself I'm

864
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:42,860
like you know what's going on

865
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:46,638
so the FBI's our pants down and you

866
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:50,570
think naively oh my god now no they

867
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:53,090
nothing fazes these people so we have to

868
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:55,190
reverse engineer the whole thing and we

869
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:57,740
start learning more and more from FOIA

870
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:59,450
and Rick and other things that's gone on

871
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:01,549
for the same time is going to tear

872
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:03,589
through the fact that we found that at

873
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:07,430
this point that what happened was the

874
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:09,619
FTC was sitting at that hearing in 2007

875
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:11,930
and later 2009 learning about all this

876
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:13,880
stuff freaked out they're responsible

877
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:15,589
they want typers to cooperate with him

878
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,800
and give them all those big bad

879
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:20,900
companies and diversity doesn't want to

880
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,670
do it because tigresses working with the

881
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:26,210
FBI and they don't want to be known as

882
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:28,910
like this thing right and so they set up

883
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:30,770
a false company called the privacy

884
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:35,750
Institute and Delta diversity us and

885
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:37,759
then the FTC subpoenas that fake group

886
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:40,040
so that no one can get all these files

887
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,450
back so they turn over about a hundred

888
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:45,170
companies remember that prior

889
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:47,270
personalized so this all comes from that

890
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:48,080
so these are taken right that's some

891
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,810
other steamroller

892
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:52,790
and they also include that they include

893
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:54,650
this but they took this this was not in

894
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:59,330
the hundred but this is where they also

895
00:35:54,650 --> 00:36:03,260
took they also found Barack Obama's

896
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:05,000
helicopter plans and they couldn't cover

897
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:07,130
up a bomb and say hey we got your stuff

898
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,680
you want to pay this so instead they

899
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:12,380
monetize that by telling the press what

900
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,779
happened and it was if you googled you

901
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:16,250
cool of this you'll see a lot of big

902
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,829
anchors and we see if I can unbirth name

903
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:19,989
right now not right away

904
00:36:17,829 --> 00:36:21,849
anyway doing a whole story on this like

905
00:36:19,989 --> 00:36:23,799
because there's only precedent for nine

906
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:24,640
weeks at this point it's all a complete

907
00:36:23,799 --> 00:36:27,249
lie

908
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,779
they found this in a work station in

909
00:36:27,249 --> 00:36:30,218
Maryland and they made up the IP

910
00:36:28,779 --> 00:36:32,319
addresses so no one could figure it out

911
00:36:30,219 --> 00:36:33,999
but now they got the wrong side know

912
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:36,099
everyone's doing it's starting to be

913
00:36:33,999 --> 00:36:37,868
like things don't add up but we don't

914
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:39,489
embarrass ourselves because we were

915
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:41,529
working with them as the government so

916
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:44,319
you know we'll just let this kind of

917
00:36:41,529 --> 00:36:47,799
fade away and I'm the big pinion of the

918
00:36:44,319 --> 00:36:49,660
but that won't stop fading away so I'm

919
00:36:47,799 --> 00:36:51,009
going to tear through the smart to get

920
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:54,190
to the end of this but the courts

921
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:57,549
basically when we go to court the rare

922
00:36:54,190 --> 00:37:00,009
times we get to court they lose but

923
00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:02,140
getting to court is nearly impossible

924
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:03,759
and tell me the government has their

925
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:06,430
hands where anything goes you can't get

926
00:37:03,759 --> 00:37:07,719
to court and so what he says them you

927
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:09,038
have no information establish how

928
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:09,759
evidence was obtained is that right

929
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:11,890
that's correct

930
00:37:09,759 --> 00:37:14,049
the reason I put this up here is if I

931
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:16,118
could tell you without evidence and in

932
00:37:14,049 --> 00:37:18,309
transcript that they don't need any

933
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:21,249
evidence to come at you think what year

934
00:37:18,309 --> 00:37:23,109
does bias near an axe to grind but this

935
00:37:21,249 --> 00:37:24,098
is what's in the transcript you don't

936
00:37:23,109 --> 00:37:24,729
know where the evidence came from you

937
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:25,719
don't know how these people got

938
00:37:24,729 --> 00:37:27,098
possession oh but you don't know whether

939
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:28,390
they originate from WebMD but you're

940
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:30,759
going to use that to show certain

941
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:35,140
individuals were damaged yes your honor

942
00:37:30,759 --> 00:37:36,640
holy cow but they get away with it

943
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:39,190
because where was the media stories on

944
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,739
this right where is it I mean it's okay

945
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:43,449
your court stuff so now I'm closing that

946
00:37:41,739 --> 00:37:45,690
thing hang on a second your planet is

947
00:37:43,449 --> 00:37:49,199
evidence of harm that's correct

948
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:51,749
do you - eventual penetration Network no

949
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:55,029
no we're not we do that and then

950
00:37:51,749 --> 00:37:56,709
understand Congress has said that the

951
00:37:55,029 --> 00:38:00,249
agency key makes the rules

952
00:37:56,709 --> 00:38:04,058
the judge is semi-autonomous he has to

953
00:38:00,249 --> 00:38:06,430
enforce their rules their rules are you

954
00:38:04,059 --> 00:38:08,650
can't see the standards of cybersecurity

955
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:10,509
that you're supposed to comply let me

956
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:12,279
say that again you can't see the

957
00:38:10,509 --> 00:38:14,619
standards for cybersecurity for what

958
00:38:12,279 --> 00:38:17,259
you're supposed to comply so when we

959
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:19,719
asked for suppose that the FTC are the

960
00:38:17,259 --> 00:38:21,400
courts order provides at WebMD may not

961
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:23,019
discovered legal stands at that EC has

962
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,749
used the pass is currently using enforce

963
00:38:23,019 --> 00:38:27,640
section 5 cases if I would have had that

964
00:38:25,749 --> 00:38:28,899
from quotes of a transcript I guarantee

965
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:32,680
you you wouldn't believe me I'm gonna

966
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:34,690
believe me because what this is it's

967
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:36,098
just you know even my lawyers were like

968
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:38,319
I don't know what world I'm in here I

969
00:38:36,099 --> 00:38:39,509
don't know because they're not it's

970
00:38:38,319 --> 00:38:42,999
crazy

971
00:38:39,509 --> 00:38:45,549
so Jim finally we get like year goes by

972
00:38:42,999 --> 00:38:47,529
or trying to get break the fifth and he

973
00:38:45,549 --> 00:38:50,469
comes in everything I'm sorry he comes

974
00:38:47,529 --> 00:38:52,449
in right away plead the fifth the case

975
00:38:50,469 --> 00:38:53,799
gets stayed everyone goes crazy we

976
00:38:52,449 --> 00:38:56,319
wanted me in for him to take him to get

977
00:38:53,799 --> 00:38:58,089
to Congress Darryl ices all up in arms

978
00:38:56,319 --> 00:38:59,589
because he was lied to this hearing was

979
00:38:58,089 --> 00:39:02,109
his committees that were lied to

980
00:38:59,589 --> 00:39:03,670
he gets what's going on so he starts

981
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:07,479
having investigations they bring in hard

982
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:09,369
drives with the data to Congress these

983
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:11,049
people hop in on the other side senator

984
00:39:09,369 --> 00:39:12,190
Rockefeller hops in ways that had been

985
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:14,440
in the house representatives

986
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:16,319
Elijah Cummings they had guy Susan

987
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,400
Sexton groups the head lawyer for the

988
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:20,558
Oversight Committee on the Democratic

989
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,289
side you know they they killed

990
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:25,359
everything they won't look at the hard

991
00:39:23,289 --> 00:39:27,339
drives that have all this national

992
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:29,259
series to find that's how they get to

993
00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:31,839
say they're not involved they don't know

994
00:39:29,259 --> 00:39:34,809
they don't like I don't know they don't

995
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:37,509
say I'm making sure I don't know they

996
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:39,519
just won't look and they went never

997
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:44,589
going to go and they rode out the clock

998
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:47,529
on Isis term so we couldn't get to any

999
00:39:44,589 --> 00:39:49,839
immunity for record and this good

1000
00:39:47,529 --> 00:39:52,660
journalism of the few journalists to

1001
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:53,190
every in the room for the full hearing

1002
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:55,319
in front of house

1003
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:56,790
our site you know you're gonna have a

1004
00:39:55,319 --> 00:39:57,720
house oversight marrying the full

1005
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:59,730
commission and there anything that

1006
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,520
c-span we're gonna pay attention it

1007
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:03,810
doesn't happen and because they're kind

1008
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,420
of afraid of who they're going to tick

1009
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:08,640
off and the other side is a proactive

1010
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:10,980
circle and confuse of the media and

1011
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,589
these guys these these journalists can't

1012
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:20,579
follow technology so they just go I

1013
00:40:13,589 --> 00:40:22,410
don't understand out of the blue I still

1014
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:24,599
don't know the Justice Department gave

1015
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:28,140
the judge permission to award record

1016
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:30,599
unity when Congress couldn't do it so he

1017
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:32,879
gets immunity he testifies and they had

1018
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:34,740
also results in ice up putting out this

1019
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,060
large report which is on my website if

1020
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:37,890
you want to read that report it really

1021
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:39,509
is amazing but what's amazing about us

1022
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:42,569
what's in it and what's amazing about it

1023
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:44,490
snows report is it tiburce and the FTC

1024
00:40:42,569 --> 00:40:45,869
had a quid pro quo relationship the

1025
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:48,000
typers would give the FTC companies to

1026
00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:49,920
chase the prosecute FTC would tell tech

1027
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,020
versa information at companies that they

1028
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,819
were investigating so that Tigers would

1029
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:55,140
come and go hey you know it's private

1030
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:56,579
but they told us we're investigating

1031
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:58,319
with its tool you might want to buy they

1032
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:01,609
might like it better millions of dollars

1033
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:04,710
in contracts that's how they got paid

1034
00:41:01,609 --> 00:41:05,970
and the court of closing arguments was

1035
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:08,069
so I'm clear the government doesn't

1036
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:11,578
position isn't breeches office requires

1037
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:13,920
no regions not required it so you can

1038
00:41:11,579 --> 00:41:15,240
have your data and no bridges so we

1039
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,530
break it off I know you guys don't know

1040
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:19,560
that I'm started repeating myself right

1041
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:22,859
they talk to that work right so all

1042
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:26,279
right moving right along

1043
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:31,290
FBI raids I'm in RSA everyone's like

1044
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:33,359
yeah we FTC oh we're the Eleventh

1045
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:35,069
Circuit overturns I think we won there's

1046
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,930
no there's there's a tough investigation

1047
00:41:35,069 --> 00:41:38,009
going on and we're stepping appeals for

1048
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:40,890
everything starts everything in slow

1049
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:43,140
motion everything is really impactful it

1050
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:45,089
takes a year because the appeals process

1051
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:46,319
takes forever but we didn't win the

1052
00:41:45,089 --> 00:41:47,160
people at the media was getting kind of

1053
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,440
mad at me because if the

1054
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,430
crabby and I knew then I learned that

1055
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,900
I'm gonna write about their crabby

1056
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:55,410
because I'm like what do we win

1057
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:58,290
companies gone we lost a job my dreams

1058
00:41:55,410 --> 00:42:00,810
destroyed city let me win no apologies

1059
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:05,400
can't sue him they'll community oh yeah

1060
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:08,330
we want sure and then and this is I'm

1061
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:11,310
sorry what we won was that the ALJ

1062
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:16,980
Senate put out a 93 page scathing

1063
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:18,990
opinion against the FTC and the FTC or

1064
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:20,790
was I don't was thank them never overall

1065
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:23,609
this and they overruled it so now I

1066
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:27,950
think so they jumped the shark they just

1067
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:32,420
basically made up the rules by saying

1068
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:36,029
intangible harm is a tangible harm

1069
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:41,040
because your anxiety of your data may be

1070
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:42,510
being out is a tangible harm and really

1071
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,250
this is what they do they make these

1072
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:45,750
cockamamie and crazy things to the real

1073
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:47,070
things going on us I think we're going

1074
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:48,510
to keep you in court a few more years a

1075
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:49,800
few million dollars that's we're going

1076
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:51,540
to hear we're going to see we're on this

1077
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:55,380
marathon to see who dies before the

1078
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:57,930
finish line and so I'm happy this

1079
00:42:55,380 --> 00:43:00,780
written articles report rose and great

1080
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:03,060
comes in roasting gray was who took the

1081
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:04,620
target cases Sony case so they did this

1082
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:08,220
whole pro bono defense no it's not my

1083
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:10,890
case is kind of big and sexy and this is

1084
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:13,109
just one of the arguments you sissy so

1085
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:14,640
the court says does to the FTC lawyer

1086
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:16,230
doesn't that underscore the importance

1087
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,790
of us significance of rulemaking

1088
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:20,400
otherwise you're wrangling data on a

1089
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:22,020
case-by-case basis we are regulating the

1090
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,790
security and case-by-case basis that's

1091
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:25,560
exactly what the Supreme Court says and

1092
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:27,960
it doesn't matter whether subjects is

1093
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:30,840
any notice at all that's correct

1094
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:32,520
so notice is irrelevant correct you can

1095
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,990
adopt the rules and adjudication that

1096
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,400
means you get to make up the laws you go

1097
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:38,279
along after you've arrested the person

1098
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,660
that's what that means the Supreme Court

1099
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,130
made that very clear and the judge

1100
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:43,440
slapped in their face each other I

1101
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:46,320
appreciate your concessions but the

1102
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:49,130
point is tell us lawyers will argue that

1103
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:51,560
crazy stuff because 1988

1104
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:53,960
people will before you get to court like

1105
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,920
this every major company is going to

1106
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:58,250
listen to where you go

1107
00:43:54,920 --> 00:44:00,590
now we'll just fall so even though I

1108
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:05,840
didn't fold and I won they're going to

1109
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:07,640
change cuz everybody folds so it's had

1110
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:10,010
impact level certainty now now this is

1111
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:11,690
the language of the legal community no

1112
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:13,130
one is paying any attention to the

1113
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:15,560
corruption around there all this running

1114
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:17,300
about the legal impact and so basically

1115
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,830
FTC decision reigns in the abuse of

1116
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:20,360
authority issue broadly worded to tell

1117
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:21,950
defined orders that's the bottom line

1118
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:24,730
all that fight to the rest the world is

1119
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:26,990
now they can't just make stuff up I

1120
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:28,610
didn't get a thank-you note from anyone

1121
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:30,080
in the fortune 500 by the way even

1122
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:34,100
though this has saved them billions of

1123
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:35,810
dollars but nothing glad needs them okay

1124
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:37,220
so now it goes oh you wanna be one now

1125
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:40,640
you can just super millions to be rich

1126
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:42,230
forever right no they have a manatee so

1127
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,609
100 years of these people have given

1128
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:45,740
themselves all sorts of immunity because

1129
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:46,880
you know they get to make mistakes but I

1130
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:48,799
think they felt accountable for their

1131
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,870
mistakes and destroying people the notes

1132
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,570
that one work for the government that's

1133
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:55,880
what they say all the time so this is

1134
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:57,170
the pie chart of all the litigation we

1135
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:00,380
have going on now trying to get

1136
00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:01,910
accountability back because people think

1137
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:03,350
everything's over now and I just sit

1138
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:07,100
home and you know write my next book

1139
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:08,660
wrong and so there's two tracks of

1140
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:10,250
things that we learn I'm going to sum

1141
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:12,890
this stuff what's happened since okay

1142
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:14,450
there's two basically things that have

1143
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:16,250
helped because courts have done nothing

1144
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:19,669
for us everything we've learned is

1145
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:21,940
through proof own investigations the

1146
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:25,160
congressional investigation FOIA and

1147
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:29,330
putting things together and then and

1148
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:32,120
this Mary Beth you can okay rolling back

1149
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:33,860
to Rick Wallace where that the cannon

1150
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,589
turns out to have been the US Attorney

1151
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:37,469
at the

1152
00:45:34,589 --> 00:45:38,400
time when ty versa was working with the

1153
00:45:37,469 --> 00:45:43,140
Pittsburgh FBI

1154
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:48,059
in 2000 the 2000 Republican Bush

1155
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:50,038
administration really pitbull goes after

1156
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:50,670
and she wants to make child porn her

1157
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:52,589
thing

1158
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:54,299
he just googled a big profile of her in

1159
00:45:52,589 --> 00:45:57,859
The New York Times at a full story

1160
00:45:54,299 --> 00:46:02,880
telephone hearing save the world so

1161
00:45:57,859 --> 00:46:05,009
that's fine I hear about her in 2015

1162
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:08,400
when Rick is torn through two law firms

1163
00:46:05,009 --> 00:46:10,440
already one at which was given $100,000

1164
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,960
by the people that were defending me and

1165
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:15,239
the guy talked through it like six weeks

1166
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,640
and scammed the other one does too you

1167
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:22,019
can't you gotta collect the client here

1168
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:25,739
who is terrified and so all sorts of

1169
00:46:22,019 --> 00:46:27,988
inner stress and he's trying to make

1170
00:46:25,739 --> 00:46:30,539
right of terrible things that he's done

1171
00:46:27,989 --> 00:46:33,390
and he can't get out of this this thing

1172
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:35,869
he is the singer changing these IP

1173
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:38,549
addresses and manipulating this data and

1174
00:46:35,869 --> 00:46:40,140
purchasing this scheming he's he's only

1175
00:46:38,549 --> 00:46:42,119
seeing the carnage from what he did to a

1176
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:44,609
cancer detection center so he's in this

1177
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:46,559
whole crazy beating himself up thing so

1178
00:46:44,609 --> 00:46:49,499
he's hard to handle for lawyers who are

1179
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:51,839
not therapists by the way and so it took

1180
00:46:49,499 --> 00:46:53,578
a while so he calls Mary Beth mechanic

1181
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:57,150
is that's the only learning he knew that

1182
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:58,890
would understand and believe him and we

1183
00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:00,390
never realized at the time none of my

1184
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:02,400
lawyers knew that that's a kind of a

1185
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:03,719
felony when you're when you were working

1186
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,609
in the executive branch and then later

1187
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:08,609
you come the same case that that's a

1188
00:47:05,609 --> 00:47:11,700
felony but she did and we later found

1189
00:47:08,609 --> 00:47:14,700
out so so so at the time during my

1190
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:17,308
hearing she talked to one of my lawyers

1191
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:20,038
and taught them in the fact that rick

1192
00:47:17,309 --> 00:47:22,589
has his one shot at complete immunity

1193
00:47:20,039 --> 00:47:24,839
when he goes on this stand and he gets

1194
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:27,150
to happy as the court has heard it and

1195
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:29,460
my lawyers don't really like Rick or

1196
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:32,160
don't get it so she proposes that she be

1197
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:34,019
allowed in my case to do the cross or

1198
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,430
redirect on him to pull everything out

1199
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:37,109
and she puts it

1200
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:38,759
her letter to the court asking herself

1201
00:47:37,109 --> 00:47:41,490
to have anything we allow her to do it

1202
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:43,770
because brick was important to me and I

1203
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:45,140
agree with her and so what happens she

1204
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:48,660
gets up there to dope

1205
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:50,578
my lawyers been missing and so that's a

1206
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:52,740
short version of I ended up suing her

1207
00:47:50,579 --> 00:47:55,920
and am suing her because we believe now

1208
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:58,709
she headed this whole thing to protect

1209
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:02,220
her convictions the reputation of the

1210
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:04,079
FBI the Justice Department and just to

1211
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,828
keep her out of jail in her mind of rich

1212
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:07,410
stayed out of jail

1213
00:48:04,829 --> 00:48:10,200
everything else in this play oh and then

1214
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:11,460
cleared all up empty spaces that's a

1215
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,240
winner and in the Freedom of Information

1216
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:16,050
Act

1217
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:18,118
we found her meeting with the FTC six

1218
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:19,500
days before the testimony now I don't

1219
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:21,210
know about for you if you guys know much

1220
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,440
about FOIA but you know FOIA is supposed

1221
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:24,510
to be for Information Act but that's a

1222
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:27,240
redaction party where they just you get

1223
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:30,420
all this stuff redacted well what

1224
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:33,439
happens is luckily and this has never

1225
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:36,000
happened before the FOIA came fast and

1226
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,010
like ten pages were adapted the table

1227
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,650
were unredacted at the bottom and it was

1228
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:44,280
a treasure trove of stuff so we learned

1229
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:46,109
a lot about having proof the second part

1230
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:48,329
is the big bomb that happened that we

1231
00:48:46,109 --> 00:48:50,098
didn't really learn until two years ago

1232
00:48:48,329 --> 00:49:03,420
and this is sort of the close of this

1233
00:48:50,099 --> 00:49:05,369
but okay all right something never fit

1234
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:07,650
with this whole thing but knowing the

1235
00:49:05,369 --> 00:49:10,920
technology experience got involved and

1236
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:12,349
my lawyers early on didn't do any

1237
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:16,049
investigation

1238
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:18,270
hindsight's 2020 to stage one okay so I

1239
00:49:16,049 --> 00:49:21,509
had an attorney who said we actually

1240
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:25,400
researched all the patents and all the

1241
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:25,400
information about peer-to-peer networks

1242
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:34,740
and they researched all this and any and

1243
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,720
said this doesn't fit you

1244
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:39,359
my wire doesn't work like the NTC say

1245
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:41,459
it's working it just it can't find

1246
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:42,839
something our Father was insurance aging

1247
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:43,950
that event they couldn't have possibly

1248
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:46,500
done it that way

1249
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:48,060
and so I called up Rick now by this time

1250
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:51,000
you know I've seelix houses bought my

1251
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:58,109
plane here to Iowa you know we have

1252
00:49:51,000 --> 00:50:00,000
friendship and I set him okay when the

1253
00:49:58,109 --> 00:50:03,420
FTC one they have to see overturn their

1254
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:06,960
judge they said in their ruling lab MD

1255
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:09,150
admitted using line wire like software

1256
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,339
now by this time I know these are

1257
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:13,250
pathological liars and if they've got my

1258
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:16,619
market light instead of LimeWire

1259
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:18,900
sometimes up and so I called him and I

1260
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:24,060
said what do you think us well we use

1261
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:26,609
this open source code no said okay so

1262
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:28,349
climb our well that's like landmark okay

1263
00:50:26,609 --> 00:50:30,180
so if it's open source code and you

1264
00:50:28,349 --> 00:50:32,310
think it's LimeWire legally it's not

1265
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:34,560
mine standing in these lawnmower so what

1266
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:41,400
do well it was an investigation software

1267
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:42,570
from the FBI so now I call my other boy

1268
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:45,000
I'll skip over some time but basically

1269
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:46,470
this is this created this world war

1270
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,420
three because evidently some of my

1271
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:51,060
attorneys in some other cases seem to

1272
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:53,400
have known this and had what they

1273
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:58,080
thought was an obligation not to tell me

1274
00:50:53,400 --> 00:51:00,630
and we we went that lawsuit with Mary

1275
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:03,900
Beth Buchanan that we sued her accusing

1276
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:06,480
her of this type of you know for

1277
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:08,910
tortious interference and all sorts of

1278
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,980
violations basically she just lied to me

1279
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:12,690
when she did this whole cross thing and

1280
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:14,849
this whole thing's been manipulation and

1281
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:16,400
he was so mad because we didn't accuse

1282
00:51:14,849 --> 00:51:19,789
him in the content in the

1283
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:21,470
the case and then the lawsuit but

1284
00:51:19,789 --> 00:51:24,140
Reuters Werth is the big article about

1285
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:25,970
it and the way they worded it it sounded

1286
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:29,058
like they're kind of including him so

1287
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:31,069
he's furious and he's chewing me out me

1288
00:51:29,059 --> 00:51:32,960
sending me text get a life or mental

1289
00:51:31,069 --> 00:51:35,150
you're crazy this is terrible and then

1290
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:37,309
after while he's ripping me a new one he

1291
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:38,089
gives me Christmas and an email and says

1292
00:51:37,309 --> 00:51:43,359
you're stupid

1293
00:51:38,089 --> 00:51:46,549
we used a p2p well a p2p is software

1294
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:49,308
developed by the FBI FBI to to child

1295
00:51:46,549 --> 00:51:52,450
porn investigations and we just had so

1296
00:51:49,309 --> 00:51:52,450
now we know aha

1297
00:51:52,599 --> 00:51:57,619
so you know what's LimeWire it never was

1298
00:51:55,849 --> 00:52:00,890
Posey available that's how they could

1299
00:51:57,619 --> 00:52:02,799
have gotten it and the FTC used FBI

1300
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:04,519
software that's used for FBI

1301
00:52:02,799 --> 00:52:10,910
