1
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:22,180
oh I don't believe so let's cerebrate

2
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,180
classy

3
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:38,589
location the moment service question

4
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:44,319
what is location oh it's a fruit

5
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:47,680
so as a profession or is it location you

6
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,870
don't necessarily have to be a

7
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,239
professional or working for field to be

8
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:54,129
part of the location or a professional

9
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,680
of that career so we don't usually use

10
00:00:54,130 --> 00:01:02,770
versus profession that's what you do but

11
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:17,200
start security can extend beyond that is

12
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:18,580
a common practice so you got 1033 and I

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,980
know we don't have a whole lot of time

14
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:24,640
everybody so as people come in that's

15
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:25,350
okay but I am JT Henry I work for the

16
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,700
Department of Homeland Security

17
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,360
cybersecurity and destruction Security

18
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,490
Agency

19
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,310
I am the cyber security adviser for the

20
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:37,479
region Sun region seven covers

21
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:39,250
Iowa Kansas Missouri and Nebraska I go

22
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,510
around and I work mostly with the

23
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:44,160
structure and we'll talk about what that

24
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:46,660
is and I deal a lot with utilities and

25
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,720
ICS and skatin will talk a little bit

26
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:51,039
about how that what that means so

27
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,120
today's topic and what I'm going to talk

28
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,060
to you about about the next ten minutes

29
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,380
is cyber security location whether or

30
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,450
not you're going to it as a profession

31
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:01,000
or whether or not it's just a practice

32
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:04,390
that you use in your job because your

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,250
job will all most definitely include

34
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:09,580
cyber security in one shape or form or

35
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:12,190
another so everybody here I mean looking

36
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:15,310
around mostly younger students I can see

37
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:18,910
so I'll - I'll tell you where I started

38
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:21,370
so so that's a little me that's probably

39
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:25,329
around 1986 that I can tell it's about

40
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:29,170
1986 because this is a Commodore 64 came

41
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:31,540
out right around 1982 1983

42
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:35,530
that's an Amiga it didn't come out till

43
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:37,090
1985 so I know exactly that then Amiga

44
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,560
had a color monitor as opposed

45
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,060
just the green-screen it took three and

46
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,520
a half inch floppies instead of the five

47
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,500
reporters you'll see I'm putting in a

48
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:48,910
body quarter disk there's a joystick

49
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:50,650
really nice dot matrix printer and this

50
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:53,579
was the specs the basic specs on a

51
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:55,780
Commodore 64 so one point zero two

52
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,200
megahertz is what the processing speed

53
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:01,120
of that was and 64 kilobytes of RAM

54
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,780
pretty good for $600 back then that's a

55
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,540
lot of RAM for a personal computer give

56
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,819
you an idea of what my Galaxy S nine or

57
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:12,250
my kids Xbox one is you start seeing

58
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:14,589
that megahertz jump in two gigahertz and

59
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,840
then you start seeing RAM also jump from

60
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:19,480
that kilobit all the way down to two

61
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,010
gigabit and the display display

62
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,840
obviously for the Xbox because it's

63
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:28,630
whatever monitor you're using where your

64
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:32,580
4k by a LCD or but it regardless you'll

65
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:35,650
see that the color schemes from quad HD

66
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,810
65,536 possible color schemes as opposed

67
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:41,829
to the 16 colors that my Commodore could

68
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:44,019
actually deal to support you'll see that

69
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:45,430
that's good that trend has continued we

70
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:48,220
always say that eventually it's going to

71
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:49,600
slow down it never has and we don't see

72
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,250
anything with the way that we were

73
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,079
actually making chips today and then the

74
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,760
silicon that we're using and the way

75
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,709
that we're creating more transistors

76
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,410
onto those chips and be able to process

77
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:01,720
more and more data there is no slowdown

78
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:03,280
and more data can process the more

79
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,440
exposed to be are to be able to lose

80
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,370
that data and the more risk we have for

81
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:12,579
cybersecurity so why do I do what I do

82
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:15,430
for Department Homeland Security so this

83
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:16,810
is an Aurora generator and I'm going to

84
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,930
show you a little video I talked about

85
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:24,370
this and Aurora generator is used within

86
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:25,840
the power grid and in 2007 the Idaho

87
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,550
National Labs is part of Department

88
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,929
Homeland Security I wanted to see

89
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,690
whether or not they can do a destructive

90
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:35,870
effect on a physical asset using nothing

91
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:41,810
but cybersecurity and

92
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:41,810
good switch video

93
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,680
No

94
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,689
[Music]

95
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,569
the video

96
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,960
all right so the Aurora generator think

97
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,370
I've set up their dual monitors I think

98
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,370
it's part of my problem

99
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:52,540
what version - you money this time

100
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:53,860
problem is Department my security has

101
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,650
done an excellent job to lock you down

102
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,420
this machine so that I cannot go ahead

103
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,700
and do a lot of the things to my bedded

104
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:04,510
links that I put in a PowerPoint hmm

105
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:09,960
all those things have been disabled here

106
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:09,960
we go I inserted for Bill monitors

107
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:25,200
that's it so this is a ruler generator

108
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:28,440
it cost about a million dollars if

109
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:31,320
they're 21 lines of code they did this

110
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,090
in 2007 so 2011 21 lines of code they're

111
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,640
able to affect the relays on this

112
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:38,159
generator the generator itself you're

113
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,320
gonna see it as a big spinning rod let's

114
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,880
trade electricity and it has three

115
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,130
different faces weighs more than a dump

116
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,650
truck you see it jumping it's really

117
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:49,530
happen is its parent self aside as part

118
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:52,289
of the stock it's exploding because

119
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:54,989
you're taking those faces out it's

120
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,980
creating a lot of centripetal force it's

121
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,250
being able to pull in different

122
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:00,990
directions on that rod and they did this

123
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,970
with 21 lines of code they're just

124
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,680
affecting the circuit breakers can you

125
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:06,990
see the spokes so it is actually

126
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,780
exploding on the inside you'll see now

127
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:11,400
the valves are starting to break this

128
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:17,270
was all done via cycle

129
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:19,710
nobody touched it we remoted in 2007

130
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,659
2007 that's and you'll see here's the

131
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:23,940
blast walls in case it did actually

132
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,800
explode or crack the actual chassis in

133
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,320
the case you know that's not the size of

134
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,970
a major you know bulldozer so to see a

135
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,520
jump like that you're lifting about

136
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,900
10,000 pounds that's how much force is

137
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:40,190
going on inside and that's what affects

138
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:45,239
our power grid so we give that to

139
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:47,340
presentation and so that's one of the

140
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,800
things we were trying to protect against

141
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,409
so that we want to make sure that

142
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,500
incidents like this gravely does more

143
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:58,680
than catch arrows we promise the next

144
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:01,290
day might be good no perfect works but

145
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:04,130
if you're ready to shine or explicit or

146
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,130
excellent or

147
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:16,669
so we had a power outage in 2003 that

148
00:08:14,719 --> 00:08:18,199
the Northwest blackout it started

149
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:21,650
something similar very much to this

150
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:24,199
generator so that entire power grid the

151
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:26,479
eastern interconnect which covers most

152
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:28,370
of the United States here on the eastern

153
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,530
coast from the Mississippi over and into

154
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:35,630
Canada started to have cascading

155
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:38,899
blackouts I say that because this was in

156
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:40,399
2003 that that incident occurred 2007 is

157
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:44,029
when we proved that we could actually do

158
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,690
it in 2015 the Ukraine on December 23rd

159
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:49,790
had a power outage affected almost

160
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:51,550
230,000 people and what happened was is

161
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,630
that attackers were able to get in

162
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:55,699
manipulate the systems to start turning

163
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:58,160
off breakers to three different power

164
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,990
utilities and just before Christmas they

165
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,110
were able to turn off all of their power

166
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:06,170
throughout the six hours that was with

167
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:08,990
an alert variant called black energy the

168
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:11,420
following year on December 17th the

169
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:14,420
attackers came back in they used a much

170
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:17,209
more sophisticated means of what's

171
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:19,579
called in destroyer or crash override a

172
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:22,010
malware family that was specifically

173
00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:25,189
designed to target the power grid so

174
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:26,740
that exists now and it's very terrifying

175
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:30,170
that somebody has those kind of

176
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:31,579
abilities field would go in and the kiev

177
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:34,849
attack on the power transportation

178
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:37,609
system it did not even have all of the

179
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,680
actual modules that it could do turned

180
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,240
on so it could have been much more

181
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,099
devastating it looked at more like they

182
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,459
were just testing its capability to see

183
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:48,550
whether or not it was a proof of concept

184
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:50,739
good attack and then after 2016 you also

185
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:53,559
see a lot more problems within the

186
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:55,809
Ukraine as far as actual Romania you see

187
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:58,059
a lot of political things that happen so

188
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:59,949
a lot of these things you'll see are

189
00:09:58,059 --> 00:10:02,379
sometimes precursors to even much more

190
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:04,359
wide scale kinetic or physical type of

191
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:05,980
tax so those are the things that

192
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,689
Homeland Security is looking at pretty

193
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:11,110
much every day and how we protect

194
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:12,550
critical infrastructure rely on so when

195
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,559
I talk about critical infrastructure I'm

196
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:16,689
talking about these 16 different things

197
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,490
whether or not it's your drinking water

198
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:20,170
to make sure it's clean or wastewater is

199
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,730
being managed correctly whether or not

200
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,889
it's your energy and power like we're

201
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,809
talking about the dams critical

202
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:27,100
manufacturing used to be able to produce

203
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:29,829
the goods and services you need

204
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,509
healthcare there's a lot of difference

205
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:34,420
we talk about to be rely on it every

206
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:36,100
single day and we take for granted but

207
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:39,009
those are the things that I focus with

208
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:42,399
on my table so why is that important for

209
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:43,929
you guys and why do I bring that up the

210
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,499
cyber security in the workforce is

211
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:49,990
undergoing a huge challenge and they say

212
00:10:47,499 --> 00:10:51,279
but by 2022 we were going to be in a

213
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:54,129
workforce shortage of cybersecurity

214
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,749
professionals got 1.8 million people so

215
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:57,610
there's definitely a room and we

216
00:10:55,749 --> 00:10:59,199
definitely need more and more people to

217
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:02,139
start looking this at this is a vocation

218
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:03,849
whether that's the IT side or it's the

219
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:06,720
operational technology that I deal with

220
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:09,879
in the critical infrastructure side

221
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:13,269
alone and the far right you'll see in

222
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:16,240
Iowa currently there's already 2,400

223
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:17,410
jobs that are vacant right now that are

224
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,600
being posted for cybersecurity

225
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:21,309
professionals in the state of Iowa so

226
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,079
there's definitely room for if you guys

227
00:11:21,309 --> 00:11:25,360
are interested in this as a profession

228
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:27,248
and we would love bill but you know make

229
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,990
sure that we can help and grow so

230
00:11:27,249 --> 00:11:31,059
Homeland Security also partners with the

231
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:33,309
National Security Agency we have cyber

232
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:34,480
Corps which are scholarship programs to

233
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:36,699
where we'll help pay for your school

234
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,709
give you a stipend and just you will

235
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:40,569
provide three I think it's three years

236
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:42,309
of service to the Federal service

237
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:43,530
there's centers for academic excellence

238
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:45,510
and different universe

239
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,949
throughout the country so we were really

240
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:49,110
trying to address this workforce

241
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:51,470
challenge that's a little bit about what

242
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:54,150
I do I'm going about 45 minutes and

243
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:56,040

248
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,210
with your homework or your something

249
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,220

250
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:07,650
you know there's my email address I'll

251

252
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:13,470

questions I'll be here I'll be speaking

259
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,230
again on the other room at one o'clock

260
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,910
today are the different resources that

261
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:41,790
we provide some critical infrastructure

262
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:44,100
I usually provide some things we

263
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:46,140
determine provider decks we provide a

264
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,980
different resource set that goes through

265
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:52,020
HR External Affairs all those things

266
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,310
yeah yeah so they have to approve all

267
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:57,170
that so they have their own messaging

268
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:57,170
they don't like a nice share like videos

269
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:12,209
so with that I am gonna hand it over day

270
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:14,480
right oh yeah that's a good spot

271
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:14,479
cars
