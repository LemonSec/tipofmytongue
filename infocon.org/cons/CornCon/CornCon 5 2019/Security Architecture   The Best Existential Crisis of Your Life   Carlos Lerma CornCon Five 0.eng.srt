1
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:12,750
welcome back this is our second speaker

2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,610
Carlos Clermont many of us talk about

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:18,210
good friend he's become an affront a

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:22,230
since the very beginning and most people

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:24,750
I think not as diverse the Corcovado we

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:28,769
dis appreciated for many lines never

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,679
stop always entertaining that's him up

8
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:32,850
afterwards for autographs

9
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:35,370
they'll be valuable someday

10
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:42,300
well nameless good morning how are you

11
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:45,120
guys doing I can view you walked into a

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,038
funeral parlor huh well anyways I think

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,649
I'm also going to be talking about an

14
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,480
existential crisis from an architecture

15
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:53,430
architecture point of view I'm going to

16
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,680
outlive a lot of this stuff I usually do

17
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,600
so feel free though you know cut in

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,320
Interop asking me how many questions you

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,469
might have

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,629
why are we talking about this especially

21
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,299
the security architecture is one field

22
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:08,820
that is getting a lot of exposure is

23
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,680
getting a lot of traction Ami's we are

24
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,270
sitting right between the business and

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,820
security I'm trying to think about

26
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,009
things in a different way to try all

27
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,320
these neat little gizmos and stuff that

28
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,900
we used to play for every single day

29
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,600
into a business plan and everything into

30
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,270
a business landscape and that's pretty

31
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,658
much what I'm here to talk about right

32
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:35,090
honesty the views here are my own cannot

33
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,090
represent also employee

34
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,719
and by the way I'm not an expert I'm

35
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:43,548
just like you guys I am sitting in the

36
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:44,630
best every single morning trying to

37
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:46,729
figure things out

38
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,140
bumping my head against the whole bunch

39
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:51,020
of stuff and asking a lot of questions

40
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:53,149
so pretty much if you're looking for an

41
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:55,340
expert thing up the talk that's not it's

42
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:56,780
going to be much more of an exchange of

43
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:01,219
ideas and trying to wrap our heads

44
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:03,049
around a lot of concepts okay so what

45
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:05,408
are we talking about here so what is

46
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:07,880
exactly spirit lecture why do we eat

47
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:12,079
surgery architects we're going to go

48
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,670
through three existential crisis for my

49
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:18,010
experience and what is the road ahead

50
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:18,010
for us in the next couple down years

51
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:26,679
it's a way security architecture it's

52
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:29,989
not contextual I think that's the thing

53
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,549
good so what it is it's a designer of

54
00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:32,780
fact that scrub up security tools are

55
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:36,920
positioned how they relate to the

56
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:38,900
overall architecture the big purpose is

57
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,208
to maintain the systems quality and then

58
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:46,040
so it's pretty much at 10,000 feet view

59
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:47,660
of how security fits into legislate the

60
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,120
business lens people in systems

61
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,620
landscape of an organization once you

62
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,569
start thinking about our protector you

63
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,540
start thinking about the whole the whole

64
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:59,119
the organization and how security is

65
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,910
going to be embedded into certain

66
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,079
aspects of that organization

67
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,269
specifically this is very useful when

68
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:07,819
you start talking about a specific topic

69
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:09,769
to say how are we going to secure IOT

70
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:11,958
inside of the enterprise what is it that

71
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:13,819
I live to secure I owe t if I implement

72
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:17,209
that inside when are going to see a

73
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:18,798
longer the need logging multi-fiber on

74
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:21,760
vacation I mean the encryption of any

75
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:25,609
person at rest and in motion you need

76
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,319
logging off telling events all those

77
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:28,710
things that's you're pretty much going

78
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:30,839
up

79
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:33,480
you're looking at the big picture from

80
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,850
an architectural standpoint how you're

81
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,010
going to address those many points but

82
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:40,910
this is the time when you get to play

83
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:43,829
with those components and see which ones

84
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:45,930
operate or integrate better with the

85
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:48,870
landscape that you are studying are you

86
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:51,480
trying to analyze so that includes

87
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:54,090
somehow a graphical representation of

88
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,429
how security is built into the general

89
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:59,430
landscape like I said most of the time

90
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,110
this is some business achieved in a very

91
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,420
general form if you've ever seen the

92
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:05,730
statement for Doom up for motion control

93
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:08,190
systems that's pretty much a big

94
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:10,440
reputable representation of industrial

95
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,660
systems right once you take that model

96
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,760
and you turn it into a security

97
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:18,029
architecture model you're pretty much

98
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:22,019
putting security building blocks inside

99
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:23,719
of that big architectural common model

100
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:27,330
okay

101
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:29,670
as I said it can be specific to a part

102
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:31,440
of the general technical system might be

103
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,180
cloud services might be the databases

104
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,310
might be network software whatever and

105
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:42,030
you're going all the way up instead of

106
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:46,020
going down to specific components and

107
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:48,239
that's - and then when you think you've

108
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,700
got all covered boom and finally hit you

109
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:56,760
know that this is way worse than it is

110
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:58,800
next this is a very good insight on why

111
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,110
is that you have to understand when it

112
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,040
comes to security from a general form in

113
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:07,530
any single architecture this is these

114
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,030
don't mind map from sands I stumble

115
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,549
across this piece of knowledge being a

116
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:14,489
couple years ago and when I saw this at

117
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,930
blew my mind so in order to get software

118
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:19,020
when it comes to security from that

119
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:22,380
10,000 feet view this is only a small

120
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:24,430
case of what you actually have to think

121
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:29,430
about when you put the secure

122
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:33,070
lens into anything within 90 any sort of

123
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:35,110
aspect of the IT ecosystem this is the

124
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,310
stuff that you might have to consider as

125
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:39,670
a matter fact this is very good output

126
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:42,880
you can take a lot of things out as you

127
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:45,910
wish but most of these will be involved

128
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,040
in that analysis and this is the truck

129
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:50,620
this the sort of stuff that mark tries

130
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,480
to play with every day how many of these

131
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,130
things have I actually considered how

132
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,600
many of these things have I actually

133
00:05:54,130 --> 00:06:01,300
analyzed when it comes to the general

134
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:03,040
eco system basically now allistic this

135
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:07,000
takes me all the way back to form con

136
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,890
one five years ago does anybody here

137
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,600
internet if you know where this came

138
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:12,940
from

139
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,120
no one no one you do where'd it come

140
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,120
from

141
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:29,159
ah you know I love about these

142
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:30,810
no but that's perfect that and that's

143
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,090
amount of like that's that it's very

144
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:35,610
very close to the actual one god Bobby's

145
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:37,979
gets bookends him and he asked for

146
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,540
gentle situation on what Doug you know

147
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:42,240
what before the certain one what what

148
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:44,130
detailed picture is and someone has the

149
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,230
great idea moment no we need to go with

150
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:48,330
them with the one with one slide points

151
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:54,240
we come to you and they come up with

152
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:56,520
this holy now man but he's a very smart

153
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,280
guy he speaks with a perfect Russian and

154
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:02,030
a decent stuff you had the stuff that

155
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:07,919
say I need a minute to figure this out

156
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:09,840
and the exact same thing this is this is

157
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,159
sort of like the way that's the security

158
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,560
architecture integrates with the whole

159
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,880
thing your boss comes in that there's a

160
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,440
staple in speeding there so you know

161
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,419
about being at the port your deceased

162
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,210
soul or even a guy pretending to be this

163
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:23,099
you soul and someone says and give you a

164
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:24,780
general explanation how the security

165
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:28,560
posture in this organization is right

166
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:32,010
there this is what most people over and

167
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,200
yes you might have some very very smart

168
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:37,080
people sitting on that room but main

169
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:40,490
point is it is that kind of movement it

170
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:44,580
is that complicated and some of our

171
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:47,310
objectives have to do with clarifying

172
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:50,159
how security plates within the general

173
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:52,110
picture right and I'm going to tell you

174
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,970
how to do that but as I said this is

175
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:56,669
more this more of an art than a science

176
00:07:53,970 --> 00:08:00,030
it takes a lot of refinement it takes a

177
00:07:56,669 --> 00:08:03,780
very very a specific skill set that

178
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:05,669
cannot be tough you mostly get this from

179
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,799
the day to day of your security

180
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:10,440
operations from years of working

181
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,360
nineteen working in security working in

182
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,490
managerial positions but this is what

183
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:18,690
we're going to try to get to the next

184
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:20,010
place why these superior architects in

185
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,710
here that's more that's right explain

186
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:23,659
course

187
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,099
psycho phase right but I'm still gonna

188
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,800
help you out of factories

189
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,330
this is what we in superior to us first

190
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,180
of all because we need to build security

191
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:35,090
into business goals and processes the

192
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:38,120
best way to build security from an

193
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:42,290
architectural perspective is to build it

194
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:45,230
within business processes this better to

195
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:49,010
build it from the ground up instead of

196
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:52,910
having to bolt it on later on many

197
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:54,530
stages down the road right and that is a

198
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:56,420
nine rated process you actually have to

199
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,790
sit down with people and ask them what

200
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,870
is it that you're trying to accomplish

201
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:01,339
what this is the school are you trying

202
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:03,920
to remember because at the end of the

203
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,630
day the reason why we buy all these

204
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,060
night security gizmo is not for us to

205
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:10,070
blame them with theirs not for us to

206
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,800
like break them no it's actually because

207
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:15,260
we want to achieve a business goal

208
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:18,640
within within an organization and that

209
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:21,110
is the first step in order to get our

210
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,730
architectural career off the ground what

211
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:26,750
is it that you to understand security

212
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:28,850
from the ground up for I saw overview of

213
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,710
security to business stakeholders like

214
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:33,230
I've said it's pretty much on how you

215
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:34,790
explain that to other bunch of people

216
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,750
that do not know about security

217
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,969
sometimes they don't even care about

218
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,950
security but you actually have to sit

219
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,170
there and explain that to them and on

220
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:44,630
the other hand you have to sit with the

221
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:47,300
technical guys and tell them the reason

222
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:49,340
why you're doing this from your security

223
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:53,750
posture is because you're contributing

224
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:55,790
to these business objectives obviously

225
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:58,340
it's not easy because there's people

226
00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:00,349
that sit there from business stuff or

227
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:04,160
sit there to one technical stuff but you

228
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:05,990
still have to deliver the message but if

229
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,660
I make the risk in IT projects oh my god

230
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:11,780
this is this is so much fun but I'm

231
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:14,150
going again it's mainly ask what because

232
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,980
you have understand about risk sometimes

233
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:17,870
you think well I'm security things I'm

234
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,760
doing like my technical stuff they

235
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:21,220
prefer fire

236
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,780
think about you know Wi-Fi Protected

237
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:25,270
access and I'm doing all of this stuff

238
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:27,130
but I do not know how to put that in

239
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:31,240
terms that people can understand how

240
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:34,930
risky it is what I'm defending after

241
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,410
that you need a restaurant what we got

242
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,910
here

243
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:40,360
provides security solution to fix

244
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:44,260
budgets was ever had that problem racing

245
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:47,080
in horse that's that's pretty much the

246
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:50,200
everyday type of thing right or identify

247
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:52,180
existing solutions that can be reused or

248
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,910
can be repurposed which is pretty much

249
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,920
what we call application rationalization

250
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:58,449
I know all of these have the features in

251
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,969
here that I don't know what that what

252
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:02,530
they do we need to reduce the number of

253
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,270
those we can actually lower the cost

254
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:07,319
ownership but we can still make a

255
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:09,880
company more secure by doing so

256
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,710
controllable you turn it against machine

257
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:15,370
man patrol the past controls the future

258
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:17,080
but that's on if you do you might be in

259
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:20,010
the borderline between 10x and millennia

260
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:23,770
good for you there we go

261
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:26,980
why if you can actually understand where

262
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:30,370
you're going by understanding where you

263
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:32,340
came from you might have a shot of

264
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:34,630
actually making sense of all this stuff

265
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,470
provide high-level analysis some

266
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,840
multiple source of information

267
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:39,310
intelligence a blend one how are you

268
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,900
positioning your sources how are you

269
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,939
analyzing the information that you're

270
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,220
getting from other peers within the

271
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:47,140
organization how is that helping you

272
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,330
understand where you're standing and

273
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:51,850
where you need to go when the turbine

274
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:56,410
turns off security and security

275
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:59,200
architecture more things we're going to

276
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:01,180
talk about but pretty much this is how

277
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,730
you get started when it comes to

278
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:07,540
understanding what security architecture

279
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:10,060
is this is the one that keeps me awake

280
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:15,550
at night this was this like four days

281
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:17,650
ago later this guy from Chicago he's a

282
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:21,099
very good contributor to the security

283
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:24,760
community came up with this up with this

284
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,600
slide and this is pretty much how much

285
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:30,329
of this is

286
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:33,209
we are security practitioners this is

287
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:35,589
what the estimated damage is going to be

288
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:38,469
and this is how much we're spending to

289
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:40,930
secure stuff and most people are talking

290
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:43,870
about that every single thing people are

291
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:47,729
not willing to put the money in ever in

292
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:51,519
order to get the word we need to be but

293
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:54,790
once again even though we cannot tackle

294
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:57,430
the problem overall we're actually doing

295
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:59,139
our part in evangelizing and all this

296
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,579
stuff within our organization and this

297
00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:04,170
is one thing that we definitely need to

298
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:08,410
keep in mind next please

299
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:10,149
anybody here steer a ball thank you very

300
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:12,939
much G people are connoisseurs

301
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:17,440
so the extensional crisis number one I'm

302
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:19,329
standing god has man I'm in the

303
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,920
crossfire of two different rates of

304
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:23,050
thoughts within the enterprise the

305
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:26,579
business and the technical security

306
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,579
stuff next please

307
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:34,209
so this is what the suits do this is all

308
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:35,740
the air above and the Lord about that

309
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:38,469
it's their job to think to take care of

310
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:41,529
that stuff to worry about the stuff this

311
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:45,430
is what the business here's the sort of

312
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:47,439
investment pulling up time profit prep

313
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:49,380
realization how do I make more money

314
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:52,930
type into a market how can I actually

315
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:55,750
but a market in my in my pocket before

316
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:57,670
somebody gets there how can I innovate

317
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,040
government make my products better how

318
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:02,529
can I get more consumers to buy my stuff

319
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:07,649
or sign up for my services this is the

320
00:14:02,529 --> 00:14:12,490
stuff that the business cares for now

321
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:15,279
nice this what elites do we've all been

322
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:17,529
out there right this is the stuff we

323
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,959
love to do every day but let the play

324
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:21,790
with it we will have to break it there's

325
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:23,099
no there's nothing wrong with that we

326
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,810
love doing this stuff and that's what

327
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,690
over here because we like talk about all

328
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:32,160
the stuff but like I said there's a

329
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:34,740
middle point the next place one more

330
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,079
that's where you are like further we

331
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,270
meet you know cleanse face deny

332
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,850
everything sauce to this is what you

333
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:46,170
want right there you're trying to bridge

334
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:49,200
these two and make them understand what

335
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:52,979
the purpose of the other one is this

336
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:54,270
stuff has impact in all this stuff and

337
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,330
vice versa

338
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:59,760
and you're right here trying to figure

339
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:02,910
out that relationship from an

340
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,439
architectural standpoint that's pretty

341
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:09,689
much what you do every single day an

342
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:12,930
architect was that it had worse into the

343
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:19,440
boy if you're if you're able to walk out

344
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:21,989
of it see see Todd and you sir are gel

345
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:26,190
and pencil think there's no greater

346
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:28,470
thanks very much or Tristan now when I

347
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:30,420
was trying to think about risk but like

348
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:32,820
I said that's the next new tool that we

349
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:35,760
need to start understanding that makes a

350
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:38,490
difference between a solo architect and

351
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:41,960
someone that is let's just say getting

352
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:44,160
there in terms of success next please

353
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,690
you're a big boy now once you sign up

354
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,310
for the architecture job you're a big

355
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,810
boy you're thinking about right now

356
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:50,760
you're thinking about stuff that an

357
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:53,010
analyst doesn't usually think about

358
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:56,340
which is great you're getting into a

359
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:58,200
realm of security you're the first one

360
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:00,840
to go hunt that but because it's an

361
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:03,690
architect it is your job to have a

362
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:05,010
pipeline of work and beetball are going

363
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:07,350
this is pretty much how it works in most

364
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:11,970
organizations people come in with a new

365
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:13,890
project any sort of IT project or it can

366
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:16,710
even be a business project they'll tell

367
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:18,640
you what do you think that we need in

368
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:21,940
terms of security to make this thing

369
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:24,430
happen and you go cool then if you're

370
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:26,080
actually lucky enough to get the data

371
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,760
flow diagram their architectural

372
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,710
diagrams your brain we're gonna start

373
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,020
thinking about all the components of

374
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:34,930
assistant and how security was bolted in

375
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:36,730
there if it was and if it wasn't what's

376
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:40,780
the need to secure every one of those

377
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:42,730
reports that's house didn't get the

378
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,560
intelligence able once again helps you a

379
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,760
lot

380
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,439
where are you positioning your

381
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,780
information sources who are those people

382
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,450
that you talk to in order to understand

383
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:54,939
the project are you actually in that

384
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:57,970
area where the price started we know one

385
00:16:54,940 --> 00:17:00,490
is sold out if you don't have them how

386
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:02,530
are you going to pull them in once you

387
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:04,390
get that information analysis once you

388
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:07,000
get that information how are you to make

389
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:09,959
sense of it what what are you going to

390
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,910
compare it against how are you going to

391
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:16,300
verify its authenticity how do you only

392
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:18,400
how are you going to come up with the

393
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:20,619
little train of thought that makes sense

394
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,300
from the standpoint of what people are

395
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:25,569
trying to do when they propose the

396
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:27,129
solution that's how intelligent cycles

397
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:30,189
can help you then even then you're going

398
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:31,840
to generate information you can get that

399
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:34,000
do people make decisions you're gonna

400
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,370
make you're gonna have to make sure that

401
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,970
those people you feel permission when

402
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:42,520
they're supposed to be using it on time

403
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:44,170
you know how to classify information the

404
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,180
information classification is usually

405
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:47,440
one of the first steps a lot of you

406
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:50,080
start thinking about the level of

407
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,330
security that you need the Google

408
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,550
question of how much money are you gonna

409
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:56,340
spend to secure a ten-dollar about ten

410
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:59,169
dollar bill right

411
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:01,350
if the information that is going through

412
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:04,540
that system or through that initiative

413
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:06,310
is it that important you actually need

414
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:08,860
to ramp up things is it not that

415
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:12,280
important according to whom what are you

416
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:14,110
the owner I'm going to yourself some of

417
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,730
those things are needed in order to

418
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,469
understand how important that

419
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:20,980
information might be what the Teta

420
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:22,570
versus full pay this is a great debate

421
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,230
right now a lot of people are saying

422
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:27,220
that you need to

423
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:30,760
bitch qualitative Northcote quantitative

424
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:32,679
that is not true you might need to

425
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,270
explain things quick and dirty and stuff

426
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:36,250
very very analytical

427
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:38,110
some people would don't give don't give

428
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:40,630
me the numbers just yet tell me where I

429
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:43,120
will get to that right after that which

430
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:44,919
reminds me of an example that I got for

431
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,428
my sister she's actually not my graphic

432
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:47,410
designer

433
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:51,150
and she's also a fashion designer she

434
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:53,740
said that there's one thing about

435
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:56,919
bartman sizes the make them very

436
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:59,020
difficult for people to understand and

437
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:00,760
that is the fact that they are not made

438
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,830
in a tailor-made way they're not

439
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:05,110
tailored to everybody well device does

440
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:06,909
when they turn out like a thousand genes

441
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:10,240
but just let's think about a pair of

442
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:12,970
pants that it's 34 weighs 30 20 if you

443
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,700
don't target and your big favor go sort

444
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:17,320
of fight with those and you try them on

445
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:19,390
some of them are gonna fit and some are

446
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,689
not gonna fit even though they're the

447
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:24,910
same size they're advertising same size

448
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:27,610
why is what they do is in order to

449
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:30,850
accommodate people with the same size

450
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:32,740
with different body types they use X

451
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,780
number of patterns that all look alike

452
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:38,160
but not the same in order to accommodate

453
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:40,570
all that people and sell more genes what

454
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,970
let's say fashion elite conscious people

455
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:45,070
do is they buy the jeans but then they

456
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:47,740
start tailoring well maybe they'll start

457
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:50,439
adapting those those um those garments

458
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,820
do their body because they know they

459
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,910
know what the trick to adapt that

460
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:58,600
garment to their body is wrist models

461
00:19:54,910 --> 00:20:01,540
are swore like the same you get one out

462
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:05,469
of us either could be that it doesn't

463
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:08,230
fit or one can fit close to where you

464
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:10,990
are jeans start tailoring it to they

465
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:12,910
need super easy you start cutting here

466
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:14,830
you start pulling there you start

467
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:16,080
putting in one things that that the

468
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:18,658
other model doesn't have

469
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,970
make it fit the organization but that

470
00:20:18,659 --> 00:20:23,309
it's time you need to get the

471
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:25,380
stakeholders in and understand what the

472
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:29,190
rest posture is in order to see if that

473
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:31,289
model fits you who needs to know about

474
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,539
where's the information going to go it's

475
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:34,860
going to go straight to your boss all

476
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:40,230
the way up to the board it's going to

477
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:41,699
stay within the middle management of

478
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:45,720
your work and the extent to which you

479
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:48,510
can influence the decision maker if if

480
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,960
this information is right if you

481
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:54,450
actually make use of storytelling which

482
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,789
is a great resource you might never be a

483
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:58,919
child influencing something there are

484
00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:00,809
people in an important time that are

485
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:04,169
great at doing is I highly highly

486
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:06,750
recommend that you attend my Theresa

487
00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:08,880
presentation he's a great storyteller if

488
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,980
I know that if I get point at the topic

489
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,500
he can actually make sense of it one

490
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,809
because he knows exactly how to frame

491
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:19,230
that within a storytelling contacts and

492
00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:21,779
who to address that that those two are

493
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:24,240
great assets for anyone who sent tell

494
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:27,750
story about technology and you need to

495
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:30,000
keep that in mind like I said this is

496
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:32,279
not one size fits all solution you need

497
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,950
to figure out how a risk model how an

498
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:39,630
architecture model fits within 32 seats

499
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:41,429
that you're working on nicely if you

500
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:42,480
dispense a bracelet or treat us where do

501
00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:45,870
we go from here

502
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:48,690
where do we go from where we are to

503
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:50,668
where we need to go next please

504
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:53,159
this is where I need you to be very

505
00:21:50,669 --> 00:21:56,360
conscious of less that we're going out

506
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:58,169
there I'll make it very easy for not

507
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:02,729
this amount

508
00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:06,059
last year 2018 these are the 30

509
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:10,260
technologies that are going to change

510
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:13,168
life in the next decade in 2018 bear in

511
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:17,129
mind that this can change by the month

512
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:19,409
right but this is a great point

513
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:21,960
this is a starting point for someone to

514
00:22:19,409 --> 00:22:23,549
understand okay what's the road ahead

515
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:28,110
what do we just

516
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:31,220
thinking about all these low nice shiny

517
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:36,029
beautiful things right

518
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:38,100
AI IOT mobile internet botching

519
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:39,869
maintained an automation robots versus

520
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:42,360
media all technologies cloud computing

521
00:22:39,869 --> 00:22:45,649
3d printing keeps going on and on are

522
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:49,830
not right let me take an example of this

523
00:22:45,649 --> 00:22:53,189
number 2 IOT for years working with IOT

524
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:55,049
projects ICS up one two three four or

525
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,769
five let's thank you very much that's

526
00:22:55,049 --> 00:22:57,418
great

527
00:22:55,769 --> 00:23:00,139
it means that we're definitely seeing

528
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:02,639
this as just saying that's that's true a

529
00:23:00,139 --> 00:23:05,279
lot of people are saying you know what I

530
00:23:02,639 --> 00:23:07,830
just stopped in order to make that a

531
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:10,679
sales count thing better I just saw

532
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:13,379
there's this thing gizmo that can put

533
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:15,779
them in the shelves in in Walmart and we

534
00:23:13,379 --> 00:23:17,100
NASA as a NASA as a supplier I can

535
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:19,169
actually put them in there and track

536
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,488
movement so I know that place people

537
00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:23,039
spend way more time in front of my

538
00:23:20,489 --> 00:23:26,059
product and they're more likely to buy

539
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:29,489
it right and that's an ideal solution

540
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:32,369
awesome it will sell more whatever you

541
00:23:29,489 --> 00:23:36,600
got but one second to let the what point

542
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:38,970
is party less secure them when they sell

543
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,439
that stuff to you they can tell you how

544
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:41,789
much drunk that you're gonna realize it

545
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,499
we're going to tell you how much time

546
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:44,940
you can spend installing it and it'll

547
00:23:43,499 --> 00:23:47,009
tell you what is it that you need to

548
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:49,529
install that thing up in the field what

549
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:54,149
they don't tell you is how you're going

550
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:56,249
to secure it hahaha and what it was not

551
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:58,830
then you're gonna need to start spending

552
00:23:56,249 --> 00:24:01,470
countless nights thinking about this

553
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:04,489
crowd in going and then what am I gonna

554
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:07,710
get like what am I really gonna do this

555
00:24:04,489 --> 00:24:09,779
is when you start putting an

556
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:11,970
architectural framework architecture a

557
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:15,080
reference model into whatever it's

558
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:19,259
thrown at you and you try to figure out

559
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:22,499
what is it that you need to do and it's

560
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:25,499
gonna be an everyday task because like I

561
00:24:22,499 --> 00:24:28,019
said this crap pretty much cream cheese

562
00:24:25,499 --> 00:24:32,159
by the month God knows what's going to

563
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:33,240
be in December or in February 20 - 20 or

564
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,760
whatever

565
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,740
whatever comes in you need to be able to

566
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,710
start thinking about these things from a

567
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:43,649
standpoint of what kind of risk

568
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:46,620
can I see and number two how is that

569
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:51,270
going to affect my business model my

570
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:52,678
organization and there's also a very

571
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:55,889
important thing in here which is how to

572
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:58,350
think about the future right Kristin we

573
00:24:55,890 --> 00:25:01,590
could be some professor at the US Army

574
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:02,789
War College he talks about how think

575
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:04,980
about the future

576
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:07,620
that's it's a great um it's a series of

577
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:10,559
three block both you can actually look

578
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:12,389
him up on on google he writes what like

579
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,340
and stopping this up he some he teaches

580
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:15,840
intelligence analysis and one of his

581
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:18,480
jobs is pretty much start thinking about

582
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,939
the future so when I came across that

583
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,679
piece you start actually starts off by

584
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:25,649
saying you can either think about it

585
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:27,840
when you can worry about it you can be

586
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:30,059
way more pessimistic about it or you can

587
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,678
be worth way more realistic about it if

588
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:33,809
you try to combine a little bit about

589
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,990
the two you actually achieve that little

590
00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:39,330
balance you can actually be able to talk

591
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:41,730
about those things as they come out of

592
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:43,020
the assembly line but you can also start

593
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:44,669
with you what is the first thing that I

594
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:47,668
need to worry about when they hit the

595
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:51,710
shelves and that is exactly where we're

596
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:51,710
going next please

597
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:59,720
thank you very much

598
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:06,390
yes throw that out

599
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:08,160
thank you very much in August most

600
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:10,830
people feel who would uh look where this

601
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:18,030
from and there we go

602
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:20,909
game over pan it's all burn so some of

603
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:22,649
you some of you get to the office in the

604
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:24,360
morning and defer 20 the first thing

605
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:26,940
they do is like throw your problem this

606
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:31,379
is how you read it's all over

607
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:34,560
that's it it's true I feel like that a

608
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:38,400
lot of times but that this is how I feel

609
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:40,169
after why they can't go anywhere pan is

610
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,030
there like in front of you in front of

611
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:44,100
you in the rear the decides they can't

612
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:46,110
go any more for me thank you very much

613
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,449
and this is a great this is a great

614
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:50,909
outlook to have don't be afraid of these

615
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:53,040
things don't be afraid of the new

616
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:55,710
challenges that new technologies are

617
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,840
introducing for the environment for you

618
00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:01,950
shine but that's exactly where you're

619
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,419
going to be doing the superior that's

620
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,850
exactly what you didn't do a superior

621
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:09,030
thing you're gonna have to make money

622
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:11,100
problems you know we start to think

623
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:14,340
about new solutions that no one knows

624
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:15,719
how to secure but at this point you

625
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:18,689
might have been to this in this industry

626
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,520
long enough so that you know how to

627
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:22,650
approach a problem without knowing what

628
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,889
it looks like and that's exactly what

629
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:28,860
I'm trying to give you a little bit of

630
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:31,650
hope in the fact that a lot of things

631
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:33,419
that you've done in your everyday job

632
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,190
it's pretty much was going to help you

633
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:42,000
you know convict Tories when it comes to

634
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:42,990
new technologies okay this slide doesn't

635
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,790
have a single purpose

636
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:49,800
not even related to this presentation

637
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:51,780
but dude I would totally love to kiss up

638
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,790
because this day when my Pig what my

639
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:58,500
days are over

640
00:27:52,790 --> 00:28:01,260
this is great now let's go ahead well I

641
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:03,480
was just I was just talking above it the

642
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:05,610
robot is pretty much try to make trying

643
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,980
to make sense of new technologies that

644
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:10,050
people are trying to harness in order to

645
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:13,440
make the business way more profitable to

646
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:16,680
make it more attractive to make it adapt

647
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:20,540
to to newer consumers and this was the

648
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:23,610
first thing who represent these sneakers

649
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:26,760
thank you thank you very much that would

650
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:30,469
be the Constitution that we come all the

651
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:33,510
way back from like 1993 the fact that

652
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:35,429
information is the most important

653
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:38,309
currency information is the most

654
00:28:35,429 --> 00:28:41,330
important asset back in the day it was

655
00:28:38,309 --> 00:28:47,389
only an afterthought it was only fans

656
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:49,919
right now is the reality data analytics

657
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:52,350
the fact that I know exactly what

658
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:55,200
someone wants the fact that now I can

659
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:58,110
actually autumn over to read people's

660
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,600
minds and pretty much weak people

661
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:02,639
feelings in terms of what do I want what

662
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:06,090
I'm going to do next what do I want to

663
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,400
do what do I crave what I dislike all

664
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:10,470
those things from a commercial business

665
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:13,320
perspective are perfect for me to

666
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:14,100
understand what do I need to do to get

667
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,678
more profits

668
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:18,928
do I need to develop a new product when

669
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:20,460
you select one in person don't need to

670
00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:22,800
solve one of the more graphic is that

671
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:26,040
demographic been different all those

672
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,600
things are massive amounts of data that

673
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,820
we started do need start thinking about

674
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,620
but from a security standpoint what do

675
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:33,990
we that what we need to care are they

676
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:36,149
subject to a regulatory framework all

677
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:38,610
right they sensitive enough so they need

678
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:41,280
to be encrypted then they then they can

679
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:45,149
weaponize that they can be used to done

680
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:48,720
harm all those things start ramping up

681
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:51,150
I'm sorry I'm reading on the empty when

682
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,850
it comes to the stuff that we do in our

683
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:55,159
job that is actually the

684
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:56,539
that's the first part the other one is

685
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:58,940
that we have to deal with massive

686
00:29:56,539 --> 00:30:00,679
amounts of complexity and when we deal

687
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:02,659
with that we start constructing models

688
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:05,210
we do start getting accustomed to

689
00:30:02,659 --> 00:30:06,559
working with stuff we don't know from

690
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:09,139
trying to make guesses from make

691
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,879
educated guesses risk management

692
00:30:09,139 --> 00:30:13,039
discrete for that so as as long as you

693
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,990
start understanding a risk model how it

694
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:17,658
works and how you need to let that into

695
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:19,429
the organization that is going to be way

696
00:30:17,659 --> 00:30:21,500
more easier to work with especially

697
00:30:19,429 --> 00:30:23,450
because there's people that the first

698
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,580
challenge that they have is pretty much

699
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:26,929
figuring out something that they don't

700
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:28,789
know anything about another one of the

701
00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:31,820
first challenges I got thrown in one of

702
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:34,009
my first big you know jobs are we gonna

703
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:35,809
think about extended you don't know

704
00:30:34,009 --> 00:30:40,669
anything about you start constructing up

705
00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:42,678
come on and I think one of the most

706
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:47,029
important ones that I've been thinking

707
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:49,580
about quite when heavily in the in the

708
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:52,399
last couple of months is how are we

709
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:54,678
going to prepare the next generation of

710
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:56,299
superiorities which is a child like I

711
00:30:54,679 --> 00:31:00,549
said it's a job that requires a lot of

712
00:30:56,299 --> 00:31:04,908
refinement in terms of thinking doing in

713
00:31:00,549 --> 00:31:06,440
acting well like I said there are a lot

714
00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:08,629
of you guys that have been out here in

715
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:10,250
this industry for quite a long time I

716
00:31:08,629 --> 00:31:12,439
mean you understand maybe you understand

717
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:14,419
this security from a different

718
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:17,360
standpoint than mine whether that right

719
00:31:14,419 --> 00:31:19,759
next to you that's exactly what you need

720
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,559
in order to be successful in this and

721
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:24,110
form the next generation of architects

722
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:26,149
the fact that it mentor someone to start

723
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:27,889
thinking about things that they don't

724
00:31:26,149 --> 00:31:29,959
know about but they can contribute

725
00:31:27,889 --> 00:31:31,928
because of their review it's because of

726
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:34,340
their experience because of their

727
00:31:31,929 --> 00:31:38,240
demographics or each bracket or whatever

728
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:41,389
it is and in order to make this let me

729
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,490
say an enriching experience you need to

730
00:31:41,389 --> 00:31:46,250
be able to take some under your wing

731
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:49,759
you'd be able to challenge them but you

732
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:51,830
need to be able to make them grow and I

733
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:55,159
can't stand I can try I can't stress

734
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:59,689
that word enough parole if you can't

735
00:31:55,159 --> 00:32:01,910
make that person think in more advanced

736
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:05,420
ways when they're turned that

737
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:07,220
if you can't make that person start

738
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:11,210
getting involved in late horn things

739
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:12,740
you're really grasping the flavor or the

740
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:14,540
essence of all this stuff that we're

741
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,280
going we're failing on that and I think

742
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,750
we've got we had very good people in

743
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,340
here doing that kind of stuff I've

744
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:20,630
actually had an opportunity to interact

745
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:24,199
with a lot of people that are in the

746
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:26,510
mentorship position or in in a

747
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:31,370
four-minute position they're doing a

748
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:33,800
great job believe morally and as long as

749
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:36,770
we keep that exchange of information the

750
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:39,169
we keep our ears open and we keep that

751
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:40,550
general openness in getting more people

752
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:42,590
in here from different backgrounds from

753
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:43,940
different walks of life or to help us

754
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:46,520
understand things that we don't

755
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:48,980
understand that's the only way that

756
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:53,450
we're going to make it out alive out of

757
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:58,240
this this game okay thank you very much

758
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:58,240
that's about it any questions yes sir

759
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:51,609
that's a great question so my answer to

760
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:56,949
that would be that's reason we need a

761
00:33:51,609 --> 00:33:58,960
restaurant by by assessing the need let

762
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:00,190
me rephrase you said it's a necklace and

763
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,869
exponential thing

764
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:03,789
it wasn't something it's an exponential

765
00:34:01,869 --> 00:34:07,379
value that has to do with money that you

766
00:34:03,789 --> 00:34:09,909
spend in security things and how much

767
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:13,509
how much danger is gonna come your way

768
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:14,859
did I say that right excellent the way I

769
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:17,109
would do it the way that would approach

770
00:34:14,859 --> 00:34:19,389
it is that responding to understand the

771
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:22,119
restaurant because if you understand the

772
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:23,950
risk you understand how much money you

773
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:28,659
actually need to put into that wrestler

774
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:32,408
too many in that now is let me go back

775
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:34,569
to the one size fits all another that's

776
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:40,210
a reason why you mean a lot of think

777
00:34:34,569 --> 00:34:42,639
about the night was fear you need you

778
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:44,740
need to get a lot of samples in order to

779
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,379
make something accurate that's that's

780
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:49,589
hardly know

781
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:50,159
and in the ball in the ball breaker the

782
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:52,049
morning

783
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,489
sadly the more sample so information

784
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:55,739
that we have about a single event the

785
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:57,720
more actually they'll understand how it

786
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:59,579
is so in order to get in order to

787
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,019
understand what risk first of all you

788
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:06,869
need to get a lot of information about

789
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:08,640
that risk a number two you need to reach

790
00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:10,799
it but you need to reach a common ground

791
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,440
we need to meet in the middle what the

792
00:35:10,799 --> 00:35:15,299
person that brought that risk of because

793
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,519
you're going to have one perception of

794
00:35:15,299 --> 00:35:18,749
that risk the person who put it on your

795
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:21,629
table is gonna have another perception

796
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:23,399
of others maybe he thinks you need to

797
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:25,349
spend way more money in order to to get

798
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:28,170
that was now maybe you think the other

799
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:30,660
way around so maybe if you can actually

800
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:34,009
get to a common ground to understand

801
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:37,799
that risk that is how a you're going to

802
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:41,509
come up with a solid risk bust even in

803
00:35:37,799 --> 00:35:44,759
number two you're going to come up with

804
00:35:41,509 --> 00:35:46,710
the right amount of money to get to that

805
00:35:44,759 --> 00:35:49,019
point to get to the tipping point where

806
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:52,589
you're you're at the optimal level of

807
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:53,160
money spent and risk reduced does that

808
00:35:52,589 --> 00:35:59,219
answer the question

809
00:35:53,160 --> 00:36:01,140
venture anybody else no awesome well I

810
00:35:59,219 --> 00:36:03,239
said four or five five thank you very

811
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,348
much and I hope you keep having a great

812
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:06,070
great conference thank you all for

813
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:12,889
showing up

814
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:12,889
[Applause]
