1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,529
so basically you know in terms of

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,810
audience I'm not going to deep dive in

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:08,280
power as a four-set the CTO with you

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,730
that's typically though they already

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,190
have those pretty much figure it out but

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:17,730
it's getting different opinions on the

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,410
resume especially from hiring if you

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,900
have a colleague that you met at a

9
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,500
networking event for them to review your

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,349
resume

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,320
that's great insight and you are as much

12
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,810
as you decide to Bucknam so yeah it's

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,070
it's it's really really interesting and

14
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,390
everybody's path is very different and

15
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:39,660
reinventing your career or switching

16
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:42,270
really paths when you're interested in

17
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,099
to getting into cybersecurity but you

18
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,710
you don't know how to really compile

19
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,469
everything if you have worked on risk

20
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,510
project is you want that something on

21
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:55,410
your resume or oh it's really you know

22
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:58,230
it's an interesting path because your

23
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,419
resume is your professional DNA yeah so

24
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,849
it's it's a guy just want to be like

25
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,080
this first thing that you you just take

26
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,270
what you have in this removing

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,298
experience and then dishes you know

28
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,310
that's how this is for me but it can be

29
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,710
daunting and one of the things that I

30
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,750
share I have not a resume right now but

31
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:19,360
I know the resumes that get you in the

32
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:22,750
door and I hired

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,270
and ask for different things right honey

34
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:28,810
you know it is for me interesting so how

35
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:30,759
many kids did you bring to therapist so

36
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:32,590
I think the last year there were

37
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,210
slightly over 100 and I think this year

38
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,790
it was just under a hundred so they went

39
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:39,789
down a little bit but and I don't know

40
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:42,190
the breakdown of various schools know

41
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:45,729
some of them you know like damp or less

42
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:47,649
is very very big on robotics and

43
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:49,900
computer science they've got a very

44
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:52,390
strong program within that school or

45
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:54,009
multiple strong programs I don't know

46
00:01:52,390 --> 00:02:01,240
which of the other ones do or do not

47
00:01:54,009 --> 00:02:04,560
sell as I think the schools in Iowa aid

48
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:07,929
that has a social security the track

49
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,050
team at Community College that's kind of

50
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:15,310
a freshman maybe of two years ago so we

51
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:18,100
have really those amazing tracks I think

52
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:20,650
the challenge for employers they always

53
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,540
want to see outside their company when

54
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:25,989
you may have someone who works in a call

55
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:30,130
center that can detect or is doing a

56
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:32,590
issue log and those are just discipline

57
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:34,390
or a method of thinking that you need to

58
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,580
currently and your biggest asset are

59
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:39,518
going to come from inside the door too

60
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:44,170
so for someone who is working for a

61
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:47,650
healthcare company or or a mortgage

62
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:50,869
company it's really fine-tuning again so

63
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:54,910
that you can switch carrier path okay

64
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,910
but still have a couple minutes I'm just

65
00:02:55,629 --> 00:03:02,649
my hands are frozen and I'm dreaming

66
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:04,970
merry cold water so it's going here yes

67
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,709
last year I was a little cold so I

68
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:10,340
bought my jacket I didn't bring a

69
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:13,730
blanket or like your fur it's not quite

70
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:21,140
there an amazing weather and it's just

71
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:24,470
been amazing so actually since last year

72
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:28,940
so I incorporated my company last year

73
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:31,220
on November 11th on Veterans Day so it's

74
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,470
really interesting on how this is linked

75
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:35,359
and I'll share that in my presentation -

76
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:37,280
coin coin coin kana

77
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:42,799
master was a pivotal moment for my

78
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:44,810
career it's it's it's really interesting

79
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,930
you never know I'll try Australia

80
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:51,700
important to the other community your

81
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:55,340
network is really part of your capital

82
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:59,018
and those insights you know they're

83
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,019
going to encourage you to push yourself

84
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:06,710
[Music]

85
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:08,750
you got your own presentation Friday so

86
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:17,510
do they do it you'll present next year

87
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:25,030

88
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:28,580
people down south we have someone

89
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:30,650
presenting at secure Iowa or Zevon as

90
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:34,609
Tuesday October 8th and didn't wait I

91
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:36,260
think Jeff he's going there are because

92
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:49,810
I know one of our guys is going to an

93
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:49,810
event over that way well that's another

94
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:56,540
thank you - yeah it's a free conference

95
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:59,110
there's a track where you have to pay

96
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:02,780
that it just draws from a citizen

97
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:04,850
basically food in the free part if it's

98
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,349
what I think it is then the guy I was

99
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:09,370
talking to was also our office to

100
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:09,370
decipher he was

101
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:19,629
and it's amazing I do in cycling I mean

102
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:22,120
literally last year arts security user

103
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:25,780
group and then that's how I guess who

104
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,909
have a point on and just like one thing

105
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:32,318
to another I'm driving from Des Moines

106
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:33,819
is just so easy it just doesn't take too

107
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:41,620
much time anything out it's not saying

108
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:44,500
it I would stuff in Iowa City so I see

109
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,599
the thing is I really like corn so I

110
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:50,139
know you can get a farm like where the

111
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:53,050
the sky meets the field and I love

112
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:56,199
seeing those little squares of farms I

113
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:57,190
ghost was brighter I point it so really

114
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:08,919
people do yoga

115
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:11,590
I don't driving in a peaceful state did

116
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:13,539
you have to drive okay no no I live

117
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:15,969
right around here just period I just ate

118
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:17,560
anymore you know I used to love like

119
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:19,960
driving I was like that I mean I would

120
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:23,020
just drive for hours with just no no

121
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,120
problems but you know anymore it's just

122
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,440
there's so many distracted drivers out

123
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,719
there not paying attention to what's

124
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,719
going on I tend to find them

125
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:39,630
yeah I just me and driving don't get

126
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:42,810
along anymore I I don't know if I had to

127
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:52,080
drive for living some quite a bit in

128
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:54,110
this job it's almost free am just going

129
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:59,510
to give it maybe two more minutes just

130
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:59,510
to be to be fair so I don't give anybody

131
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:20,700
so you guys going to the party after

132
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:24,440
days yeah it's on the other side of the

133
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,440
river it's only like 10 or 15 minutes

134
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:31,859
how did they decide we wanted to leave

135
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:39,470
this is the one the wonderful leaves

136
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:43,710
quite a bit important last year right no

137
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:54,450
they did the it was an escape room

138
00:07:43,710 --> 00:08:02,159
experience oh okay the escape did you

139
00:07:54,450 --> 00:08:04,500
guys make it but we did have like twelve

140
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,510
year older they showed with us that was

141
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,430
at the right height to find clues that

142
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,930
cuz we're all tall and so it's nice to

143
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,910
have a short personal looking for clues

144
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:14,600
to because we would never found those

145
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,600
without that

146
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:33,460
although some people don't really

147
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,100
leverage that as yeah I can see where

148
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,630
that we could go or what horribly wrong

149
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:46,630
and you're like very happy you're not

150
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:48,790
all stranded on an island all right but

151
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:50,980
you don't just get started and let's see

152
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:53,319
a blue trickles in well thank you so

153
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,400
much you guys who made it it's the end

154
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,890
of the day

155
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,800
yay I'm taking you from drinking in

156
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:03,220
about like 45 and now we're in ten

157
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:05,469
minutes right okay so um today I'm just

158
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:09,820
going to go over some very very basic

159
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:11,320
lessons that I got from recruiting share

160
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:14,410
a little bit about my background so you

161
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:18,070
kind of understand my itinerary in some

162
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:21,040
ways to the IT world and then I'll go

163
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:22,840
over some of the resumes and how to

164
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:27,610
apply those to you so it's really really

165
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:30,750

166
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:34,840

167
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:38,350

168
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:42,370
vendors I mean I'm really these events

169
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:45,670
it's so wonderful when people help and

170
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:49,330
come together I also want to thank my

171
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:52,390
investor and if you were at Cork on last

172
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:56,200
year dr. Richard HL Marshall who's

173
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:59,140
considered the first legal architect for

174
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:02,780
the first cyber warfare in the u.s.

175
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:06,230
scenario is actually a friend

176
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:07,970
in a wheat field and that's really

177
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,680
because I've been happy here so I think

178
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:13,010
you know thank you for everyone for

179
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,750
being encouraging and one of the quotes

180
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:16,100
that I really like is the secret to

181
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:19,550
having it all is knowing you're all

182
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:22,970
ready to sow gratefulness and thank you

183
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:25,339
both a long way so before becoming the

184
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:27,200
CEO of who each field partners because

185
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:30,290
we get to that point in our career where

186
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,200
we have a little fishel big title you

187
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:35,719
know that was just me that was if you

188
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,860
had asked me at that age what I wanted

189
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:42,380
to be I wanted to drive a tractor and

190
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:44,540
the outside all the time I also wanted

191
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:48,740
to be a doctor and I wanted to be a war

192
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:51,709
reporter really really drastic so a

193
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:54,800
little bit about my background I grew up

194
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:58,160
on a farm in France very rural it was a

195
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:01,250
hamlet to get milk you had to drive like

196
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:05,930
literally 15 minutes wait there was a

197
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:10,460
pond and I moved my farm was surrounded

198
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:15,349
by wheat fields and corn and so I really

199
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:21,200
will furl a lifestyle I moved to the

200
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:23,120
u.s. in basically - I was 16 I graduated

201
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,660
from high school in San Luis Missouri

202
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,360
Marin's Hall and then I got a

203
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,699
scholarship to Drake University and

204
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,770
that's what brought me to Des Moines and

205
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:38,630
you know the key to go back again about

206
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:41,360
agriculture and Iowa cornfield corn is

207
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:45,070
really a good symbol but to me is when I

208
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:48,200
had a scholarship at DePaul in Indiana

209
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:51,080
tobacco tobacco Laster and another one

210
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,030
that deriving from some Louis Missouri

211
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:57,290
to Des Moines Iowa

212
00:11:53,030 --> 00:12:00,800
I saw those rows of coins and this could

213
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:03,380
be home you know the tipping point from

214
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,099
you know being in school at Drake

215
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,089
University

216
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,829
it was

217
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:09,019
really when I got contacted by a

218
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:11,229
recruiter and Killeen Moline you

219
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:14,809
probably have heard of a Ileana vation a

220
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:17,600
small company they needed to purchase a

221
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:19,339
couple plays small planes and they were

222
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,620
looking for someone who spoke French in

223
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:25,009
Des Moines in the nineties and they

224
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,870
found me so it was like oh I'm going to

225
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:28,999
have to dress up for this assignment and

226
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:31,490
I didn't have a car so the recruiter had

227
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:33,829
to pick me up from Drake and and Here I

228
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:37,129
am with the big shots and little planes

229
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:39,498
are taking off I'm a little bit more

230
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:42,430
about my background consulting

231
00:12:39,499 --> 00:12:45,980
engagements of from one little gay

232
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:49,128
translating and airplane knobs I got to

233
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:52,189
do more recruiting recruiting consulting

234
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:55,309
engagements so it would be pulled in to

235
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:57,019
just fill in for someone who was you

236
00:12:55,309 --> 00:13:00,350
know on a prank

237
00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:03,319
an eternity Eve or someone who had just

238
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:05,480
quit so I would be required to jumping

239
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:07,719
in different environments and for me

240
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,639
compared to all my friends who were like

241
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:13,339
don't want something stable stable job I

242
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:16,220
was like no I want to learn so I got to

243
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:18,410
work for tones brothers how many of you

244
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:21,800
have heard of tones brothers in Ankeny

245
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:24,410
okay manufacturing spices if you've

246
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:27,349
heard of a Spice Islands order Keo

247
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:30,649
French they were acquired by a CH whose

248
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:31,740
and I work there with the marketing

249
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:34,230
department and

250
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,970
Manufacturing planet while they were the

251
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:38,430
you acquired so you learn about

252
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:40,020
different softwares you get exposed to

253
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:42,209
different projects and people and you

254
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:45,270
are building your network so I've done

255
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:47,310
consulting agent engagements I've worked

256
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:50,370
as a permanent employee in about 15

257
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:53,099
years of experience and what I have

258
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:55,530
learned is really to craft your resume

259
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:58,320
to attract really the right

260
00:13:55,530 --> 00:14:02,100
opportunities and project so your resume

261
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,380
it's essential that you write down all

262
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,790
the details of the experiment really are

263
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,560
going to have projects that are

264
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:10,260
confidential you won't be able to list

265
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:12,689
that but you can list the breadth of

266
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:14,040
impact of your work and that's how

267
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,720
you're going to be measured in the

268
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:19,160
interview but also through the piece of

269
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:22,490
pain another key that I found in during

270
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,780
consulting engagements volunteer

271
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:27,080
volunteering can give you a great

272
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:29,970
opportunity to get into a startup or

273
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:33,060
maybe a nonprofit organization and make

274
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:35,550
a contribution where you can decide what

275
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:38,219
you're going to work on it's great

276
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:40,650
experience it's also great because when

277
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,690
you're going to get interviewed for a

278
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,709
job and they ask you well what are you

279
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,780
doing right now

280
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:48,060
well I'm volunteering on this projects

281
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:50,339
and this is what my date today looks

282
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:53,819
like and I love helping people so you

283
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:55,860
need to you know grow your resume grow

284
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,920
your experiencing different venture but

285
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:01,290
volunteer when you're unemployed or a

286
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,670
transition is really important building

287
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:05,130
your Oracle references

288
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:08,219
to back up your professionalism and

289
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:10,740
expertise so being able to have a

290
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:13,610
reference to a volunteer project about

291
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,910
how you handle a critical project

292
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,400
validates

293
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:18,870
for the references and the interview so

294
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,569
you can say what this person can really

295
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:26,180
a test of my

296
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:32,720
experience so really an unlikely path

297
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:37,319
that me today 2018 corn come here was a

298
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:39,690
complete change of my life actually to

299
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:43,680
give you a little bit of background in

300
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:45,720
2013 it was sourced by a company in Des

301
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,989
Moines called Midwest project partners

302
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:51,930
and they were a boutique consulting firm

303
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:54,330
they have consultants 15 plus years of

304
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,870
experience 10 year on the consultants 8

305
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:57,180
years

306
00:15:54,870 --> 00:16:00,600
very very seasoned professional and I

307
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:03,319
was professionals and I was hired to be

308
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:06,930
basically be the recruiting manager for

309
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:09,900
mid-level IT roles but also there were

310
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:12,989
sea levels as well and it was not just

311
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:16,050
one pipeline not just project managers

312
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:20,130
it could be a CTO it could be business

313
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:22,199
analysts QA tester so what I had to do

314
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:25,890
from scratch because I was really

315
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:29,070
getting to be the IT arm of the company

316
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:32,400
and help funnel those candidates I had

317
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:34,740
to build my network and building again

318
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:39,569
the word network building your network

319
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:41,820
you have to attend those user groups and

320
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:43,320
gain the trust I mean people are not

321
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,990
going to just give you their massive and

322
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,430
personal information without knowing

323
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:49,740
that you're going to take care of them

324
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:52,380
so I'm working for this consulting

325
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,690
company and I'm just really loving it

326
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:57,090
and I'm thinking you know I need to

327
00:16:54,690 --> 00:17:02,250
retire from there and my boss who was

328
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:04,949
the VP of technical partners the ITR was

329
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,900
also thinking you know we're all going

330
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:08,800
to retire from this company but the

331
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:12,900
partners had to

332
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:18,339
and us selling the company and so in

333
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:20,650
2016 I have to say I was a transition

334
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:23,169
into a new role and it just was not

335
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:26,110
quite feeling it and I did something

336
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:29,470
that I would definitely advise no one to

337
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:31,300
do is I actually quit the role that I

338
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:34,900
was in and I I didn't have a specific

339
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:37,930
back-up plan at a time I did a three

340
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:43,150
sixteen in my career I actually worked

341
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:46,000
in the direct sales fashion jewelry

342
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:48,880
completely different and then last year

343
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,040
in July I got offered a job to go into

344
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:55,380
IT recruiting again it was like great

345
00:17:51,040 --> 00:18:01,030
I'm going to do serious stuff again yes

346
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:02,800
and I'm turning sec TSM RIT user who in

347
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:05,879
Des Moines and then I heard about

348
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:09,639
Qualcomm and came to Kolkata and

349
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,860
literally three months later about a

350
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,490
week after I had attended Cornell I was

351
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:19,090
let go

352
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:25,210
lost my job and my suddenly my world

353
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:27,580
was it was very very hard and I I was

354
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,900
really struggling at that time and I was

355
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,870
thinking what am I going to do

356
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:34,000
okay well go back to your network you

357
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:35,290
use a group beat up there because you

358
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,570
need to be around people that are

359
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:40,480
working on projects so I really got

360
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:44,439
involved again with SEC DSM and actually

361
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:47,190
invited one of our speakers rich and

362
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:50,650
Marshall to speak at SEC DSM and

363
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:51,940
basically he said to me you know Kennedy

364
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:56,590
you've got a greeting that or why don't

365
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:58,420
you build your own company and you have

366
00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:02,409
to believe in yourself some people can

367
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:04,810
see like the the the the you can't see a

368
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:07,600
bright future in you but you have to see

369
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:09,490
it in yourself and say you know

370
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,520
if you believed in yourself as much as I

371
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:15,730
do I low invested in getting new started

372
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:18,490
and so that's what happened last year

373
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:23,530
November 11th 2018

374
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:26,530
I was incorporated and this year I'm

375
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:36,850
launching my company so you see a little

376
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:37,450
press it was a growing pain I get it all

377
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,429
right

378
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:41,410
so every day you reinvent yourself

379
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:44,890
you're always in motion but you decide

380
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:46,720
every day forward or backward each of us

381
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:49,090
has the unique ability to bounce back

382
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,070
and create the future we desire we just

383
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:54,189
need to master our stories and project

384
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:55,929
experience and share it accurately your

385
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:57,460
resume is just like you constantly

386
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:59,110
evolving the best way to get the right

387
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,840
resume is to seek feedback from their

388
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:03,850
network school mentor Spears resume

389
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,199
writing is a skill but know you can

390
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:08,110
always hire someone

391
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:12,340
so the ranchers I'm using the ROI is a

392
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:14,500
150 to 350 but it's really valuable to

393
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:17,199
you know you can do plumbing in your

394
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,730
house on your own but sometimes also

395
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,370
saying it can be a really good choice

396
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:23,070
too you are in control of your destiny

397
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:25,929
choose the right words

398
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:27,510
so today skinful we're going to assess

399
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:30,670
where you are anywhere you want to be

400
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:33,010
for scenarios to choose from we're going

401
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:34,780
to do a basic overview of resume

402
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:38,830
structures whether it's entry-level

403
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:41,050
mid-level or executive and really

404
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:42,340
getting the right resumes structure is

405
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:44,080
going to give you the salary the

406
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:46,810
compensation that your experience

407
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:50,919
command I need a lot of candidates and

408
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:53,708
for a new opportunities that I don't

409
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:56,299
have to get that much

410
00:20:53,709 --> 00:20:57,859
you always want to grow because if

411
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:59,749
you're taking on more responsibilities

412
00:20:57,859 --> 00:21:02,569
you should be paid accordingly and

413
00:20:59,749 --> 00:21:04,759
employers understand that so I won't get

414
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:07,309
today into negotiation but that's a

415
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:09,319
pretty critical factor so let's do this

416
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:11,418
so assess where you are and where you

417
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:13,399
want to be so scenario currently

418
00:21:11,419 --> 00:21:15,709
employed but you're looking for a more

419
00:21:13,399 --> 00:21:16,908
challenging role currently appointment

420
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:19,639
need to move into a new environment

421
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:21,319
which is very different yeah sense of

422
00:21:19,639 --> 00:21:24,438
agency maybe here at the spot where the

423
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:27,529
future is not a fit not improbably about

424
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:29,389
looking to get hired as soon as possible

425
00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:32,599
currently a student there looking to get

426
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:34,458
a part-time job or an internship okay

427
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:37,158
currently I'm quite about looking for a

428
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:40,009
more challenging role so really one of

429
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:41,869
the things that I always encourage some

430
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:43,909
people work on their resume that they

431
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:47,299
may not have a specific job I just need

432
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:49,219
a job if you have to look at the exact

433
00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:52,639
description of your current job so what

434
00:21:49,219 --> 00:21:56,419
I would say in your current job go on in

435
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:59,478
deed or zip recruiter or on LinkedIn and

436
00:21:56,419 --> 00:22:01,699
look at jobs out there that are similar

437
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:03,379
to what you're currently doing because

438
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:06,019
maybe you won't recall that you're doing

439
00:22:03,379 --> 00:22:07,698
this day today but that template is also

440
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:11,269
something that you can use for building

441
00:22:07,699 --> 00:22:13,399
ponies so really there are resources out

442
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:15,109
there because sometimes alone I know

443
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:19,518
what I can do but I don't know how to

444
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:22,728
phrase it so also a critical factor is

445
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:25,309
if you are a backup for your manager

446
00:22:22,729 --> 00:22:27,559
make sure you list that because it shows

447
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:29,479
you have additional trust and

448
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:30,000
responsibilities within your team and I

449
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:32,400
am

450
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,320
your business unit people overlook that

451
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,060
statement but that could mean that could

452
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,280
affect your compensation and how you

453
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:41,190
looked at home during the interview so

454
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:46,290
your trusted to take on the work if your

455
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:48,060
boss is not not not available the next

456
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:50,310
step really compiled the details of the

457
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:53,360
projects you worked on this is a crucial

458
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:55,620
element it's amazing because again we

459
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,439
sometimes we don't list everything that

460
00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:00,810
we've worked on that the projects and

461
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:03,090
the details and the impact is really

462
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:06,090
really a problem so any purpose of the

463
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:08,639
project the audience the impact the

464
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:10,860
budget especially if you manage it how

465
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,080
many consultants or FTAs full-time

466
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:15,479
employees were allocated so you can all

467
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:19,350
shows really you know is this under 1

468
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,850
million is it about 2 million by looking

469
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:22,889
over the job description or make sure to

470
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:24,300
make sure your resume included the

471
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,560
project proof that you have already

472
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:29,730
accomplished what they are looking for

473
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:31,710
so in the JD the job description so that

474
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,450
for the job that you're applying when

475
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:36,780
you look at the responsibilities of that

476
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:38,160
job make sure that you highlight and

477
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:40,980
you're like ok I've done this I've done

478
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,140
this and then you can write your

479
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:46,590
experience next to it so for me I mean I

480
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:49,500
crafted a resume based again on the job

481
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:51,030
experience so and then those will be

482
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,750
great example for you to prepare for

483
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:58,980
your phone screen and interview or your

484
00:23:54,750 --> 00:24:00,540
in person interview scenario maybe

485
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,640
you're currently employed but need to

486
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:04,320
move into a new environment I have been

487
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,970
there I hear you sometimes we find

488
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,770
ourselves in the wrong culture a lateral

489
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:10,620
move moving into a similar role with

490
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:12,300
simple same responsibilities so the next

491
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:15,179
steps I would say is look at your

492
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:19,310
non-compete if you have one because an

493
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:23,970
easier way to apply for a different job

494
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:28,350
the different job in a in a competitor

495
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:31,530
so for example if you work in I'm not

496
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:34,199
going to list it but you want to look at

497
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:36,810
other competitors of that company

498
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,760
because they will know exactly and you

499
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:41,250
you can say I've had 8 years of

500
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:43,379
experience and within that industry and

501
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:46,200
companies really look if you have an

502
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:48,210
industry experience too when they look

503
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,520
at multiple candidates so if someone has

504
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:53,660
a healthcare background that someone has

505
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:56,010
the same qualification that came from

506
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:58,890
manufacturing thus they are less likely

507
00:24:56,010 --> 00:25:01,110
to be looked upon by a recruiter again

508
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:03,030
compile the details of the projects I

509
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:05,639
went over that you look at the job

510
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:09,629
description make sure to include the

511
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:13,410
project proof see not employed looking

512
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:15,150
to get hired as soon as possible so I

513
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:17,040
don't know how many of you in this room

514
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:20,760
that that applies to but if you've been

515
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:24,389
out of the market for a year or more and

516
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:27,080
had to leave for personal reasons really

517
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:29,550
trying to get back into a corporate job

518
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,679
trying to get a new job I would look at

519
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:35,010
the the job that you had maybe a year

520
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:37,710
prior and look at similar jobs that are

521
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:39,150
out there if you try to do something

522
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:42,240
that's a completely different

523
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:46,170
opportunity it's going to be very hard

524
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:48,240
to get in the door and sometimes you

525
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:51,870
know consulting also can be the fastest

526
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,370
way to get back into the field so even

527
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:55,739
though for example over there if you're

528
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:57,780
looking for part if if you're looking

529
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:00,020
for a full-time role and you haven't

530
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:02,340
been employed for a while maybe a

531
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:05,340
consulting role that may not be your

532
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:07,139
high pay rate can get you into the door

533
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:09,149
in the right employer so when you've

534
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:12,270
been out of the back of the bench you're

535
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:14,580
competing with still other people but in

536
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:18,330
the consulting role you get back into

537
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:20,340
their game the other alternative nASA

538
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:24,629
has customer service or call center

539
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:26,000
again get into the door currently a

540
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:28,010
student when looking to get

541
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,930
let's enter shift or normal in school

542
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:33,470
you have education that means hands-on

543
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:36,740
experience again list your current and

544
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:39,170
past project with a lot of details if

545
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:41,000
your entry I'm sorry

546
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:43,130
make sure to list all the technical

547
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,350
skills so all the software's or the

548
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:48,470
systems that you're using expo makes

549
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:51,139
sure to list them have references so

550
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:53,960
when your volunteer working on other

551
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:55,820
projects get involved in IT user group

552
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,590
build your own community attend

553
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:59,240
conferences and they valence bond to

554
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:02,990
your volunteer build relationships to

555
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:05,750
them your next job so we're going to go

556
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:08,780
over three basic resume structure

557
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:10,160
entry-level mid-level exactly not so

558
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,200
much because when you get as I feel at

559
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:15,290
home to me

560
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:19,490
now it's not people harass me so before

561
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:21,830
we look at this three type you need to

562
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:24,920
know which which role you are currently

563
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:26,600
in and where you are trying to be I've

564
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,340
done this sub job description in front

565
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,020
of you before you start writing in so

566
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:31,959
basically you're going to print out

567
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:34,910
those jobs that you're looking at and

568
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,250
just really look at the distinction and

569
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:39,680
even the wording so that you can replay

570
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:42,740
it or merit in your resume so when the

571
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:46,340
employer is looking at it okay I can see

572
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:49,040
and the other thing that I would say

573
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:51,530
that I know that you know the role that

574
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:53,510
you're applying for where you are can be

575
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:57,220
very different if you decide to go into

576
00:27:53,510 --> 00:28:01,220
startups startups are a great way to

577
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:03,770
expand your skills and go into a near

578
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:05,960
also that that's that's really something

579
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:07,430
that I would encourage if you're

580
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,160
interested in those

581
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:11,990
so entry-level I mean at this these are

582
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,510
just basic descriptions I'll just let

583
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:17,990
you read them but these are the

584
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:21,500
descriptions you know three years of

585
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:23,110
experience more entry-level mid-career

586
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:26,570
that can be

587
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:29,299
different but it's above entry level but

588
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:32,200
some people can have you know five to

589
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:34,700
eight years and that and then see our

590
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,710
executive that can be several years ten

591
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,419
plus years fifteen years it's really the

592
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:42,280
level of responsibilities that you take

593
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:45,409
on okay basic tip resonate so spelling

594
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:48,799
spelling silly every recruiter would

595
00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:51,799
tell you that the accurate simplicity is

596
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:54,980
keep clarity so one thing when it comes

597
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:57,710
to font the reason you want a very

598
00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:00,200
simple thought is when your resume gets

599
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:02,240
scanned and you're submitting it on the

600
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:05,169
company website or even providing it to

601
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,429
arrest to a to a weaker recruiter

602
00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:09,409
sometimes with certain fonts it will

603
00:29:07,429 --> 00:29:11,960
modify them and then it will create

604
00:29:09,409 --> 00:29:15,440
symbols and then it's just not going to

605
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:19,460
look quite right so I would say make

606
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,570
sure your font is easy to read accuracy

607
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:24,169
so clearly don't forget your

608
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:27,649
certifications you've paid for them list

609
00:29:24,169 --> 00:29:29,360
metrics so really in terms of impact

610
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:32,870
what you've been able to see them the

611
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:35,299
company or your efforts impacting

612
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:37,010
dollars this standard you know I've

613
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:39,320
gotten back and forth in consulting it's

614
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:41,090
going to be a lot more about two-page

615
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:44,539
resume would be kind of the standard

616
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:49,789
that I see clearly it you know don't use

617
00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:52,070
a font that site size forty resume must

618
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:54,530
have cynically basic first name last

619
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:58,580
name phone number email professional

620
00:29:54,530 --> 00:30:00,860
email that is so big drip at hotmail is

621
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:03,139
not going to work when you're you know

622
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:05,510
submitting your resume just don't do it

623
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:07,970
just don't do it create a new email and

624
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:11,150
then your LinkedIn profile name that's

625
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:14,179
really important to have everybody's

626
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:17,090
looking on LinkedIn and recruiters are

627
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:20,390
going to just click on in

628
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:22,490
so being able to in in cybersecurity

629
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:24,320
clearly there are some details on the

630
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:26,720
Intendant you probably want to avoid

631
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,460
having out there but LinkedIn for not

632
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,330
every recruiter is things with a fine

633
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:35,810
prospect bass resume needs to be telling

634
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:37,909
to the job you're applying for print job

635
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:41,090
description but you know sometimes I

636
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:44,390
would apply for different really types

637
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:47,060
of jobs and took a full-time job or

638
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:48,860
consulting role I'm going to dive a lot

639
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:51,320
more in the projects for consulting role

640
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:59,389
in the industry and and the immersion

641
00:30:51,320 --> 00:31:04,960
that I have so I have a question about

642
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:09,440
number two so one of the one of the

643
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:13,580
confusing things that I have noticed for

644
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:17,810
people about people's resumes is that

645
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:20,510
they think they have to put every job on

646
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:24,500
the resume so they do a chronological

647
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:27,560
resume rather than a resume focus on the

648
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:31,180
particular job so from the recruiter

649
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:36,620
perspective right I know you're stating

650
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:39,410
to me tailor your resume to the job but

651
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:44,000
how does someone go about doing that

652
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:48,170
when they really don't understand yeah

653
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,600
yeah you know what I speak did finding

654
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:52,370
where you want to be and where you want

655
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,919
to go that's why I always say have the

656
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:57,050
person not just view it online and have

657
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,720
my screen and write work on their resume

658
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:02,210
but print where you are and where you

659
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,530
want to be so really you can see the

660
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:05,330
level and the differences in

661
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:06,350
responsibilities those levels are

662
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:09,260
critical to believe

663
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:13,580
or for your compensation am i answering

664
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:16,370
the question you are - and I'm really

665
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:18,980
searching for if I'm right in how I

666
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:22,219
coach people and one of the things I do

667
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:24,770
say is to tailor the job

668
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:30,049
yeah right tell your resume to the job

669
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:34,280
it doesn't mean make stuff up but you

670
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:39,280
you tailor it either to job to the job

671
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:41,210
and your experience or to job and

672
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,908
education if you don't have it

673
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:46,659
yeah experience that you have the

674
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:49,669
education and I just want to make sure

675
00:32:46,659 --> 00:32:51,710
that was right yeah it's it's really I

676
00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:56,120
mean it's interesting because people

677
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:57,740
find that the and I do - writing your

678
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,780
own resume like it's almost maddening

679
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:01,669
like oh my gosh so then thing and I have

680
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:04,039
to submit this right away because it's

681
00:33:01,669 --> 00:33:05,450
that a fraction of like do I recall

682
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:07,850
everything that I've done that by

683
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,320
looking at other job choice I go I'm

684
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:11,629
just going to take it something super

685
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,700
basic like call center but like I've

686
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:15,200
worked in a call center and I was

687
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:18,950
updating my resume and a couple years

688
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,690
ago 10 years ago and I couldn't recall

689
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:24,340
the date today there were some other

690
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:27,289
systems that I was using and I looked at

691
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:29,299
another employer that I had exactly the

692
00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:31,460
same role that I had been in so I was

693
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:33,379
able to use some of the bullets that

694
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:37,010
were out there because I was refreshing

695
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:39,200
my memory of okay you know what I think

696
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:41,150
that the information to build your

697
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,770
resumes out there clearly don't copy on

698
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:44,780
the place like you're the CEO of a

699
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:47,840
company if you're not with all the fake

700
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:50,899
responsibilities so but yes I mean

701
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:56,209
you're absolutely right and John in that

702
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:59,150
domain should it replying for a

703
00:33:56,210 --> 00:34:02,120
technical job IT and

704
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:05,930
we have past work extra that's not high

705
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:09,199
tea should we include that right the

706
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:12,230
only siren included would be if it's in

707
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:16,069
our industry okay because super one

708
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:18,889
industry for example if you worked maybe

709
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:20,510
you didn't have a maybe it was not an IT

710
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:21,830
related job but if you were working in

711
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:24,800
healthcare and you're applying at

712
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:27,590
Walmart I would definitely list that you

713
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,960
had experience working within healthcare

714
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:32,330
because you may have had access to

715
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:35,449
maybe compliance documents that were

716
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:37,569
related to health care that would parley

717
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:41,120
to someone it's also kind of a key word

718
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:42,860
it's amazing because just little things

719
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,109
like that will differentiate with

720
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:48,200
someone that has zero health care if you

721
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:51,530
work in a call center for five years for

722
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:54,710
Wellmark old for an insurance company

723
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:57,100
even though it's not you know a desk or

724
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:59,810
a pen tester or anything like that

725
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:01,940
having that is going to give you an edge

726
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:04,549
it's going to be a passport in your

727
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:06,200
standard so definitely if the job is

728
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:13,460
within the same and you should even if

729
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:15,290
it's not you know I do clearly you know

730
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:17,000
including the keywords so if you're

731
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:19,009
applying for a job and you're not

732
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,600
leveraging the keywords of the job

733
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:22,880
description you're going to be passed

734
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,390
over I mean that's just that's just the

735
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,930
way it is

736
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:28,670
chronology use proper ten secured

737
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:31,190
accordingly so everything that you have

738
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:32,510
achieved should be in the past and then

739
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:35,660
everything that you're doing right now

740
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:39,860
should be current skip pictures no art

741
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:43,460
my hot situations where I get a resume

742
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:45,300
and it's just very creative but I'm not

743
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:48,570
we're not working on

744
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:50,430
a creative project there and so so we

745
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:52,140
don't do not include your picture for

746
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:55,259
some little picture ever the only

747
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:57,240
picture that you you get could have is

748
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:00,480
on your LinkedIn but never on your

749
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:02,520
resume and no art no more little flowers

750
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,400
or anything and I've seen that within

751
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:08,790
the IT world and it's just you're going

752
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:11,280
to be skipped over all right so let's

753
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:13,860
take a look at an entry-level resume so

754
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,230
basically you're going to have a summary

755
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:18,360
of qualification you're going to list

756
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:21,080
the number of years that you have within

757
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:23,910
that role if you have worked on other

758
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:26,610
projects - I would add that as well

759
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:28,890
so just it has to reflect your story and

760
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:32,340
like I said the resume is your

761
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:35,250
professional DNA also the level of

762
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:38,760
professions in programs operating system

763
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:42,180
and you want an IT definitely problem

764
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:44,490
solver and technical communication the

765
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:47,520
the challenge that I've had is there's

766
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:49,470
in terms of resume not addressing

767
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,090
communication and relative ility with

768
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:54,060
other teams if you have to work with the

769
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:55,950
business side and you're just not able

770
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:58,770
to communicate you're not going to be

771
00:36:55,950 --> 00:37:00,660
able to get into the door so really one

772
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:05,009
of the bullets and summaries should be

773
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:09,299
communication communication building

774
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:11,370
trust across business lines or teams

775
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:13,620
that's really important if you're a

776
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:16,700
level resume fully education is going to

777
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:18,810
be the most recent qualification

778
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:21,950
programming languages software apps

779
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:24,440
database management operating systems

780
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:26,669
including professional experience

781
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:30,450
conferences in volunteer activities

782
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:32,790
those are very important - this is a

783
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:34,589
little bit different I put this I

784
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:37,890
thought that I'm sense but it shows

785
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:40,680
titles and years of experience and then

786
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:42,390
kind of from the range of here so I

787
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,730
don't know if you can see but from zero

788
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:56,580
to three years or two six seven

789
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:57,960
to 15 and 20 plus mid-level so mid-level

790
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:02,340
is going to be a little bit different

791
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:04,860
you're really in terms of having a brief

792
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:07,860
paragraph about your skills and breadth

793
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:10,200
of experience it's really like a medium

794
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:12,450
to a mini bio it's really going to

795
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:15,569
compile the breadth of knowledge you can

796
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:19,350
find templates and samples really pretty

797
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:22,260
much on the web but this is really the

798
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:24,230
official title of where you want to be

799
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:27,600
and the experience in the field that

800
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:30,240
brief summary then what I do see is

801
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:32,819
really the areas of expertise so you're

802
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,399
going to have I see most of them

803
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:38,400
mid-level having nine different areas it

804
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:40,530
can grow even higher technical

805
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,170
proficiency the platform networking

806
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:44,730
languages and tools and then

807
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:47,820
professional experience from the

808
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:50,220
enrolment any mutation so I'm really

809
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:53,220
really really basic and today I'm not

810
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:57,180
doing a huge final critique dive but

811
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:59,759
that's that's one of them and then Tory

812
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:02,220
executive raised for me I'm just showing

813
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,780
a little bit of a snapshot that really

814
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:05,879
the credentials are going to be on the

815
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:07,410
top not saying that if you don't have

816
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,060
credentials in the mid-level that you

817
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:11,609
wouldn't put it but put all your

818
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:14,310
certification right after you're your

819
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:17,940
first name that is going to end up so

820
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:20,009
when I see a lot of the CISOs I'm going

821
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,720
to see just a series of all their

822
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:25,470
certification that's going to be the get

823
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:28,040
go executive summary that's going to be

824
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:31,350
a little bit longer core competencies

825
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:33,150
industries so now for this level for

826
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:35,310
executives you're going to have a lot

827
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:39,540
more projects within a variety of

828
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:43,410
industries at least that's what I'm

829
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:45,090
serving also selected achievements not

830
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:46,830
that you can't but you can do that in

831
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:48,870
mid-level as well but selected

832
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:50,220
achievements multiple bullet points

833
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:51,160
they're going to show really the

834
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:54,310
financial

835
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:56,620
the business impact so those details

836
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:58,420
again are going to be important

837
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:01,060
affiliations because at that level

838
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:03,400
you're probably among growers you're

839
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:06,520
attending very formal conferences I mean

840
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:09,040
those are going to spend out at that

841
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,030
level it's it's going to be a snap

842
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,570
everywhere

843
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:15,970
most of the people will harvest soon or

844
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:17,890
affiliation and the education is at the

845
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:21,779
end of the resume so it's really

846
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:26,680
interesting that truly even if you have

847
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:29,050
multiple education tracks educate in the

848
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:33,609
executive resume the education is going

849
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:36,220
to be really the last last area because

850
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:40,060
of all the project experience and the

851
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:42,220
exposure that you've had many

852
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:43,930
credentials so you're putting your if

853
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:45,189
you put your name at the top and then

854
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:47,500
like shortly thereafter all the

855
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:49,330
credentials here but not like CISSP

856
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,070
everyone's mother of that right yeah

857
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:53,020
what about you're more like there's an

858
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:55,540
arcane certification something I mean

859
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:58,330
because does the reviewer this person

860
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:59,950
like you or who's selecting do you waste

861
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:02,440
the time like looking up like what is

862
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:04,470
this like Sam's have something I would

863
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:07,690
have a really like that no wonder

864
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:09,490
absolutely because that is typically

865
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:12,250
neither equity I would always look like

866
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:15,459
that but the you think about the hiring

867
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:17,890
manager it's where you are and your

868
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:19,480
language that you're in the hiring

869
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:22,450
manager is going to see that in

870
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:24,790
absolutely be found so never shy away

871
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:27,879
from certifications you pay for them

872
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:30,520
you've invested in them and they will

873
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:35,880
stand out against any of the competitors

874
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:39,040
or other people who are who are

875
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:43,000
submitting their resume

876
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:45,759
oh so and I think I've got a really fast

877
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,220
but I have a lot more of it so maybe in

878
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,530
sense so how do you hear when you're

879
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:54,129
talking about certifications right how

880
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:57,640
did you note if you helped write the

881
00:41:54,130 --> 00:42:00,070
circuit I would say I would I concluded

882
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:04,270
that in the many executive summary or

883
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:08,560
above I would absolutely offer them

884
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:10,240
contributed to - you know I know

885
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,430
how many people are getting certified

886
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,259
now me that that would be really

887
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:20,319
critical to have that with your great

888
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:25,240
story so I know I've kind of students

889
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:28,150
really I any give you tips on online

890
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:43,180
interviews online interviews so when you

891
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:47,050
need feedback from hiring managers yeah

892
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:50,169
I'm seeing that a lot more clearly being

893
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:53,110
professional and having the best like

894
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:57,450
setup because any technical technology

895
00:42:53,110 --> 00:43:00,970
issues is going to be the two of you

896
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:02,680
super prepared the key would be well if

897
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:05,589
you're going to go to a recruiter with

898
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,370
that they'll know exactly the setup and

899
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:08,950
you can rehearse

900
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:11,950
I would definitely practice as many

901
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:14,740
times as you can with your recruiter the

902
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:16,299
recruiter also may have had other

903
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:18,700
candidates that they're submitting for

904
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:23,650
this role and may have an insight for

905
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:26,569
you so for example when one key question

906
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:28,880
to ask a recruit is how many candidates

907
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:31,700
for this role and again I'm using just

908
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:34,580
the recruiter both for that because then

909
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:35,960
if one candidate is interviewing first

910
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:38,900
you'll get more insight on another

911
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,820
matter as the second person if you can

912
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:43,160
find out where you're interviewing for

913
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:52,490
that role what other questions are going

914
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:55,339
to ask before crossing the boundary Oh

915
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:58,549
so you won't really a wide breath on

916
00:43:55,340 --> 00:44:05,510
yeah maybe this a couple four yeah first

917
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:07,450
step I would say when you you be very so

918
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:10,520
there's a lot of recruiters out there

919
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:12,169
but understanding the culture of whether

920
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,940
recruiter is working in terms of

921
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:16,880
typically people know who are the good

922
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:19,190
firms and the bad firms when you meet

923
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,900
that recruiter is that person really how

924
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:24,140
long have they been in the job

925
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:27,070
themselves you know do they have a

926
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:29,509
direct relationship with a hiring me

927
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:33,110
that's really important because then

928
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:35,240
you'll get really good insight about the

929
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:37,450
role there are three ways I would say

930
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:39,830
that I get roles one is going to be

931
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:41,839
through direct relationships so I know

932
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:45,200
the hiring leaders so I know the format

933
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:47,870
and his or her personality and routine

934
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,939
so I can give you some insights that no

935
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:52,910
one else can give you because I have a

936
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:55,280
trusted relationship so it's just for

937
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:57,710
you to connect and really they already

938
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:00,380
trust me in placing the right person in

939
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:03,440
their environment the second one is

940
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:04,940
going to be where I'm a vendor and I

941
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,950
just get the job description that I

942
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:09,140
don't get to ask any questions I always

943
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:11,240
have to look through HR and I'm in a

944
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:13,759
standstill I'm not quite sure how many

945
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:15,799
candidates are applied so the field is a

946
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,140
little bit different the third way to

947
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:20,980
place is really my favorite and I think

948
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:23,710
in the startup community that's a little

949
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:26,560
that easier is maybe there's not a

950
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:28,720
formal job description that my goal is

951
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:30,430
to break the brokerage the relationship

952
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,129
and the introduction so I set you up

953
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:34,990
with coffee with a sleazy CEO of the

954
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:37,030
company and you have coffee and you

955
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:39,910
share your interest in your experience

956
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:42,730
and then a job is created it sounds

957
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:44,828
crazy it's extremely rare through the

958
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:47,109
pipeline and the time and that's why I

959
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:48,640
always say you know sorry I was going to

960
00:45:47,109 --> 00:45:51,609
be a really great opportunity for you to

961
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:53,170
develop your skills but those are I

962
00:45:51,609 --> 00:45:56,319
would say we're really critical if you

963
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:58,119
come from the consulting world and

964
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,970
you're looking to stay in consulting

965
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:04,420
always give a range to the recruiter

966
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:06,939
never say the straight figure the range

967
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:09,990
is crucial because they can be a

968
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:13,000
variance of budget for the hourly rate

969
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:16,990
the most people who just gave a straight

970
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,849
figure are going to be painless so by

971
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:20,979
giving a range to the recruiter you said

972
00:46:18,849 --> 00:46:22,990
this is the minimum that I accept hey I

973
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:25,869
can get at the sweet spot you more

974
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:29,348
likely to security and that's the same

975
00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:31,420
for salary and compound compensation so

976
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:33,430
one of the other tips I would say when

977
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:36,069
you're working with a recruiter and

978
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:38,379
they're like what's your salary they

979
00:46:36,069 --> 00:46:40,390
should ask you know what's your current

980
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:43,150
compensations salary but where do you

981
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:45,310
want to be you should be get whole when

982
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:46,869
you're transitioning to a new job I've

983
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:48,970
seen situation or whether a recruiter

984
00:46:46,869 --> 00:46:51,730
did not inform the candidate and that

985
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:56,589
person actually took a pay cut and so

986
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:58,240
you know again the world is really also

987
00:46:56,589 --> 00:46:59,799
understanding the benefits when you're

988
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,959
transitioning from one company to

989
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,880
another again being kept or are you

990
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:07,000
going to leave a bonus and end of the

991
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:09,010
year those are really important so for

992
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,750
salary and hourly do your research

993
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:12,670
there's a couple of things that I would

994
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:15,309
go on pay scale is

995
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:18,369
website I would say check it out a

996
00:47:15,309 --> 00:47:20,140
really great way to find for salaries

997
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:23,099
don't trust LinkedIn to give you a

998
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:26,650
salary range typically it's not accurate

999
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:31,630
you'll see also understands some

1000
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:34,000
information so all the salary in Expo

1001
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:36,490
stack you can find that information but

1002
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,040
be very educated about your value in the

1003
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:41,770
market right now your skills are so

1004
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:44,230
needed this is a great time for your

1005
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:47,410
room and the hourly or the salary that

1006
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:49,569
you want so salary is going to be your

1007
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:51,640
base salary and compensation is all the

1008
00:47:49,569 --> 00:47:55,359
add-on so one of the things when I

1009
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:57,040
negotiate a like even though that was

1010
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:59,799
not a personal placement of their week

1011
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:02,710
field and help negotiate a salary

1012
00:47:59,799 --> 00:48:05,770
increase by five thousand dollars last

1013
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:10,059
week and it's really important companies

1014
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:12,220
do expect to be negotiated with so you

1015
00:48:10,059 --> 00:48:14,290
know typically what I would say for a

1016
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:17,020
salary when you're applying for a new

1017
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:17,980
job between five to seven thousand is

1018
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:21,849
not unreasonable

1019
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:23,829
there's a reason unreasonable to ask for

1020
00:48:21,849 --> 00:48:28,000
if you've got some certification that's

1021
00:48:23,829 --> 00:48:32,740
going to town so really researching your

1022
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,690
value in the market is crucial it's a

1023
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:35,529
good way to start that conversation so

1024
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:42,040
to get after

1025
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:44,410
and you ask for more disagreeable good

1026
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:46,390
thing to be so how do you start that

1027
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:49,930
conversation when you've already enough

1028
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:52,990
offered a job I would say and I can send

1029
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:55,810
you a what I wrote to help with that

1030
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:58,660
negotiation but I recollected so I love

1031
00:48:55,810 --> 00:49:01,660
that the Job Description again and I

1032
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:04,480
recollected the specific industry that I

1033
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:06,250
spent time in and specific projects that

1034
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,730
are going to impact immediately the

1035
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:11,710
company and then explain in very

1036
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:14,680
portable way that my value in the market

1037
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:18,280
this is where I felt I feel like I've

1038
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:21,580
learned to be at this so they are ways

1039
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:26,020
to craft it in a very very cordial way

1040
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:27,430
and typically that's not turned down the

1041
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:31,150
other thing when you do a negotiation

1042
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:34,750
again that's not really resume writing

1043
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:38,250
but you can negotiate coolly PTO a lot

1044
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:41,440
of people forget that you can negotiate

1045
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:43,750
sometimes sign on bonus too so if you're

1046
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,340
leaving something on and the company if

1047
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:47,620
you're going to transition and you're

1048
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:50,230
going to leave a bone though to be kept

1049
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:55,240
cold make sure that you negotiate that

1050
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:57,580
hard also I would say typically but look

1051
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:59,109
also at your expenditures in terms of

1052
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:01,900
where you want to invest for your

1053
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:04,930
education the conference's make sure you

1054
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:07,060
lease list those because again when you

1055
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:09,190
enter in that negotiation phase having

1056
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:11,020
all those different areas you may not

1057
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:13,090
get everything that you cannot get what

1058
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:16,240
you don't ask for so those are really

1059
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:19,840
really important you might ask for their

1060
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:22,290
range and if you said you should give up

1061
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:25,810
a range but can we ask for their very

1062
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:27,460
typically I would say you can ask some

1063
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:31,350
of us all the recruiters might be

1064
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:31,350
internal recruiters in the company

1065
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:36,780
birds that not get my babies until I

1066
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:38,970
could hear what they're pairing yeah I

1067
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:42,200
would say in a situation like that well

1068
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:45,000
you know I by putting the range

1069
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:47,250
typically if you look if you do your

1070
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,049
research for others and there's a lot of

1071
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:53,069
different sources you can find what

1072
00:50:49,049 --> 00:50:55,440
would be accurate in the market you know

1073
00:50:53,069 --> 00:50:58,589
it also some on the network that you

1074
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,510
have an event like one kind of prospect

1075
00:50:58,589 --> 00:51:02,369
hiring managers may be able to confirm

1076
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:04,740
to you what they see in the market for

1077
00:51:02,369 --> 00:51:07,049
that type of role so that's why you know

1078
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:10,140
networking and friendship is great but

1079
00:51:07,049 --> 00:51:12,329
it's a resources on professional growth

1080
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:14,400
right here because someone right here

1081
00:51:12,329 --> 00:51:17,069
that you're sitting next to you can tell

1082
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:22,140
you all how to find that range so having

1083
00:51:17,069 --> 00:51:24,119
you know depending but really again you

1084
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:27,960
feel that you're in the dollars are

1085
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:31,290
flowing rapidly and you have that

1086
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:33,240
question so that was that yeah so when

1087
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:35,220
you meet the recruiter I reassert and

1088
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:38,520
they ask you you know what you know

1089
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:40,709
what's your current hourly rates and you

1090
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:42,059
know you know actually right now where I

1091
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:44,369
would you feel comfortable would be

1092
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:46,500
between this rate than this rate and if

1093
00:51:44,369 --> 00:51:49,170
you have your own company you'll be

1094
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:50,849
called in 1099 so that's going to you'll

1095
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:54,290
have the burden of the taxes so that's

1096
00:51:50,849 --> 00:51:59,190
going to be a little higher about eight

1097
00:51:54,290 --> 00:52:02,339
dollars per chance so there was Indiana

1098
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:05,280
a little bonus about why making wheat

1099
00:52:02,339 --> 00:52:07,710
field partners so this is my farm this

1100
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:10,859
is where I grew up on so you can see the

1101
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:14,299
we I don't think this is that we mrs.

1102
00:52:10,859 --> 00:52:16,859
kornpett important was over here

1103
00:52:14,299 --> 00:52:18,869
symbolism for a week for me is really

1104
00:52:16,859 --> 00:52:21,630
let me turn into bread and bread is

1105
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:24,960
prosperity to the table and sharing the

1106
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:27,000
wealth partners is because really it's

1107
