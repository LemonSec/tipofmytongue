1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:08,910
right so I I'm here to talk about

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:11,820
hacking gently so what I did there lamb

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,349
before we get into any about I'm Anna

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,540
children born an American raised

5
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,690
blacksmith my specialize in traditional

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,730
methods it's nine I did a nail I got

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,699
completely addicted started classes at

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,949
twelve apprenticed at the Hancock Shaker

9
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,220
Village for four years and then ran that

10
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:34,739
Forge and then I started my own business

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:36,269
in 2017 so why am I here I'm gonna be

12
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,029
talking about the history of steel so

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,649
what it actually is on a chemical level

14
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:45,149
how this is happening because while it

15
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:46,879
seems a little weird is the parts of a

16
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:48,840
knife and language surrounding that

17
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,870
everybody knows what I'm talking about

18
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,840
if I say things like education trigger

19
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:57,269
cancer whatever how those things

20
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,719
translate into real life different uses

21
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,280
for its geometry different temper colors

22
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,589
and their purpose and why you should or

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,100
should not change thank you because

24
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:10,170
that's an option so let's start at the

25
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,000
beginning with history at some point

26
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,869
some guys saw a rock like that

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,049
and decided to crush it and put it

28
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:22,979
through a sieve until he had that then

29
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:24,990
heated up with coal or charcoal and they

30
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:30,150
ended up with that weird sponge

31
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:32,360
okay so that is iron in its most basic

32
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,360
form

33
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:39,570
in this iron there's an almost no carbon

34
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,570
and that makes it incredibly soft

35
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,589
there's I'm gonna be getting this into

36
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,219
this in a bit

37
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:51,360
there's a trade-off for spring softness

38
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:54,329
and for tension and overall performance

39
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,819
and you sort of have to pick which

40
00:01:54,329 --> 00:02:03,630
aligns naturally you're doing at that

41
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:08,060
moment so here's the that chart ever

42
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:10,049
attention mainly at this point

43
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,489
commercially available not you made out

44
00:02:10,049 --> 00:02:15,260
of stainless steel and that's great they

45
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:19,579
don't rust they're easier to make but

46
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:21,540
they're soft and they have chromium so

47
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:24,239
adding different things to iron it

48
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:27,540
changes the effect if you add carbon you

49
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:31,560
get harder metal in the end if you had a

50
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:36,780
silicate you get a resistant metal to

51
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:42,600
things like cracking yeah it's all about

52
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:45,930
just sort of finding a balance so in

53
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:49,200
other words but handle tang bolster heel

54
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,700
spine edge tipping point I'm mainly

55
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,560
going to be focusing on talking about

56
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:58,798
the edge tip today because most

57
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,660
universally useful parts yeah I kind of

58
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:01,580
doubt realistically that many of you

59
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,730
were going to go

60
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,890
make knives based on this talk but but

61
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:08,450
you could do is take that one kitchen

62
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:14,239
knife that you had that's garbage and

63
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:16,970
turn it into something good temporary

64
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:20,060
and temporary colors these are the first

65
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:27,170
thing you looking at if you hold the

66
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:30,800
knife at an angle you can see different

67
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:35,269
colors inside the steel lose those

68
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:37,520
Pink's that ground is everything as you

69
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:39,470
increase the temperature the color

70
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:43,670
changes and that's how we engage

71
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:46,430
temperature because it's fast things

72
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:51,170
that are up here at the Bluebird ends of

73
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:52,730
the spectrum are very soft they won't

74
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:55,160
hold an edge very well but if you need

75
00:03:52,730 --> 00:04:00,019
something that's flexible like a fencing

76
00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:02,960
sword it's perfect Dampier at the 350

77
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:08,030
400 440 mark that's most chefs knives

78
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:13,100
they're made to be not quite brittle but

79
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:17,110
one step below it Japanese knives it's

80
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,110
different because

81
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:26,029
HG entrence those are the things that

82
00:04:23,249 --> 00:04:29,969
actually make nice

83
00:04:26,029 --> 00:04:33,629
western knives have edge geometries that

84
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:38,219
are wider they're more similar to access

85
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:43,020
like this one so that once that's flat

86
00:04:38,219 --> 00:04:44,939
the other side is entangled that lets

87
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,620
you take something that's round and turn

88
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:48,180
it square

89
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,830
but if you're left-handed you can't use

90
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:56,969
this axe because of the direction of

91
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:58,800
that though all the wages are what we're

92
00:04:56,969 --> 00:05:01,110
gonna find on straight razors not really

93
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,400
look like maybe this chisel edge

94
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:07,020
Japanese knives convex edges and the

95
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:15,779
edges are the most common in western

96
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:18,960
knives so how wide we change energy on

97
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:22,710
tree if your knife that is garbage in

98
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,650
the kitchen is cutting and vegetables at

99
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:26,520
odd angles or not straight or not even

100
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,589
coming at all

101
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,068
you need to start looking at what the

102
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:36,840
energy on the tree is traditional

103
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:38,770
methods rocks basically and

104
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:52,388
hours and hours and hours with these

105
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:55,030
things exactly the lower the grip the

106
00:05:52,389 --> 00:06:00,449
more metal you take off in each swipe so

107
00:05:55,030 --> 00:06:05,138
that was 220 and then this one is 8,000

108
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:07,330
yeah I didn't know they got that fine oh

109
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:14,259
they go higher do they're really yeah

110
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:23,198
the Japanese sword smiths have yeah

111
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:29,130
everything from like 50 to contemporary

112
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:30,400
methods rely on engine powered

113
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:32,770
rhinestones

114
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,690
it's the same concept but with an engine

115
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:38,380
attachment instead of pushing with your

116
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:40,690
foot or just your hands my problem with

117
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,610
these is that you can heat up the blade

118
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:44,919
bring it quickly on them and turn the

119
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:47,949
tip or a part of the H blue do you do

120
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:49,549
that you have effectively read tempered

121
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:52,639
the blade in that section

122
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,639
[Music]

123
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:09,069
yeah Jenny is geometry is as simple as

124
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:11,710
looking at what existing edge is how it

125
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:14,250
works and changing it to suit your

126
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:18,190
purposes if you're cutting through

127
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:19,990
softer things specially Tomatoes fish

128
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:24,699
that kind of stuff you want very thin

129
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:29,500
knife and you want an edge geometry of

130
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:32,740
around seven degrees your earth yeah

131
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:34,300
European knives have more of a convex

132
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,919
edge geometry because they're designed

133
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,539
to cut through the bone and flesh as

134
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:45,460
opposed to soft more delicate things

135
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:48,818
fish um yeah so sharp inacol sharpening

136
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:50,500
knives isn't as hard as many people seem

137
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:51,759
to think it is it don't get me wrong

138
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,979
it's not easy there are a lot of

139
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,479
different methods you can use a lot of

140
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:59,258
we make it really easy some of them are

141
00:07:55,479 --> 00:08:01,150
a little more complex like these you

142
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:04,630
need to first match the angle that is

143
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:07,989
existing if you're just trying to show

144
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:10,389
them with a lower Crittenden

145
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:13,569
you're trying to polish the very very

146
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:16,029
edge of the knife to be as smooth and

147
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:18,639
shiny as you can because if you do that

148
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:24,279
you know that you have a very fine

149
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:26,759
surface requires less pressure to select

150
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:26,759
or the same

151
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,300
these guys recommend putting coins

152
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,740
underneath the spine if you're nice that

153
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:37,189
we slide them back and forth it can't

154
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:39,799
move up or down my only problem with

155
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:44,449
that is that it fills the pores and

156
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:48,339
Stemmons we come over neck and that

157
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:48,339
would adversely affect you as you keep

158
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:56,750
going up through the grits

159
00:08:52,810 --> 00:09:05,060
it takes practice but you would stop

160
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:07,579
feeling an improvement in the swampy so

161
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,989
changing the edge geometry and this is

162
00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:12,609
the part where it's actually getting it

163
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:12,610
to happen you're taking

164
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:20,980
a knife that has a existing purpose and

165
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,930
breaking you're saying okay I don't want

166
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,579
that anymore I'm butchering more fish

167
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:27,279
these days so I'm going to take this

168
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:30,310
young tree make it slick

169
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,769
so first figure out what your actual

170
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:36,339
angle is not just adjusting in some

171
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:40,560
direction figure out what you're trying

172
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:44,760
to cut with it what angle you use and

173
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,760
the action of that modifying it

174
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,129
so the takeaways from this the steel

175
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,949
matters they're kind of steel that

176
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:56,959
you're nice it's made out of it's going

177
00:09:54,949 --> 00:10:00,979
to really affect how long you can shake

178
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:04,189
it if you get something that's too hard

179
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:07,069
and you drop it once you go crack steel

180
00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:09,529
is when you harden it and temper it

181
00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:12,019
there are a lot of internal stresses in

182
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:14,300
the steel millions of micro fractures so

183
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:18,829
if you take a piece of steel that's only

184
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:20,839
been hardened and table that's when you

185
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:22,489
temper it so raise the temperature up a

186
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:29,959
couple hundred degrees you relieve all

187
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:32,209
those stresses the edge matters

188
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:34,518
check your edge geometry before you

189
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:37,868
start changing things figure out what is

190
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:37,869
wrong with the knife through using

191
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,180
it the changes in the knife will sneak

192
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,620
up on you

193
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:46,069
so they'll think you're sitting that for

194
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,450
six hours not making any progress also

195
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:51,480
she's totally different and you messed

196
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:53,670
it up the edge can be hacked you can

197
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,070
take a cleaver and turn it into a

198
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:58,199
skeleton that's an option you just need

199
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:02,220
to change the angle at which the knife

200
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:04,230
is actually terminating knives can be

201
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:07,260
sharpened there are lots of tools and

202
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,610
ways to sharpen as I said I like

203
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,480
traditional Japanese or Chinese

204
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,270
Whetstone's

205
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:15,390
I know a lot of people like things like

206
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:17,699
wicked edge it's a little vice that has

207
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:22,920
arms connected to it that's very

208
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:25,830
specific angles like pieces down plate

209
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:29,630
that works it's fine it's kind of

210
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:32,250
expensive but you don't need to practice

211
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:34,170
yeah the trick really is to commit to

212
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,240
learning to sharpen well if you want to

213
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,339
do traditional methods it's gonna take

214
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,000
longer

215
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:44,610
you build at the end have a more custom

216
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,380
edge than you would if you used one of

217
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:51,960
those machines and you know for a fact

218
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:54,950
that not gonna overheat them which is

219
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,950
very great advice

220
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:59,979
basically what you'll do spend you know

221
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:02,199
3,000 dollars on his beautiful

222
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:10,200
that's been handed in Japan underground

223
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:10,200
or once in us we do it

224
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,610
sharpening well is easier than it seems

225
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:17,350
it's all about matching the geometry you

226
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,090
can do with your eyes you don't even you

227
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:21,670
don't need high power tools you don't

228
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:23,290
need a lecture chromatic graphs to

229
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:26,500
figure out the exact density of this

230
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:28,420
stuff you just need to look at it most

231
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,060
of the time and if you know what you're

232
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:33,550
looking for these things are pretty

233
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:36,040
trivial to solve I'm going to be doing a

234
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:39,310
demo on sharpening and I'll be adjusting

235
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:43,300
the edge geometry on one of the sides of

236
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:48,489
this knife I sharpen this this morning

237
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:53,609
just sort of practice but I don't like

238
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:53,610
the way that the edge on the left is

239
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:02,110
more convex geometry meaning that it's

240
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:06,270
harder to make fine cuts and because

241
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:06,270
that thing's so lightweight you don't

242
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:12,490
you can do it it's check YouTube check

243
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,900
all these things you don't need to

244
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:17,230
invest in these kinds of stones you can

245
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:20,350
start with sandpaper if you take low

246
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:22,360
grit sandpaper and just put it on a

247
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:28,480
table and rub it at the right angle can

248
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:30,940
totally work it's not quite as romantic

249
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,790
as sitting there with wet stones for a

250
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:38,010
couple of hours but it gets the job done

251
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:41,620
every paper is what you're looking for

252
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:42,660
standard aluminum oxide sandpaper breaks

253
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,290
reading

254
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:49,439
quickly we started running it on sale do

255
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:53,699
you let the paper at all or oil the

256
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,680
paper paper you can do wet or dry those

257
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:58,740
stem amines you have to soak it for

258
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,300
around 10 minutes more usually they're

259
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,889
incredibly for us these things are

260
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:05,269
basically sponges when you look at all

261
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:09,209
the bubbles thank you for now accessory

262
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:11,370
once those pores are filled you are you

263
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:13,290
can be sure that there's enough water on

264
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:15,600
the surface of the stone to serve as a

265
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:17,129
lubricant for the steel and also in

266
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,000
traits that you aren't filling all the

267
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:28,680
little pockets with because that will

268
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:34,079
ruin your so yeah that's basically my

269
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:37,050
talk about any questions so when you're

270
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:40,079
sharpening with the paper yes what is

271
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:44,640
the best start does it depend on what

272
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:46,140
we always start at a low grade lower the

273
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,730
grade the more metal in you're gonna be

274
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,949
taking off so unless you have chips

275
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:53,310
taking out the edge of a knife don't go

276
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:56,280
below 500 just it's not worth it it'll

277
00:14:53,310 --> 00:15:01,170
take forever if you have chips in an

278
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:08,760
edge like this or steak or something you

279
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:10,439
need to go down to like 50 all the metal

280
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:17,520
up until the lowest point for those

281
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:21,540
chips basically yeah start to finish

282
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:27,290
this knife took around 20 hours when I

283
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:30,270
got it was coil-spring French yeah

284
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:33,959
well a lot of my knives are made out of

285
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:36,569
sort of reclaimed materials I take a lot

286
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:42,990
of garage door opener Springs and use

287
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:44,580
those carbon content yeah unless I need

288
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:49,310
to know exactly what how the knife is

289
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:49,310
going to perform I'm like it's just

290
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,380
yeah

291
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:57,110
so that one knife in your kitchen that

292
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:59,420
is absolutely garbage still haven't run

293
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:00,620
out it's sitting there every time you

294
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:03,979
see it and think about grabbing it

295
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:05,600
within your wall all its are that's

296
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,779
because I've had to convex and edge

297
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,870
geometry sheet knives they send the

298
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:13,699
blanks so the knife that's doesn't have

299
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:16,519
a handle yet not polished they send

300
00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:24,349
those on a conveyor belt to angle

301
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:26,329
grinders and they're set to a 45-degree

302
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:29,870
angle and the knife goes through once

303
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:32,449
and that's sharpie for that I don't do

304
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:37,040
that I sit there for six hours you're

305
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:38,689
looking perfect you can't change it and

306
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,949
that's really sort of a point I'm trying

307
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,959
to get across you don't need to spend

308
00:16:39,949 --> 00:16:43,880
$900 on the knife to get something good

309
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:47,829
you can go to a thrift store pick up a

310
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,829
$2.00 knife just change it

311
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:52,339
yeah

312
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:59,000
and there are if you guys google night

313
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:01,670
sharpening there's going to be a million

314
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,800
different methods the stuff I'm talking

315
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:07,550
about today that's not all of it not

316
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:10,879
even close but what I'm trying to get

317
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:13,359
across with that changing metal isn't as

318
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:17,120
hard as people seem to think it's not a

319
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:21,458
constant material that's always true

320
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,458
to want to change into your purse

321
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:29,290
where do you get the Emery cloth from is

322
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:31,929
that just like a poser

323
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:34,090
yeah even in today's um this I think a

324
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:36,370
dollar a she it's it's more expensive

325
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:39,040
than regular sandpaper it lasts longer

326
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:41,169
for them they go up that her I should

327
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:43,510
say that fight of a grit like at a

328
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:45,340
typical hardware store at a Sippel

329
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:47,440
hardware store you can get at least up

330
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,800
to 1500 grit okay

331
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,900
and that's funny sharp for any

332
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,909
applications unless you're trying to

333
00:17:52,900 --> 00:18:02,560
perform surgery with these knives you

334
00:17:54,910 --> 00:18:11,920
usually don't have to yeah never way I

335
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:13,720
can tell the stones I have down oh

336
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,730
absolutely

337
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,500
so if you want to figure out what great

338
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:19,240
it is that's a little bit more

339
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,710
complicated basically just sit there

340
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,510
with an assortment of sandpaper above

341
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:27,010
the sandpaper rubbish going figure out

342
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:29,710
what's the same okay if the stone has

343
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:31,330
waves in it and that's called a special

344
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:35,560
opening one spot over and over again

345
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:39,699
where else don't get this Bose that's a

346
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:43,020
serious issue and stuff and that's an

347
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,020
optional you have to take a cinderblock

348
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:52,270
hmm yeah knife maintenance keep the

349
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,010
blades try if they're carbon steel if

350
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:57,400
not don't worry about it

351
00:18:54,010 --> 00:19:00,310
please please please please do not soak

352
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,690
the handles of your knives ever doesn't

353
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:03,940
matter what they're made out of however

354
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,760
they're connected like the handle

355
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,290
materials connect it to the steel

356
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:11,290
there's something there that really does

357
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:15,399
getting wet keep knives striking from

358
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:17,460
sharp we don't have a good time yeah

359
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:20,380
don't be this super expensive knife to

360
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:23,020
cover the food you don't need really

361
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:25,900
expensive my first to be sharpie you

362
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:28,889
just need to know some of the ideas

363
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,890
behind it

364
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:32,649
yeah

365
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:37,570
so when you say don't soak the handles

366
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,110
for kitchen knives and that kind of

367
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,260
stuff

368
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:43,780
keep them on with the dishwasher never

369
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:45,340
put sharp knives in the dishwasher just

370
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:47,470
don't do it it will ruin the edge

371
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:50,590
completely like that you can take a

372
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:55,150
scalpel put in the dishwasher take it

373
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:57,939
out with this butter knife yes just

374
00:19:55,150 --> 00:20:03,640
buying knives every time in fact buy

375
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:06,070
them from me being a banker you where do

376
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:09,070
we find you go online or burn for that

377
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:14,550
kind of thing I am at Latino Forge I

378
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:14,550
also have business cards oh oh

379
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,480
absolutely

380
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:49,620
so for every day knocking hi

381
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:52,530
yes Carrie do you have a specific angle

382
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:55,229
that you tend to like more than another

383
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:59,550
or it really depends on what you're

384
00:20:55,230 --> 00:21:01,370
doing the edge geometry is not defined

385
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:05,610
by the shape of the blade right

386
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:08,550
completely separate if you're cutting

387
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:10,580
cardboard boxes open and you just need

388
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:14,070
something that will slash through stuff

389
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:16,260
get a convex edge even if it goes down

390
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:20,310
you can still cut things with it or with

391
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:23,129
a super slim edge geometry the whole

392
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:27,990
edge just gets rounded and you won't

393
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:30,600
have a good time cutting anything I like

394
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:34,050
personally slimmer edge geometries for

395
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:36,780
everything I just had find it easier to

396
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:39,659
cut through things Wisthoff does

397
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:43,649
something like a 45 no 35 degree angle

398
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:45,150
on their knives I do seven so yeah a

399
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:48,270
little bit of it a little bit of a

400
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:52,610
difference yeah and again that's why I

401
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:55,560
don't really prefer the wicked sharp

402
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:57,899
models they don't get me wrong they're

403
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,790
great they will put a fantastic edge on

404
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:02,040
any of your knives as long as they are

405
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:03,930
commercially available in western if

406
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:06,980
they are Japanese don't even think about

407
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:09,330
it it's too expensive and

408
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:10,500
there are too many little pieces you

409
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:13,340
need to add on where you could just

410
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:22,170
spend 50 bucks again one of those sounds

411
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:24,270
yeah the arm to it yes yeah that's all

412
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:26,610
the knife and yeah that's what I do with

413
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:28,740
mine I got mine set it right at about 20

414
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:30,780
25 and it works pretty good but I find

415
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:34,920
that it does go dull relatively fast

416
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:38,129
okay and the other the other portions to

417
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:42,720
consider are the type of Steel that's

418
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:47,280
being used and how the template was the

419
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:49,860
temper will determine the lifespan of an

420
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,230
image more than anything

421
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:55,439
aside from maybe the type of Steel

422
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:59,340
you're using there are now contemporary

423
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:05,190
air hardening alloys where you make the

424
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:07,169
knife take it out you sharpen it as it

425
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:09,180
gets more exposure to oxygen as harder

426
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:10,530
and stronger eventually you won't even

427
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:14,250
be able to scratch it with sandpaper

428
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:17,490
it just won't happen you will not lose

429
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:21,530
that edge that's crazy

430
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:25,070
yeah now the drawbacks to these are that

431
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:28,500
yep it's a radiator super high toughness

432
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:31,139
super high edge retention completely

433
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,790
garbage ease of sharpening and corrosion

434
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:36,240
resistance will probably be pretty high

435
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:39,090
but at what cost

436
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,380
like right how practical is gonna be to

437
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:46,530
have a knife that you can never shove it

438
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:49,230
I have found that the easiest knives to

439
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:51,060
shove a are ones like these this is not

440
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:54,180
one piece of steel that three that I

441
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:56,240
welcome together in the fort there is a

442
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:59,210
sliver of high carbon steel

443
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,650
and my uh seal on the edges the Maya the

444
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:02,929
steel takes the majority of the impact

445
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:04,670
from work well the high carbon steel is

446
00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:08,480
only used to actually get that beginning

447
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:11,500
cut this is as a result easier to

448
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,500
sharpen and hold much longer

449
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:19,189
so how do you clean your knives yeah I

450
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,420
used on and this bone you should just

451
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:22,700
plate

452
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:24,380
I don't usually clean the handle all

453
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:29,150
that much okay

454
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:34,429
unless it's you know you might want wash

455
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:36,200
it but yeah just by my handles off they

456
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:36,590
can work they can crack bad things can

457
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,160
happen

458
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:44,530
yeah oh if you're buying an antique

459
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:48,110
knife and it is a carbon steel like a

460
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:50,899
Sabatier or an opening out if you leave

461
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:57,500
them wet for I'm not kidding thirty

462
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:59,330
seconds you can watch it rust yeah that

463
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,970
black stuff on the outside of that knife

464
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:03,590
is actually also type of rust it only

465
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:07,370
forms at very high temperatures it's

466
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:09,580
harder than steel itself and its really

467
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:14,590
annoying to get off

468
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:16,509
how do you have to get that all well Pat

469
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:19,720
stone right there rustling yeah yeah

470
00:25:16,509 --> 00:25:25,809
this this green stone is a really low

471
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:29,679
crit so for that one my high school will

472
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:31,330
actually have a program where we had to

473
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,019
do some sort of project a service

474
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:38,309
project to finish graduate I went all

475
00:25:35,019 --> 00:25:38,309
trip and you see them and they this man

476
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:47,080
like everyone else is doing like you

477
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,850
know aquatic research and climbing the

478
00:25:47,080 --> 00:26:02,499
Himalayas stuff like that and I was just

479
00:25:48,850 --> 00:26:04,570
like yeah classical knives that are made

480
00:26:02,499 --> 00:26:07,289
out of carbon steel and they will hold

481
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:07,289
an edge longer

482
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:16,440
oil for the handles it really doesn't

483
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:20,610
need to do that complex

484
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:24,060
I used to use olive oil to fix my

485
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:26,310
handles I think that was I have now

486
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:29,190
swapped to tung oil which you can get on

487
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:33,060
Amazon for like six bucks a bottle and

488
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:37,560
you can refinish forty or fifty knives

489
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:40,139
of all its greats no no yeah it's mostly

490
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:42,060
used for finishing pine boards it's like

491
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:50,970
its food safe it's all natural it's just

492
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:55,800
it makes the know that my knifes right

493
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:57,300
there I sand it up to 2,000 for it and

494
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:00,090
then finished it with that tomahawk

495
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:02,940
mm-hm and the result is just sort of a

496
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:04,560
silky feeling it's almost got a little

497
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:07,890
bit of a tap to that to where you can

498
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:10,200
feel like it wants to yeah it's easy to

499
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:11,940
hold on to where you think when when you

500
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:16,860
say I put oil on something you think

501
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:19,470
it's gonna be yes yeah now the oil tung

502
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:20,250
oil takes a couple of hours or days to

503
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,720
dry

504
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:24,900
depending on how many years you do I

505
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:27,350
unit like one or two that's good I'm

506
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,350
just trying to

507
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:34,490
a crane and the handle and it just makes

508
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,490
a whole lot prettier

509
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:57,720
cleavers you can use them just make sure

510
00:27:46,230 --> 00:28:00,600
they're sharp yeah not absent like

511
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:07,080
sharpening it's a lot of fun takes

512
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:08,459
practice my hands are so messed up at

513
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:18,659
this point I can't use finger print

514
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:20,610

the dishwasher

522
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:04,740
I remember this guy somebody used his

523
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:07,740
knife to cooking he wasn't

524

525
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:13,409
rustic it was so rusty and was swimming

526
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:17,700

00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:22,260
dishwasher yeah if you were to take you

don't want these knives and put them in

530
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,940
the dishwasher they would be completely

531
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:36,120
and you end up having to sit there

532
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,919
yes yeah with a little tiny piece of

533
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:45,000
sandpaper your fingers from black their

534
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:48,899
clothes are all black steel gets damaged

535
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:54,120
yeah that that rust is a later coming

536
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:55,408
off exactly so you're taking off the top

537
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:59,330
layer where everything is shiny and

538
00:29:55,409 --> 00:29:59,330
great beautiful and turning into garbage

539
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:09,629
I sell the knives

540
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,010
I bought these stones from a website

541
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:16,350
called Koren

542
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:21,169
ko Rin it's fantastic these are by far

543
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:23,939
the best ones I've ever used they

544
00:30:21,169 --> 00:30:25,830
reasonably priced you're not going to be

545
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:30,120
breaking your wallet getting a couple of

546
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:32,610
these and they will last forever if you

547
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,989
take care of them properly so let them

548
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:34,469
air dry before you put them back in the

549
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:39,299
box

550
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:42,559
yeah so before you use them the Huayra

551
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:45,389
grits don't soak them in water before

552
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:48,980
like when you get up to 6,000 7,000

553
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:48,980
8,000 the stones to war

554
00:30:49,339 --> 00:30:58,619
so water over the top yeah if we could

555
00:30:56,249 --> 00:31:00,419
get stung how many different ones can

556
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:01,099
you say would be a good number to start

557
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:03,809
with

558
00:31:01,099 --> 00:31:06,210
for most people I would say one or two

559
00:31:03,809 --> 00:31:08,129
it's funny okay I'm doing stuff that

560
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:11,339

561
00:31:08,129 --> 00:31:13,529
I'm making the edges so need something

562
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:16,619
you're like little like this if you get

563
00:31:13,529 --> 00:31:19,469
a thousand grip stung you should be set

564
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:21,149
for catching mice yes yeah okay yeah

565
00:31:19,469 --> 00:31:23,279
it's a mid-range zone

566
00:31:21,149 --> 00:31:30,228
it won't be too expensive it should be

567
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:30,229
50 bucks yeah

568
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:40,669
