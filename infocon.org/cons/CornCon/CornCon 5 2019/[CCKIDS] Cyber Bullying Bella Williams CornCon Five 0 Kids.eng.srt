Instagram is what our content places

62
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,900
since they make it easy

63
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:48,099
they also use text instant messages and

64
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:52,029

how to deal with cyberbullying

85
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:46,430
don't you trust if the pony is calling

86
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:50,390
or texting you talking about on your

87
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:52,520
phone you can mark that emerges as BAM

88
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:59,630
so that message she goes to that P to

89
00:08:52,520 --> 00:09:02,000
the trash and if they are in a

90
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,990
particular game or AB switch to a

91
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,660
different one

92
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:08,839
they don't tell anyone that my turn to

93
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:13,189
believe in games and apps you can also

94
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:15,260
important to them only to the people who

95
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:18,830
warn them which may give the bully

96
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:23,750
bandit if it is just you should report

97
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:26,540
to the police I hope an experiment by

98
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:30,040
those kids no one should be afraid of

99
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:33,329
