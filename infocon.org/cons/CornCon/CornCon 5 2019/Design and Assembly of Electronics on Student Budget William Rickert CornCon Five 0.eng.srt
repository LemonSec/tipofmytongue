1
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:24,660
excuse to be talking about the design

2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:27,330
assembly budget alright

3
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,820
hi I'm Lilly breaker as it says up there

4
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,500
I am talking about design of assembly of

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,890
circuit boards that a budget team the

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,820
student can justify so let's get started

7
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:41,969
I said I really Rickards and Who am I I

8
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,950
am a veteran that father of three junior

9
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:46,559
at Iowa State University studying

10
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,469
Computer Engineering and I am a member

11
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,890
of the ice age community that is a cyber

12
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:54,390
defense organization at Iowa State and I

13
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,680
built more than eight hundred circuit

14
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,469
boards in the basement of my apartment

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,899
complex that's my twitter handle i

16
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:02,550
usually talk a lot about design the

17
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:07,560
building electronics how you can do it

18
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:09,479
cheaply interesting projects so here's

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,689
why I'm giving this talk we are at a

20
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:15,000
fantastic time for DIY electronics it is

21
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:17,399
out of price point where it is you can

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,630
have a fail-fast mentality you can make

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,200
whatever you want throw it at the wall

24
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:24,000
but doesn't work who care move on The

25
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,340
Bachelor community is getting to be

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,200
really big so it's supporting a lot of

27
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,490
creativity a lot of really fun stuff

28
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,960
right and also one of my big mottos is I

29
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,360
love working with things I get people to

30
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:41,100
hammer its disobedient there's some good

31
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:43,320
forces for you so what this talk is I'm

32
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,669
giving a brief overview on everything

33
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,559
you need to know to build your own

34
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,829
circuit boards and how to build out how

35
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,600
to design and build them and it's

36
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:55,169
basically I'm calling it a speedrun

37
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,440
tutorial what this talk is not it is a

38
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,600
in-depth tutorial on how to

39
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,610
any step along the way there are better

40
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,860
people than I that have very in-depth

41
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:07,270
very well-made tutorials out there and I

42
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,270
implore you to reach out and find those

43
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:13,220
so the way things used to be with

44
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,960
printed circuit boards is I was a part

45
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,120
of a Twitter conversation that started

46
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,010
this for me so this gentleman here is a

47
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,160
high level engineer and he was talking

48
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:23,840
about some years ago it was $100 for 100

49
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,900
millimeter by 100 millimeter printed

50
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,140
circuit board and Dave Jones from the

51
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:32,600
eevblog pillar chimed in that that was

52
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:35,690
very cheap even ten years before that so

53
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:38,859
17 years ago you'd pay upwards of $500

54
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:43,670
just to start and then tooling prices

55
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:45,770
these days you have not that at all so

56
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,549
on the left here this is oh Sh Park they

57
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:51,020
are one of the big stateside inexpensive

58
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:52,640
manufacturers and what they do is really

59
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,740
clever they will take a whole bunch of

60
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,510
designs concatenate them onto one board

61
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,310
and then send that to stateside

62
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:01,370
manufacturers so that you save a lot of

63
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:04,100
money these other two here are Chinese

64
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,840
manufacturers you can get ten circuit

65
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,299
boards from them up to 100 millimeters

66
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,300
500 millimeters for five dollars and

67
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:13,340
seventeen dollars to ship it in two days

68
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:16,459
so it was in a week you can have ten

69
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,140
circuit boards for about 20 bucks you

70
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:19,700
know obviously you're going to get

71
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,070
better customer support with oh Sh

72
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:27,738
parking but the customer service isn't

73
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:29,239
too bad Chinese manufacturers important

74
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:31,370
turns to know that I'll be repeating a

75
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:35,450
lot first one it is printed circuit

76
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:38,989
boards PCBs silkscreen and edge cuts are

77
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:40,760
two parts of PCB they are the image

78
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:43,850
that's on top usually in white for

79
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,440
silkscreen and edge cuts is the outline

80
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:47,329
of the board that they will cut they

81
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,930
will route in order to separate it from

82
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:52,760
the larger panel the footprint is the

83
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:55,160
physical layout on the circuit board

84
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,859
where your part will sit on I'll have a

85
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,990
better visual

86
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:02,610
here in a couple of slides to explain a

87
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:04,920
little more so as an overview of the

88
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:07,710
process so what you're inducing I start

89
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,630
by writing some piece of the art you

90
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:12,300
will then find whatever components you

91
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:15,359
want to use and your design you'll

92
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:18,180
create the schematic apply footprints

93
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,060
do the PCB layout so actually lay them

94
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:25,860
out as you want them on the board

95
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:28,950
assemble it do something and drop it or

96
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:32,850
I'll be alright so step one is optional

97
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:34,530
you want to do PCB or so this is these

98
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,590
are all examples that I have worked with

99
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:39,000
for a batch life movie but even if

100
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,710
you're not interested Bachelet this is

101
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
still very useful to do because if

102
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,280
you're working that project and you want

103
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,200
to fit it in your closure you can start

104
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,599
with this step created to the exact

105
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,580
right size in a graphic arts program and

106
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,780
then you move forward so it's still very

107
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:56,280
applicable so figured we're at corn con

108
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,229
I would stamp you guys through the

109
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,090
process of making a corn related badge

110
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,880
why not be fun

111
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,929
so what I usually do and if I'm just

112
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,969
making something generic

113
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,040
I will go to Google and research and

114
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:10,770
they have this lovely option you go to

115
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,780
tools and then line drawing so you it

116
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,780
will give you straight up like blend

117
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,309
drugs these are ready-made for badness

118
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:19,340
so it's like whatever image you want I

119
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,750
think I won't leave this guy here and

120
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:26,640
download it make sure you got the rights

121
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:30,330
to use it and import it into kike this

122
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:32,460
Pope imported into e state so there is a

123
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,430
lovely extension for any state it's

124
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:39,690
called SPG

125
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:41,940
shinsen and this is a very creaky

126
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:44,100
program if you lean on it it makes weird

127
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:47,280
noises but it works fantastic when it

128
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:50,010
does work so what you do is you import

129
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,349
it you go extensions SV cheats of

130
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:54,659
Shenzhen and then if you prepare your

131
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:57,180
document by entering what size you want

132
00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:00,120
to put then you put your circuit board

133
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:02,640
their design in there and you go to your

134
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,620
layer selection menu you'll notice when

135
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,270
it first starts up all your layers that

136
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,150
you might be interested in are labeled

137
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:10,650
disabled those are user ethical fields

138
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:13,320
you just go through and remove the word

139
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:16,739
disabled and they work and on the Y they

140
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:19,490
design that way together so now that you

141
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:22,230
have all your layers you can make the

142
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:25,350
the art itself has a silkscreen layer

143
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:27,270
and then just draw a line around it or

144
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,920
the edge pets layer so they know what

145
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:33,120
you want on it in what shape you want

146
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:36,210
then then you go again to extensions SVG

147
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,090
to shinsen and export export keypad so

148
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:41,580
you tell it where to go what you want to

149
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:43,859
explore that and you can plus with these

150
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,469
but generally don't have to and click

151
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,360
apply

152
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:49,980
so next after you know what you want

153
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,210
your design to look like you need to

154
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,980
figure out what parts you want to have

155
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:55,859
on it and you have a lot of options

156
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:58,680
these days so these first two options

157
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:02,340
here digi-key and magic are stateside

158
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:04,830
electronics ascetics parts warehouses

159
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:09,179
and they are very handy they're quick

160
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:11,010
usually educated especially has a one of

161
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:13,530
their large plants in Minnesota so just

162
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:19,740
standard usps shipping will get here in

163
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:22,200
about two days alternative LCSC is a

164
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,990
Chinese version of that they are very

165
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:28,500
inexpensive however you are paying

166
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:30,870
larger shipping prices sorry and the

167
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,570
last option here Alibaba is a direct

168
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:35,580
Chinese manufacturer connection you can

169
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:37,620
get parts very inexpensive but you can't

170
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,210
bundle them together and you have to

171
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,009
beware

172
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,479
scamp's a lot of times you see inflated

173
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:47,090
specs on a lot of things specifically

174
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:49,520
batteries and other things like that now

175
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,979
it is a lot cheaper to buy in China

176
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:56,049
so this first chip here that I have as

177
00:07:51,979 --> 00:08:02,630
an example is a USB to serial device and

178
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:05,449
it is already a dollar 2300 and the

179
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:08,080
second device here is the CH three-30

180
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:11,449
USB of serial is my favorite part and

181
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,240
even right here for a xxx quantity is 30

182
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:16,130
cents apiece these things are do the

183
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,699
same function but there's a vast

184
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:24,770
difference of price and again down here

185
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:27,470
this is the stm32 of f 42f 0:42

186
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:29,508
microcontroller okay so the same price

187
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:34,789
but here is digi-key in the state's down

188
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:37,550
57 and here is LCSC again 92 cents so

189
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:39,020
it's all trade offs you gotta to decided

190
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:41,809
it's more important to get it

191
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:44,329
inexpensively or to get it quickly it's

192
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:45,529
up to you how long do you have to wait

193
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:47,870
with the order on each other

194
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:49,970
so normally it's DHL so it's two days

195
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:53,089
shipping are you paying a lot of money

196
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:54,920
for that about 17 dollars yeah so it's

197
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:58,370
not as bad as you would think if you go

198
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:00,050
to Alibaba the prices are generally

199
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:03,399
higher there I wonder if it's just

200
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:05,839
because people that are shipping less

201
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:09,950
LCS seen as a fair amount of business so

202
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,690
they get better deals my best guess yeah

203
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:18,020
when I first found LCSC and I went a

204
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:19,520
little overboard so here's the best

205
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,560
thing about electronics these days is

206
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,470
that part manufactures want you to use

207
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,420
their parts so in the data sheets like

208
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:28,700
for example if you're using a software

209
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,890
project you go through you find whatever

210
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,260
example code they have you jam it into

211
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,910
your project and it works well the exact

212
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,160
same thing

213
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:37,689
and electronics so you find whatever

214
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,490
part looks interesting you looked at

215
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:41,020
their data sheet and they just provide

216
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:44,920
here's everything you could possibly

217
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:47,590
need to run this so this is a voltage

218
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:49,329
regulator so on one side you put

219
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:51,190
whatever your battery is decided click

220
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:53,260
microcontroller and you get the right

221
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:57,100
voltage

222
00:09:53,260 --> 00:10:00,100
this one is a stm32 of f0 for to a

223
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,840
microcontroller and they are showing you

224
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,400
everything you can possibly need to hook

225
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,800
up to it so that it just works like you

226
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,780
want it to this is the exact same thing

227
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,359
is an example code you can stash tape

228
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:13,900
this straight into your design and it'll

229
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:17,170
work like you would hope now here's

230
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:18,910
another one this is a Chinese only - ooh

231
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:23,620
but can anyone tell me what they think

232
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:28,060
this might do exactly

233
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:29,620
so schematics or language neutral it

234
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,589
doesn't matter what language you speak

235
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,750
you can still see ok USB here's a chip

236
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:37,060
and use now put I know what your

237
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,700
passengers look like so you just copy

238
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,349
that into your schematic and it works

239
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:43,600
this is my favorite part I used them on

240
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:46,530
the B sides Iowa badge save the price of

241
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,530
$1 per batch

242
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,020
well you have to design your own

243
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,880
schematic so that's the very next step

244
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:59,770
so you can take these reference the

245
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,860
schematics and use them in your own

246
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:04,689
designs so keypads the tool I use is

247
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,090
open-source it's available on all the

248
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:10,060
operating systems and with a key tab

249
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:11,680
there's a tool called easy schema I'm

250
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,569
not sure if that's what it's called it's

251
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,579
not even good consensus on whether this

252
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:19,990
is called keypad or Chi pad so I'm not

253
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:22,210
even gonna touch you schema so this is

254
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:24,040
what the e schema is here and this is a

255
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,570
simple patch here that I have laid out

256
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,370
this is the porn batch that I was

257
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,780
talking about and all of this is

258
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:32,320
reference design so right here I have

259
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:34,329
the USB C port with two resistors that

260
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,080
makes the computer say ok this is just a

261
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:40,330
standard USB 2.0 I have choose a button

262
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,860
in the switch I have the reference

263
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:45,010
design for the microcontroller right

264
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:48,940
here reference design for the voltage

265
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:51,880
regulator a battery a reference design

266
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:53,620
for the battery charger and this is my

267
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,740
only real contribution here in the

268
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,600
middle I wired up some LEDs to resistor

269
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:02,500
that's the only new thing I did

270
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:05,830
everything else is reference designs so

271
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,420
you take these and you take up so all

272
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:10,290
these things on these circuit boards

273
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:13,420
then you have to map them to a footprint

274
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:16,959
now I use this button right here within

275
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:19,479
the east schema and how you find

276
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,340
footprints can be a little bit hairy so

277
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,780
you use the footprint reference from it

278
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:25,360
actually as a starting point

279
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:26,860
did you key and Mauser not a lot of the

280
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,270
route nice reasons why it's nice to use

281
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,330
that is a lot of times they will give

282
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:32,680
you the footprints for the party

283
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:34,120
additionally there are industry standard

284
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,219
footprints that you will frequently find

285
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,830
ok this is a standard thing I'm you just

286
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,570
plug it straight across the worst-case

287
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:43,390
scenario is you have to use the

288
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:45,010
reference from the datasheet to draw out

289
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:48,670
your footprints within another tool

290
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:49,720
within keycap now a little bit better

291
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:52,509
explanation of what

292
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:56,110
Prentiss is here is one of the parts and

293
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:57,850
the footprint is just the part part of

294
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:59,610
the part that actually touches the

295
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:02,230
circuit board and conducts electricity

296
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,910
all we have to worry about is what parts

297
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:08,050
are actually going to touch my circuit

298
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:10,180
morning so you use an acute a footprint

299
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:12,250
assignment window so on the left here is

300
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,949
all the libraries that have footprints

301
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:17,800
within them the center field is a list

302
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:20,019
of all of the schematic symbols that you

303
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,729
have used and you just go down the list

304
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:23,949
and you assign a footprint to every

305
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,149
individual and that's all there is to

306
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:27,370
that

307
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:31,720
ok ok and you click this button to

308
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:33,970
generate a mentalist so then that list

309
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,550
is simply a list of all of the parts

310
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:39,040
within the schematic and what footprint

311
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:40,810
there is and what each line of the

312
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,599
footprint is connected to a total pumps

313
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:45,969
on the circuit board so you take that

314
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,310
and you get to go to your PCB layout

315
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:50,199
this is the part that I really find fun

316
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:52,479
is basically arts and crafts on a

317
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:54,219
computer you know you use your netlist

318
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,769
and you laid out your circuit board so I

319
00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:00,459
have my lovely corn here all that you

320
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:01,899
see here is this bluish is my silkscreen

321
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:04,268
so that will be the art that's on top of

322
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:06,759
it and it's a little hard to see but

323
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:09,220
there's this yellow line here that is my

324
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:12,329
edge cuts where the circuit board would

325
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:14,500
be cut out from the panel so you import

326
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:17,410
you can see the button right here you

327
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,360
click Next and you import all of these

328
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,920
footprints that you assign and keep

329
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,680
caches throws them down right next to it

330
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,809
and all you have to do is then take each

331
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,199
of the vidual part put where you want it

332
00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:31,209
on the board and put wires in between so

333
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,639
here is all my parts laid out roughly

334
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:34,599
where I want them and you connect wires

335
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,160
in between

336
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,500
whenever you click on part of the

337
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,900
footprint kicad will point out okay at

338
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,400
this part you want a liar up here and

339
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,590
you just trace a little larger that's

340
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:47,949
all there is to it

341
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:50,410
here on the right is key cads built in

342
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:52,750
rendering engine to show you what things

343
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:55,810
will look like now I don't generally go

344
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:57,730
through the effort to assign 3d shapes

345
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:59,109
to all the footprints so you can see

346
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,730
some are populate here that looks like

347
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:02,890
this part some are just the raw

348
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,840
footprint but it gives you an idea of

349
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:06,490
how the layout is going to work and what

350
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,770
you need to do to make sure that nothing

351
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:10,780
bumps into each other I've previously

352
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:12,069
build a board that was impossible to put

353
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:14,410
a battery of to because I can pay

354
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:17,920
attention to that and there was a things

355
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:20,160
on either side oh well as if it failed

356
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,160
fast

357
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:31,680
and that's what I had to end up do I

358
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:33,480
just didn't realize it at first so once

359
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,589
you're happy with that you need to go to

360
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:39,630
the plot dialog within detail and what

361
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:41,580
this is will generate what's called a

362
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:43,680
Gerber file the Gerber file is an

363
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,420
industry standard way of laying out

364
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,400
certain reports so that manufacturers

365
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,890
know okay this is how you want you're

366
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:52,110
going to be the manufacturer will tell

367
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:54,360
you an excruciating detail what settings

368
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:56,940
need to use to make this work

369
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,550
but I very rarely come across the

370
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,900
situation where I had to edit these so

371
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:03,150
you just generally go with whatever

372
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:06,600
defaults are here you save generate

373
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:08,970
drill files and plot that's all you do

374
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,770
you save up the files and you can decide

375
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:12,840
which manufacturer you want to use and

376
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:15,449
send it to them so we have our three

377
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,040
manufacturers again and one thing that I

378
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:20,340
do think makes your life so much easier

379
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:23,459
is I always make sure to buy a stencil I

380
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:26,970
believe we'll be covering that a couple

381
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:30,540
of slides so this is Jael cbcb they are

382
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:32,340
my preferred supplier and it's a little

383
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:35,280
hard to see here here but that says two

384
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:37,560
dollars for five boards plus seventeen

385
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,589
dollars to ship it to you in a week so

386
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,910
our little corn cob badge

387
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:43,130
20 bucks it's pretty easy for the

388
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:45,780
circuit board

389
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:48,290
alternatively here is oh Sh Park the

390
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:53,040
stateside supplier they are charging

391
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:55,439
4405 a one thing of note it's just off

392
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,910
the bottom here but you have a several

393
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,210
different color options so you can go

394
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:04,409
with green black blue red or yellow

395
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:06,240
certain ports oh Sh Park only does

396
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:07,829
perfect but they do have a better

397
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,490
customer support and they're built in

398
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:12,500
rendering engine is way nicer

399
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:14,720
times even if I just want check a design

400
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:19,880
I use that render engine to make sure

401
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:22,640
that what I'm doing is right now a brief

402
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,110
note about stencils I'll cover these of

403
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,809
stencil here in just a couple of slides

404
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:29,350
but you order them through the same

405
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:31,850
website the order your circle for me and

406
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:33,889
what you can see here is the stencils

407
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:37,010
are relatively cheap between 7 and 13

408
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:39,170
dollars suspenseful and there are clever

409
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:41,210
ways to make it even cheaper so there

410
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:43,640
are open source programs in this case

411
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,500
this is herb V and you can actually

412
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,929
combine stencils together so I have

413
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:50,450
actually four different designs all

414
00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:52,460
right here next to each other and I have

415
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:54,440
one essential at home that I have 10

416
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:57,940
different designs on so that's a 70 cent

417
00:17:54,440 --> 00:18:01,280
per project to make my life much easier

418
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:04,880
I haven't covered yet it's a bit out of

419
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:07,070
order because yeah basically so that you

420
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,590
can read order without some of this

421
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:12,649
setup work well here's a stencil right

422
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:14,990
here and all it is is a sheet of metal

423
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:16,370
where they have laser matched all the

424
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:18,170
parts that were that you want to apply

425
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:21,320
it's solder paste so that you can solder

426
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:23,420
to so in one go you can apply all the

427
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,760
solder to your entire circuit board and

428
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:28,429
it makes it's how you do a large-scale

429
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,780
assembly and even with one or two off

430
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:35,690
designs this makes it way easier

431
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:37,190
so obviously what you'll need for this

432
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:39,620
step is the circuit boards that you've

433
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:42,230
just designed a stencil the parts you

434
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:45,979
want to use solder paste tweezers and

435
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:46,759
isopropyl alcohol this is all the parts

436
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:51,739
that I took

437
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:53,959
this year so I gotta show you this is

438
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:59,089
our stencil this is a circuit board

439
00:18:53,959 --> 00:19:01,399
under test so what you will do is you'll

440
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:04,309
use your stencil as a guide to apply

441
00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:07,309
solder paste solder paste as you can see

442
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:10,219
here are microscopic little balls of

443
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:11,570
solder in a flux solution so instead of

444
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:14,089
soldering the old way where you have an

445
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:17,089
iron you apply solder this you apply the

446
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:19,849
solder the solder paste and it just sits

447
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:21,529
there now the really cool thing about

448
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:25,129
solder paste is that it's slightly

449
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:26,719
sticky so then when you apply when you

450
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:29,678
place your parts on top of the solder

451
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:31,940
paste they stay put

452
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,249
additionally you don't have to worry too

453
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:36,829
much about alignment solder paste once

454
00:19:34,249 --> 00:19:38,749
it turns liquid has surface tension that

455
00:19:36,829 --> 00:19:41,329
will actually pull your parts into place

456
00:19:38,749 --> 00:19:43,669
and a fixed effect so this is a very

457
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:47,959
forgiving process this in my opinion is

458
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:49,699
easier than pants I think one thing

459
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:51,649
that's really important to note is that

460
00:19:49,699 --> 00:19:54,679
there are two different types of solder

461
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:56,268
paste let it and let free let it taste

462
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:58,369
lower temperatures and it's more

463
00:19:56,269 --> 00:20:01,519
forgiving and it's easier to use however

464
00:19:58,369 --> 00:20:03,799
it is very toxic I have small children

465
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:06,769
at home so I think a lot of options I

466
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:10,039
wear gloves wash your hands wear a

467
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:11,899
respirator and get quarterly blood tests

468
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:14,239
for everyone in my house because let

469
00:20:11,899 --> 00:20:17,359
this very nasty thing so be very aware

470
00:20:14,239 --> 00:20:23,109
of that you might like that much better

471
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:26,359
to go throw my huh yeah I like my kids

472
00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:28,489
so you can see here at solder place so

473
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:30,259
what you do is you take your circuit

474
00:20:28,489 --> 00:20:32,389
board you put your stencil on top of it

475
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:34,429
and you apply some solder paste to it

476
00:20:32,389 --> 00:20:36,289
and just use a squeegee credit card or

477
00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:39,139
something similar to scrape along the

478
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:41,899
stencil so the idea is you only leave

479
00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:43,579
spent solder paste in a places where

480
00:20:41,899 --> 00:20:45,768
there is metal on your circ important

481
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:47,599
and you only want to leave about the

482
00:20:45,769 --> 00:20:50,359
thickness of the stencils worth of

483
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:52,990
solder paste there so you can see here

484
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:56,710
this is a very whoever did

485
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:58,360
not like nature did a very nice job you

486
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:01,120
don't need to be this mean necessarily

487
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:03,669
you should scrub out strive for it but

488
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,879
if you happen to be short it's fine

489
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:08,470
it'll it'll take care of it on its own

490
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,840
so once you have your solder paste there

491
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:13,420
you place your components on top of the

492
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:15,220
solder paste and there's our base is

493
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:19,390
slightly sticky so things generally stay

494
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:20,800
put it makes it very easy and this is

495
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:23,470
actually the part of the theme in slides

496
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:28,990
I love that after I reloaded you can see

497
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:31,120
it makes a very neat result so once you

498
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:33,940
have your circuit board your solder

499
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,189
paste and your parts all in one place

500
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:38,350
what you want to do is you want to heat

501
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:40,929
up your circuit board following this

502
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:45,490
reflow curve this is from the data sheet

503
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:46,990
for the solder solder paste and so what

504
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:50,380
you want to do is as quickly as possible

505
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:53,620
come up 200 degrees Celsius then slowly

506
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:56,080
and bring yourself up to 150 degrees

507
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:58,300
Celsius and then again probably about as

508
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,129
fast as you can bring it up to 235

509
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:03,990
degree Celsius hold there for a brief

510
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:06,670
time and allow it to cool off this is

511
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:09,190
ideal circumstances you'll have the best

512
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:10,120
yield of products if you follow this as

513
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,490
best you can

514
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,860
however it is somewhat forgiving you

515
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:17,980
don't need to follow this but you can

516
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:21,790
you should you should if you can't even

517
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:26,200
better so this is how I've been building

518
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:29,260
most of my boards this is a toaster oven

519
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:34,390
$100 Panasonic toaster oven from Walmart

520
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:36,520
and I bought this just before I about

521
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:39,520
two weeks before besides Iowa when I had

522
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,590
three hundred badges to the University

523
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,620
said no you cannot borrow our reflow

524
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:47,020
oven so I appendix when to Walmart and

525
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,580
bought this guy and this is actually

526
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,420
pretty simple all you do is buy

527
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:53,360
basically

528
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:56,840
pull it apart increase the insulation if

529
00:22:53,360 --> 00:23:00,139
you can yank out the reflux or the

530
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:02,919
controller and provide your own there

531
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:06,170
are kits online that make very nice

532
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:09,050
reflow controllers but you don't need it

533
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:11,630
this is besides I have a batch or any

534
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:14,120
microcontroller work I have a

535
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:16,640
temperature sensor here and a little

536
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,850
display actually I should say this is a

537
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,980
thermocouple reader and then you can see

538
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:23,540
this braided wire going off that just is

539
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:27,370
a thermocouple that goes right to the

540
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:30,260
toaster oven this is all about $20

541
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:34,610
doesn't take a lot however I did find

542
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:39,020
out there's a problem they said it has

543
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:41,419
an overflow bug if you take it above 472

544
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:43,400
degrees Fahrenheit it will overflow and

545
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,740
think it's 32 degrees fahrenheit inside

546
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,750
in which case your control oh say oh my

547
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:50,540
god the temperatures too low and turn it

548
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:52,340
on max for as long as I can I turned

549
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:57,830
around and there was a small fire in my

550
00:23:52,340 --> 00:24:00,290
basement my wife was not to be used so

551
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:03,350
with that the code is available on my

552
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:06,230
github if you're interested I did fix

553
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:07,520
that bug it has to deal with how the

554
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:11,960
two's-complement

555
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:14,900
were converging worked but that was an

556
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:17,210
entertaining evening so what you can see

557
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,340
here is one of my initial test runs with

558
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:21,110
the toaster oven setup I have a it's

559
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:26,330
hard to see that's the curve trying to

560
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:29,510
follow and just a USB serial shell it

561
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:31,100
was very trivial you can imagine my

562
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,530
surprise with a few months later I found

563
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,610
that there's an even easier option

564
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:36,530
instead of going through and building

565
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:39,290
your own controller and beefing up your

566
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:44,660
oven you can buy the cheapest skillet at

567
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:47,540
Walmart for $20 now when I bought this I

568
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:50,169
thought I'd be clever and I hooked up my

569
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:53,418
reflow controller in it and I set up

570
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:55,099
it's almost infuriating how perfectly

571
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:58,789
this thing that follows a regular girl

572
00:24:55,099 --> 00:25:01,999
just on its own like my addition helped

573
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:04,489
nothing so all you do so we again have

574
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:07,519
our assembly of circuit boards solder

575
00:25:04,489 --> 00:25:09,950
paste and parts you place it the wrong

576
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:12,499
way you place it here on the skillet

577
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:13,999
crank it up to max and sit there for

578
00:25:12,499 --> 00:25:16,700
three minutes and twenty seconds until

579
00:25:13,999 --> 00:25:18,529
you see silver solder and you turn it

580
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:23,570
off and that is literally all you have

581
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:25,729
to do I built 600 certain ports for Def

582
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:29,089
Con that I sold the DEF CON using this

583
00:25:25,729 --> 00:25:45,229
method it is trivially easy anyone can

584
00:25:29,089 --> 00:25:46,908
do this the bachelor community on

585
00:25:45,229 --> 00:25:50,989
Twitter said hey this works I was like

586
00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:55,249
okay I gotta try that at campster on

587
00:25:50,989 --> 00:25:57,219
twitter is really good guy so yeah that

588
00:25:55,249 --> 00:25:59,299
was my addition it did not help

589
00:25:57,219 --> 00:26:03,229
additional tools that are somewhat

590
00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:06,679
useful here is a Hello

591
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:08,869
so a hot air rework station this allows

592
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:10,429
you to do spot fixes and do little

593
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:13,099
soldering jobs that would be hard to do

594
00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:15,019
with a soldering iron I have done BGA's

595
00:26:13,099 --> 00:26:16,609
which are parts that have all of the

596
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:19,639
connections hidden underneath the chips

597
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:22,879
with just one of these $39.00 gives you

598
00:26:19,639 --> 00:26:24,168
a lot of flexibility these little

599
00:26:22,879 --> 00:26:28,939
dispenser bottles have been invaluable

600
00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:30,589
for isopropyl alcohol you just pump on a

601
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,979
couple times with the red you're good to

602
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,859
go

603
00:26:30,979 --> 00:26:36,889
well tweezer kit these are all optional

604
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:37,999
if you're interested there's this every

605
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:40,218
part of this process has been

606
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:42,109
significantly cheaper than I expected

607
00:26:40,219 --> 00:26:45,309
so it's really fun to be able to show

608
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:45,309
what are you doing

609
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:50,529
little pom-poms and there's a little cup

610
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:52,570
on top when you press down on it the cup

611
00:26:50,529 --> 00:26:54,820
is filled up with whatever is in the

612
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:57,520
bottle there for makeup but if they work

613
00:26:54,820 --> 00:27:00,189
perfectly for this get rid of the flux

614
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,679
okay yep oh sorry I have misunderstood

615
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:05,649
do a gallon you can usually get over in

616
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:06,730
flux I use it a lot to clean up stencils

617
00:27:05,649 --> 00:27:08,199
after I've used them because you don't

618
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:10,450
want to read it you'll have a little

619
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,460
leftover solder paste and so you get bad

620
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:14,610
applications so you need to clean with

621
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,610
that

622
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:21,939
so our final total from our corner badge

623
00:27:19,149 --> 00:27:24,158
so intense printed circuit boards is

624
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:27,399
five dollars one stencil with seven

625
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,799
dollars the parts 410 or 1725 I have

626
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:34,209
that right here shipping from China was

627
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:36,610
seventeen dollars man missed the point

628
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:39,070
uh the reason why LCSC

629
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:41,649
is my favorite part supplier in China is

630
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:43,570
because their sister company is jlc PCB

631
00:27:41,649 --> 00:27:45,459
so you can order your circuit boards and

632
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:47,260
your parts from the same place and have

633
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:50,409
them shipped together so you're only

634
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:52,600
paying one shipping charge your solder

635
00:27:50,409 --> 00:27:55,390
paste from Amazon it's all of eleven

636
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:58,090
dollars the Walmart griddle twenty

637
00:27:55,390 --> 00:28:00,190
dollars so the total for making ten

638
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:03,730
badges with no supplies starting

639
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:05,380
whatsoever is $77 46 if you don't count

640
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:08,559
the griddle and solder faces you can

641
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:10,450
reuse those the solder paste it comes in

642
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:14,710
a little - you'll get more than ten

643
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:16,919
patches worth out of that these are some

644
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:18,880
of these badges that I have worked on

645
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:22,149
well some of the circuit boards that

646
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:26,710
we've done and stm32f4 t2 test board of

647
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:28,570
the battery sa OS and totems and a

648
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:32,590
little DEFCON machen didn't quite make

649
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:33,879
on this year you breadboard these before

650
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:42,699
you actually

651
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:47,230
not anymore now there is a clear back

652
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:51,640
here one of my splash screens I put New

653
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:54,960
York this Casey Stark is that Casey at

654
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:57,760
DEFCON second case Eve party at DEFCON

655
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,430
uses a two transistor arrangement to

656
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,440
blink Bala native rapport but these days

657
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:05,020
I rarely breadboard eyelids and just

658
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:07,780
making sure of sanity checking

659
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:10,060
I don't do parkour ball well so ever

660
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:12,010
circuit boards are so easy and cheap

661
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:14,740
that I'll just make extra ones

662
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:17,800
I ordered circuit boards and notice that

663
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:20,380
there were small issues with them one

664
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,060
fun thing about JSC PCB is until it's

665
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:24,130
chips you can add things to the order

666
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,240
so I found a version wanted my circuit

667
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,740
board there and notice there's new

668
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,410
shooters to put order the version two

669
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:32,400
and they both ship together I'm out $5

670
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:32,400
oh well

671
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:39,140
and back to where we were

672
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:48,800
here we go okay this is a Raspberry Pi

673
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:52,160
can shoot module Devonport that i've

674
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,690
made up little board the test a pure

675
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:57,440
Chinese and chip that I never got

676
00:29:53,690 --> 00:30:00,020
working this is a if you've seen the

677
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,970
rubber duckies this is my brief number

678
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:05,620
under ducky this is a this whole

679
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:08,360
assembly here is a dollar twenty six

680
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:13,219
circuit board that set that case and all

681
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:14,899
I did besides I will match and this is a

682
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:18,710
bluetooth laser tag

683
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:20,150
damn that I was playing with alright

684
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:22,010
thank you guys for having me I've lasted

685
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:23,390
through that because last talk went a

686
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:26,750
bit long I wanted to make sure we get to

687
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:28,429
the closing ceremony this is my hub all

688
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:31,220
of my designs are open-source and they

689
00:30:28,429 --> 00:30:32,750
are available there this is my Twitter I

690
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:35,809
am constantly talking about circuit

691
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:38,059
boards and fun projects hopefully

692
00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:47,360
they'll have this available after all is

693
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:49,220
there any questions I've never

694
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,809
encountered it that used to be a thing

695
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:55,670
that happened in the past when I pulled

696
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:57,830
but everything is computer controlled so

697
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:58,760
I've never seen a mistake I've seen a

698
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:01,580
lot of mistakes that I've made

699
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:05,960
replicated that part and I've had a lot

700
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:09,050
of machine translated emails from

701
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:11,210
Chinese suppliers saying you know all

702
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:16,700
the best English trying to get something

703
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:19,500
clarified it happens items here using

704
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:21,930
key cap is there a reason you use

705
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:24,570
is that her say like eagle or legally

706
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:26,520
get to pay for I'm a college student all

707
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:29,159
this is done on the finished shoestring

708
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:31,139
I can manage people is freedom hey

709
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,970
Jackie hi how was it I have with

710
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:36,240
chocolate since I wasn't aware that yeah

711
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:38,100
the only for a working pump oh okay it's

712
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,590
free for even higher ed you just can't

713
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:43,219
use it for a commercial product ah I

714
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:46,110
guess I'm kind of over that line though

715
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:48,000
yeah I don't know I try to stick towards

716
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:49,290
all the source and I only use Linux but

717
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,090
that's if you make money but you could

718
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:54,780
have County your trip to Def Con as part

719
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:56,580
of your expenses and your loss yeah that

720
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:59,820
did it all the other that's our exile

721
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:01,590
again that season yeah I need to sit

722
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:03,659
down learn few Jing's I want start doing

723
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:05,520
three American enclosures for projects

724
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:07,530
yeah because they are really cool things

725
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,270
happening there in fact like community

726
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:11,040
so you said you don't do like for your

727
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:12,690
design since they're relatively

728
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,220
off-the-shelf reference stuff you don't

729
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:16,820
get anyway

730
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:18,679
verification spice or so I did it not

731
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,908
starting to have to do that this when I

732
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:21,530
definitely do have to do that as I

733
00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:25,880
figured for some of the stuff but timing

734
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:28,370
yeah yeah absolutely I did not do the

735
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,659
picture but yet so this is a laser tag

736
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:33,320
system that I was using an infrared

737
00:32:29,659 --> 00:32:36,710
signal with my own encoding to transfer

738
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:38,270
user IDs as this shot right and I had

739
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:40,210
enough of the GBA wired up to the second

740
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:43,668
that I was having all sorts of crazy

741
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:44,780
problems with so yeah as a junior I'm

742
00:32:43,669 --> 00:32:46,220
starting to get to the classes where

743
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,049
they normally teach that yeah

744
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:50,690
and that's a lot of fun really a joint

745
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:54,230
school right now yeah what is it you're

746
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:56,480
a EE major computer II computer yep and

747
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:58,190
I never looked at any of the art stuff

748
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,360
that they're doing now I've actually got

749
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:01,880
some students that are interested in

750
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:04,309
like either to do some sensitive and

751
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,590
stenciling more like ancient rattling

752
00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:08,629
across oh yes I've heard about some of

753
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:11,120
that I don't know if they have anywhere

754
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:13,090
he hasn't done in k-12 yet obviously but

755
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,520
yeah I mean you would get the college's

756
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:19,879
for together I just saw a paper about

757
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:21,620
that doing an additional ink jetting for

758
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:25,010
a second layer yeah wouldn't it be cool

759
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:26,629
for art that really would be yeah I'm a

760
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:28,850
little biased I'm part of the reason why

761
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:31,460
I really love badge life is that you are

762
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:34,219
strictly limited to what you have and

763
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:36,110
you can add too many colors might muddle

764
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,580
a zone but the neat thing I found of

765
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:40,979
students have found that if they leave

766
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:43,240
copper on purpose but not have a

767
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:45,280
Electrical you can actually make a

768
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,690
darker color absolutely right so you can

769
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,850
play with half columns and you can do

770
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:51,070
some relief yeah thank you which one did

771
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:53,350
you take the death penalty so all of

772
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:55,600
these here in the middle are definitely

773
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:58,000
okay yeah I couldn't remember I saw you

774
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,280
were not I only have a relatively

775
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,760
limited I was there as part of the bad

776
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:05,470
pirates sect AC group yeah and so I

777
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,640
worked on some of their designs I only

778
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:08,110
really felt just some of the battery

779
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,090
stuff on their badge where you would

780
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:11,770
like the hardware hacking village only a

781
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:20,860
little bit yeah I was trying to sell

782
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:22,330
things Intel was not generally possible

783
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:24,340
that's what we were just talking about

784
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:26,168
so there is some new stuff here where

785
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:29,169
you can get a second snow screen but

786
00:34:26,168 --> 00:34:31,509
it's not generally available yet there

787
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:34,418
was one guy found that I have it in his

788
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:36,790
boards were $70 piece to have that

789
00:34:34,418 --> 00:34:42,609
option so it's starting to become a

790
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:46,029
thing that it's not feasible yet so

791
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:48,190
these are si OS so they you can see this

792
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:51,730
little header right here SEO is the

793
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:54,970
shitty add-on it's a bad thing and you

794
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:57,640
can make use of this somewhat

795
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:59,350
standardized 6-pin connector to have all

796
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,850
sorts of things to plug into it and do

797
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:02,170
different things so these are two

798
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:08,339
different circuit boards stacked on top

799
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:08,340
of each other the end over here

800
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:14,270
well this was my first talk thank you

801
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,270
guys for having me out a lot
