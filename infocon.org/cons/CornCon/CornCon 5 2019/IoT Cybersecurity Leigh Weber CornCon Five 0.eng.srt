1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:09,059
poor communicator my bad well I got it

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:19,310
so let's go around the table

3
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:19,310
this one pointing here we do like that

4
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,660
it works

5
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:42,080
okay next tidy IT for Court Services

6
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:45,650
Court Services I do I team for the night

7
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:49,220
did you just show up courses I teach

8
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:51,379
computer science here at Edwards Boise

9
00:00:49,220 --> 00:01:01,089
contractor for a little it's a company

10
00:00:51,380 --> 00:01:01,090
or our second guy would know him yes

11
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:12,429
full brush incorporated put that full of

12
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:12,430
Russian corporate apartment

13
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:24,229
so how much your time for the last 18

14
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:27,970
years have you spent doing security by

15
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:27,970
design before he started code again

16
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:35,469
it's

17
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:40,220
okay so did everyone hear that

18
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:44,180
here's guy whose rights ago this being

19
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:45,649
true and he is so typical of ninety-nine

20
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,899
point eight percent of all people who

21
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:49,940
write programs they have a problem that

22
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:51,979
they're fine once all that security is

23
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:56,330
not the warm front of what they do

24
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:59,330
I wrote code exclusively thirty years as

25
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:02,509
a consultant color companies identified

26
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:04,670
what was new tech for them right in the

27
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:07,550
United States I speed trains its new

28
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:09,649
tech but it's going to France

29
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:15,769
something they find operational for for

30
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:18,319
three years the u.s. New France so or

31
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:21,410
wherever you get your customers they all

32
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:29,390
are different placement technology so we

33
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:31,549
focus on on the on the other side so

34
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,000
Internet of Things people know about

35
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:34,610
that

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:43,609
give me some examples from your home or

37
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:47,930
life C matter network camera cameras

38
00:02:43,609 --> 00:02:53,480
what's over Alexa fix the damn

39
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:56,390
presentation else machine severs

40
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,970
machining centers yeah now that's not

41
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,410
something to do at home but I'm sorry

42
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,950
how many of you have a smartphone in

43
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:15,530
your pocket is

44
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:21,018
we belong we can use all that device Pro

45
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:24,799
what we know why not it's not a desktop

46
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:26,389
it's not that's the first yeah I mean

47
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,189
it's it's kind of it

48
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:34,700
so how many of you have driver's license

49
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:38,480
this works okay and deserve a parent my

50
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:40,638
paycheck okay

51
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,388
so how many how many of you who drive a

52
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:47,750
car that's less than ten years old okay

53
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:50,840
what makes that car work how many just

54
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:53,480
as a guess how many in quotes computers

55
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:58,069
earnings identify you I'll give you

56
00:03:53,480 --> 00:04:05,228
choices less than five five to ten and

57
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:08,679
to 20 20 to 30 40 30 so less than five

58
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:08,680
five to ten

59
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,760
hey all the phones in this room could

60
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:22,530
talk to each other each phones its own

61
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:27,270
how many are 10 to 20 okay how many are

62
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:30,570
20 to 30 how many of more than 30 okay

63
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:32,729
ping-ping-ping so imagine that you're

64
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:38,730
running a business locally here and

65
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:41,870
you've got 30 desktops okay what we have

66
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:46,340
to do to protect that nothing or a bunch

67
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:49,500
what do you need to enable 30 desktops

68
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:55,919
infrastructure with woman what would you

69
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:57,420
have to give them if they wanted to give

70
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,770
you each other really leaves

71
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:08,850
infrastructure switches routers networks

72
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:11,190
way to communicate right so we think a

73
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:17,010
lot about stuff in very parochial terms

74
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:19,000
I've got desktop I've got a laptop but

75
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,620
we also really smart phones and most

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,380
phones have more memory storage and

77
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,900
continued capacity than any desktop in

78
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:28,440
our office life is you watch opponent a

79
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,440
new company

80
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:41,030
right but what about the printers what

81
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:44,370
are they are they I go team confronts

82
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:46,380
what about if you're working with those

83
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,930
offices where you need a badge got the

84
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:51,960
badge in what is that stuff

85
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:54,870
what about the sensors that figure out

86
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,210
who they're or not and turn the lights

87
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,740
on and off well the old versions weren't

88
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,180
connected but what about the ones that

89
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,450
recorded into the building engine

90
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:05,370
management system by a team what about

91
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:08,550
the ones that take care of the water

92
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:12,900
would about the battery I I do not know

93
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:14,280
how to use them as I walk over and I'm

94
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,620
looking for something that go like this

95
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,830
and I put my hand there and I pull away

96
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:25,440
water comes out but then I go to put my

97
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:28,590
hand underneath it there so expenses of

98
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,690
my life stay put garlic seed and if

99
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:34,890
someone told you you put it down any

100
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:40,910
goes but you go to someone else's house

101
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:40,909
and you just tap it because back

102
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:52,780
so where is the line between what we

103
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:57,669
have in embedded systems inside the car

104
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,669
and enterprise community

105
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,510
yeah or duty my sister dominated be

106
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,370
addressed

107
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:10,830
they all like there goes yeah we

108
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:14,550
shouldn't have a lot of processing it

109
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:16,409
will be so let us amendment between how

110
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,850
much processing power is there on that

111
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:22,560
little rainy doorbell that as the camera

112
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:29,910
so it's still communicating as though

113
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:32,280
it's IVA team how many do you now have

114
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:36,330
nav systems in your car that have backup

115
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:39,388
cameras but also let you go to serious

116
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:41,990
but you go to Netflix what you go to

117
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:41,990
apps

118
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:51,068
so if I can be in my car or vehicle this

119
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:55,900
is an opportunity and I can get

120
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:58,750
information from the internet the 5%

121
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:00,969
that what's that top 5% there John

122
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:03,819
on the internet that isn't dark it isn't

123
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:07,210
deep its surface its own used so if I

124
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:11,560
can connect to the surface web from my

125
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:14,109
car and now I'm connected to that

126
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:17,080
highway which includes good and bad

127
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:19,870
actors and I have a whole bunch of

128
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,900
things inside my car and I can extend

129
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:25,320
that to my phone and my pony is also

130
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:31,060
cross connected to my house and to work

131
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:33,780
what have you just done look Cleveland

132
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,780
lost control

133
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:39,690
so that's a really complex problem in a

134
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:43,530
really great opportunity to do cyber

135
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:47,820
street you see now all these things that

136
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:51,930
you connect in ways unexpected so now

137
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:55,230
when we're doing security design you

138
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:57,650
don't have to think about all these it's

139
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:00,930
more than a weapon now it's a mesh

140
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:07,740
communication and if you don't do it

141
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:10,620
right you're really miserable this

142
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,600
presentation is a little technical in

143
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,330
cars I'm going to skip through a bunch

144
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:20,660
of it at any time if you see something

145
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:23,490
you want know more about please write I

146
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,350
am done to those people if you think I

147
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:30,540
am one of those people you need to go

148
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:35,120
see than my daughter so you know it's

149
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:35,120
the same stage old cars and

150
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:42,190
animals to open and close the window and

151
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:44,350
ahead extra pedal so that you could

152
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:48,630
shift the transmission that is not the

153
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:50,459
wrong level so what do we have

154
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,689
there's a whole bunch of it

155
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:54,880
entertainment systems I'm the Carly

156
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:57,040
that I mentioned but how many of you

157
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,519
have driven a car that has either

158
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,949
parking assist or Lane holding or

159
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:03,490
warning that someone is approaching you

160
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:06,880
okay

161
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:10,920
so there are dedicated sensors in your

162
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:14,230
park and processing units ECU's

163
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,819
electronic control units that that that

164
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,800
those are dedicated systems they don't

165
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,670
really need to talk to too much else on

166
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,370
the car

167
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:24,040
so there's circuitry for those sensors

168
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:26,910
they process it they figure out the turn

169
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:30,760
the light on and along that belly

170
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:33,100
however if you can wire all those you

171
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,920
would have many extra miles of wire

172
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:41,370
which equates to a lot of extra weight

173
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,370
which equates to much less gas bill and

174
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:48,070
engineers are smart and they built an

175
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:50,829
infrastructure an inside car there's a

176
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:54,610
common transportation I wouldn't you

177
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:57,810
know we use networks and Ethernet inside

178
00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:02,430
of cars then called a canvas

179
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:05,339
and long before there were for some

180
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:08,219
reason in the electronics industry the

181
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:10,589
terminology for network connection is a

182
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,389
bus you used to be able to put voltages

183
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:15,540
on there and that's how instrumentation

184
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:17,819
works so the other thing that is

185
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:20,399
depending on the amount of money you

186
00:11:17,819 --> 00:11:23,849
spend and the teacher said to get at the

187
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:27,629
car even twenty years ago I was doing

188
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:31,230
work for Mercedes actually doing a lot

189
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:34,709
of training and they had anti-skid and

190
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:38,220
if you skimmed antilock systems on on

191
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:40,589
their cars right one helped you on the

192
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:43,259
ice the other one made it so to your

193
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:45,720
vertice hit the brake the wheels would

194
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:49,439
lock which intimates control and what

195
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:52,620
does it do we put his brakes in such a

196
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:55,290
way that you slow down there just don't

197
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,509
escape they had all these different

198
00:11:55,290 --> 00:12:00,269
systems so in the last 20 years there's

199
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:03,509
only to learn more and more of those and

200
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:05,790
if you look at a firm like Tesla that's

201
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:08,689
pushing over-the-air updates up to their

202
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,689
car all the time

203
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:16,760
they are almost added autonomous right

204
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,230
even thicker than Maine has one and we

205
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,930
were driving on the roads to Colorado

206
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:23,800
and he basically took his hands off he

207
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:26,569
turned on all the bells and whistles and

208
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:29,810
except when there was an exit ramp that

209
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:34,180
car track Blaine eating at Delaney and

210
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:35,930
it did automatic adjusted cruise control

211
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:40,969
what is that

212
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:42,650
I want to go 70 miles an hour as I start

213
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:47,570
a sign here and I would have sleepless

214
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:50,600
all night being bad Allen Lane but as I

215
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:52,400
approached another car is a whole other

216
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,200
set of sensors that say you know there's

217
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,610
something in front of us and based on

218
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,340
our current speed the calculated

219
00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:00,260
stopping distance we can't keep going 70

220
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:03,170
because we're going to get within a

221
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:07,100
range that the engineers consider to do

222
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:10,219
not safe so what's it do it drops the

223
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:12,260
speed down even though your desires to

224
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,510
go 70 it drops the speed down so it

225
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:18,530
increases the gap between uniform from

226
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:21,410
that's all peyote Oh team deposits it's

227
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:23,900
in your car it's another grouping of

228
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:26,089
sensors and processors and

229
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:29,630
decision-making that somehow send

230
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:32,090
signals to its sister systems and their

231
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:36,170
vehicle to either give us fuel are

232
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:38,810
actually quite brakes were both why we

233
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:39,769
use the cars example it's almost no

234
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:42,800
different than the

235
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:47,629
a factory where you have a assembly line

236
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:50,050
and you've got you know one line is

237
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:53,269
let's let's do Bob water very simple

238
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:56,329
water comes in as little tiny plastic

239
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:58,610
plugs and in one place those go through

240
00:13:56,329 --> 00:14:00,589
a process and they get blown into a roll

241
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:02,079
so that little thing that's about this

242
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:05,420
big we come to that whole model

243
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:08,238
otherwise we'd have to ship these empty

244
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:10,009
fragile bottles and they'd all crush so

245
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:12,920
the comment is a little piece of almost

246
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:15,170
like a plastic cube it's plumb it goes

247
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,790
goes to the phone station it gets

248
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:19,429
inspected to make sure the bottle is

249
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:20,959
well formed it goes against water but

250
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:22,488
into it has been a whole bunch of

251
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,459
systems that take the water from the

252
00:14:22,489 --> 00:14:27,470
backyard filter it through a whole bunch

253
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:29,929
of filtering processes check that it's

254
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:31,939
clear there's no contaminants all that

255
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:34,040
stuff they put it in goes down to the

256
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:35,779
next station has to get capped and goes

257
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,790
and gets labeled and because of this

258
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:42,860
package all these systems to talk to

259
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:46,309
each other right our job is to make sure

260
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:48,889
our clients stay in control in the

261
00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:51,999
affirmative way of all these

262
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,999
interconnected systems

263
00:14:55,270 --> 00:15:01,870
and help them identify as soon as we can

264
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:09,070
when someone is trying to take control

265
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:13,800
away and then if someone is help them

266
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:13,800
automatically defend and regain control

267
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:24,730
there's a lot of stuff in the car

268
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:26,740
and once you know all this stuff the

269
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:30,070
people who build the cars we call Molly

270
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:32,730
Adams you call them Ford and Chevy

271
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,730
Toyota

272
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:44,260
they are all much business use of this

273
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:46,540
data so

274
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:49,000
this doesn't look very different than

275
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:51,459
what John was talking about in the sense

276
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,630
of the risks it's all about identifying

277
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:57,310
risk same token techniques what do you

278
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:59,250
care about what do you have in these

279
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:01,989
protection

280
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:04,330
how do people attack

281
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:06,910
what kind of detentions can you put in

282
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:12,700
place to make it harder for them to do

283
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:16,709
it and here because you know the

284
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:21,010
examples that do go away Johnny Johnson

285
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:23,410
done so you know in the examples Johnson

286
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:27,069
is using so the most part people just

287
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:31,150
lose money and that gets them upset here

288
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:33,220
you have to potentially lose in life so

289
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:41,230
when you do what we call cyber physical

290
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:43,030
systems the engineers who designed the

291
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:45,840
new build them already think through an

292
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:50,110
awful lot of scenarios and building

293
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:55,440
redundancies or safety settings and when

294
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:55,440
things go wrong they will shut down safe

295
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:59,870
let's let's have an example of an

296
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:04,270
elevator

297
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:04,270
how many of you have fear of elevators

298
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:16,180
people ok for wine in 170 or 160 years

299
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:16,180
of using elevators don't we worry about

300
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:23,720
ok so this gentleman say they have

301
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:28,100
brakes what about those brakes that's

302
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:33,080
important they are completely separate

303
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:36,730
physical system that if anything goes

304
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:42,470
wrong with the elevator they engage and

305
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:45,200
mr. Otis who invented that would go to

306
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:49,070
state fairs and have his elevator and he

307
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,840
would chop the room that was part of the

308
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,610
pulley system to the elevator and they

309
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,439
would drop and was stopped because he

310
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:57,560
had to prove its safety for people with

311
00:17:54,440 --> 00:18:01,490
adopted but it is completely separate

312
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:05,690
system I maybe get on a train or see

313
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:07,340
movies about Germans ok I know it's not

314
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:10,160
too many hands of it up with going in

315
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:13,780
the Train so you're gonna design a train

316
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:18,590
and you're going really really fast and

317
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:22,250
you lose power what do you want to train

318
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:27,470
to want to keep going down the hill or

319
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:29,060
do you want it to break so well your

320
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:30,230
first bill to the trading partners it

321
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,000
you know it's really tough to apply

322
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:33,590
brakes so we're going to put a pneumatic

323
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,190
tube in there and wouldn't we put air

324
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:38,810
pressure in don't we'll apply the brakes

325
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:40,490
and that's a great design until you

326
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:42,240
think about safety I thought it was the

327
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:46,770
absence of

328
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,630
yes okay so the first guy said oh use

329
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:50,910
pressure apply brakes Chris takes a lot

330
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:53,970
of energy and time to keep pressuring

331
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:56,670
them but if you think about safety like

332
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:58,410
you do is you flip it around when

333
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:02,250
everything is operating well and the

334
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:05,550
hoses have no leaks and I have power and

335
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:08,640
I can pressurize it I will set the

336
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:11,909
brakes to off and let it go but anything

337
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:15,270
happens that the pump doesn't work or a

338
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:17,670
line is broken or someone chops chops

339
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:21,389
the cord and you lose pressure the

340
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:25,020
brakes come on that's designing for

341
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:26,730
safety well for cyber we will have to

342
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:29,220
wind up a very often changing the

343
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:31,680
engineers way of thinking of things from

344
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:35,310
the beginning to design cyber security

345
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:38,300
into products from day one because the

346
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:42,360
world we live in today for the most part

347
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:44,280
is the Internet protocols that we use

348
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:47,820
which are still used on some of these

349
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:52,290
cars to talk from the car to the

350
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:55,139
infotainment system to maps to the

351
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:56,790
telematics operators those things were

352
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,610
designed by engineers who were trying to

353
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:03,110
see if they even could get two things to

354
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:03,110
communicate without loss of pain

355
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:12,229
think about okay if I get the data sure

356
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:12,230
should I believe it

357
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:22,140
so I'm car and somehow you get into my

358
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:30,090
systems and you send me a command that's

359
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:36,000
a 30 inch on boom well did the engineers

360
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:38,549
who designed the car say oh we probably

361
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,100
ought to check that turn off the engine

362
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:43,679
switch and make sure we're actually

363
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:48,559
stopped before we allow visually

364
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:52,559
determine if it did maybe they didn't

365
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:54,658
but more importantly those checks might

366
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:57,389
be from systems outside of where you're

367
00:20:54,659 --> 00:21:00,809
able to eject that command so if you're

368
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:02,880
able to find a path to the right part of

369
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:04,549
the network to put in the turn the

370
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,779
engine off

371
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:09,720
it doesn't it may not matter if you're

372
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:13,980
building a mountain bypass that they bit

373
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:15,390
on check because the engineer said well

374
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,340
you know the only path go through there

375
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:19,500
is you have to go through this and we

376
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:22,260
won't even let you turn the key off if a

377
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,970
cars money I don't actually know that's

378
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:26,820
true but they might have tried to build

379
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:30,940
that anyway but if I can

380
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:34,080
Louis ot devices will there anybody Star

381
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:38,140
Trek fan not you people

382
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:44,189
the humans were being attacked by the

383
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:47,050
Borg and much better technology but

384
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:49,720
leave it to the cyborg to save the day

385
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:52,090
the data said oh I found a little

386
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:57,430
protective function Captain Picard

387
00:21:52,090 --> 00:22:00,250
I told the entire four cubes Ghostly and

388
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:05,230
I was like a 19 and it's like a perfect

389
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:08,770
example so if I'm able to get to the

390
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:11,320
entertainment system and from that get

391
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:13,270
information on the internal command

392
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:16,750
control system inside your car and you

393
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:18,580
check commands if it's a well if it's a

394
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:21,550
well addressed command and the command

395
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:26,260
is legitimate the car doesn't say well

396
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:31,960
oh boy who are you to tell me to do that

397
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:35,530
at this moment now what is that all

398
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:38,410
about when you go and log into any of

399
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:43,149
the travel please bank accounts you know

400
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:44,980
your bank's now saying you know we're

401
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:50,110
going to trust the verify you claim to

402
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:52,150
be speaker okay what would speaker set

403
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:53,919
their account speaker say I've got this

404
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:55,780
email address in this phone number I'm

405
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,429
going to send you a request I'm gonna

406
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,410
send you some numbers and if you plug

407
00:22:57,429 --> 00:23:01,690
those numbers in within a certain amount

408
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:03,970
of time and they match the numbers I

409
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:08,040
sent you I'll believe that you are

410
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:10,900
speaker but inside the bus in your car

411
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:14,810
that stuff

412
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:17,830
in fact it's very challenging to build

413
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:22,389
those things in two systems that one

414
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:24,610
devices so have you come up with similar

415
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:28,910
authentication and authorization

416
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:31,330
techniques that's why I have tell me you

417
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,330
can too

418
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:37,940
we only have another few minutes so so

419
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,500
some of these just kind of set up what

420
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,500
you're talking to it you know this

421
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:44,120
beauty 2x thing is as we're moving

422
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:48,280
towards autonomous vehicles there are a

423
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:55,729
lot of your standards being designed but

424
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:58,340
how accurate is your GPS signal have you

425
00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:01,070
ever been standing on a corner and you

426
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:04,699
list your phone and it said you were two

427
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:09,710
blocks away how would you like your car

428
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:11,900
to think that - not favorable huh so

429
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:16,280
that so the drift if you look at the map

430
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:18,770
for cars to be multiple yards 10 12 15

431
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:21,250
feet when you get into places watch

432
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:21,250
steel

433
00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:30,129
like that the drift is terrible so

434
00:24:27,609 --> 00:24:32,320
what's coming is lots of little devices

435
00:24:30,129 --> 00:24:36,580
that are going to go along the roads

436
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:39,939
that people like precise locations IOT

437
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:42,389
devices they plug in between the stand

438
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:45,399
and the light of the street life and

439
00:24:42,389 --> 00:24:48,729
they will tell you where you are within

440
00:24:45,399 --> 00:24:53,049
an inch which they call to the five four

441
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:56,350
centimeters and that stuff's competence

442
00:24:53,049 --> 00:24:58,269
of vehicle to infrastructure but why you

443
00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:01,859
may decide to use that instead of what's

444
00:24:58,269 --> 00:25:05,190
available to the farming community and

445
00:25:01,859 --> 00:25:08,470
lost a wide area augmentation system

446
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:12,509
that's centimeter accuracy is built into

447
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:14,799
existing GPS but what's interesting

448
00:25:12,509 --> 00:25:23,480
agriculture and being inside the city

449
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:26,960
Chicago but it's figured out

450
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:33,580
right but the you know feels and to not

451
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:36,320
have any things that the radiators

452
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:39,260
cities much worse what do you do about

453
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,269
things like I live in Chicago now we

454
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:43,279
have Wacker Drive Billie's when it's

455
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:46,970
called it has lower middle and upper

456
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:48,740
drive and he gets again they're more

457
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:56,200
sensitive receivers higher powered

458
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:56,200
satellites maybe my dad's many more such

459
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:05,360
devices because in general the wall

460
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:07,490
doesn't very often if you use your phone

461
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,580
today there's a feature of the human

462
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:12,110
system turn on the light flag will give

463
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:15,620
you a better position before you know

464
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:19,279
most white light transceivers now will

465
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:24,080
tell you their geolocation so they

466
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:28,350
actually they use that Wi-Fi signal to

467
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:36,449
help normalize the GPS signal Escom

468
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:38,549
better location steps there how many of

469
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:41,870
you have seen the ads for some of the

470
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:44,639
insurance companies one representing

471
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:49,439
where they say well monitor what you're

472
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:51,720
doing okay that monitor do it with a

473
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:55,110
stinking card of the card dealer you

474
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:58,730
know to the left where your left leg is

475
00:26:55,110 --> 00:27:03,090
there's a port there while the OBD port

476
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:05,220
and that's onboard diagnostics and if

477
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:07,649
you plug anything in there please make

478
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:10,409
sure you know working because that

479
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:13,530
device is talking right to the internals

480
00:27:10,409 --> 00:27:15,659
of your car it's not just read only and

481
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:20,129
it's trusted it assumes anything

482
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:21,590
in there is okay that device sends a

483
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:25,830
signal into the car while you're driving

484
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:28,610
to do something unexpected you're the

485
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:28,610
passenger and

486
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:34,120
so a lot of the car hacks we forgot in

487
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:36,340
the fiscal access you how to actually

488
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:38,679
plug it into that but there are other

489
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:42,879
things that are going on through cell

490
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:46,360
phone there are over a million vehicles

491
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:48,370
today that Latinos - you are reporting a

492
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,649
lot of information about reverse the

493
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:53,050
vehicle back to the car dealer or the

494
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:59,080
manufacturer of some components through

495
00:27:53,050 --> 00:28:00,669
its self image I only have like two more

496
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,939
minutes

497
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:07,110
is there anything

498
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:08,520
that that's alluding to our visa they

499
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:10,290
have absolutely nothing to do this

500
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:15,200
presentation I don't know why it's there

501
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:15,200
but I was there along to go in actually

502
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:24,410
so you know we talk a lot about anything

503
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:27,260
you do whether it's on the right side or

504
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:33,180
anything to do with devices

505
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:37,890
manufacturing putting on security after

506
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:39,060
the fact is the worst approach and I was

507
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:42,890
having to chat with some of the other

508
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:45,389
day and they said give you example so

509
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:48,420
you're at a house and it's a point in

510
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:51,470
life you say you know I'd like to do

511
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:56,070
business how about all open up take care

512
00:28:51,470 --> 00:29:00,690
this is your personal residence so let's

513
00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:03,389
set a date there's only 50 kids how do

514
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:05,760
you think your house fits into the use

515
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:07,040
case of being able to take care of 50

516
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,850
kids

517
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:12,740
now let's say you have a feel

518
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:14,990
and you gotta build the place and your

519
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:18,890
intent is to build the place in that

520
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:24,710
take care of a 50 king's kids and

521
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:29,300
diapers preschool orders kindergartners

522
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:32,990
and your parents event unfortunately

523
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:36,080
some of the parents it's been going

524
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:38,450
about forest and sometimes grandma comes

525
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,770
from that I mean wouldn't that building

526
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:41,150
look a lot different than trying to

527
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:44,180
convert your existing house to

528
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:48,700
accommodate that need that's the same

529
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:48,700
thing that you need to do with security

530
00:29:56,099 --> 00:30:00,989
seems like that's unique reflects

531
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:02,658
conspiracy of all the systems it makes

532
00:30:00,989 --> 00:30:05,929
it more difficult for individuals to

533
00:30:02,659 --> 00:30:08,849
father their parting ways at that point

534
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:14,190
there's no doubt and that's something

535
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:18,418
the business works for however forget

536
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:22,080
about security before I would travel 250

537
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:23,879
miles without was 18 in my trunk there

538
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,239
was a fan though there was gallon of

539
00:30:23,879 --> 00:30:25,949
water

540
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:28,679
there were standing freeze there was a

541
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:33,029
camper they don't even know what that is

542
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:37,379
it was spare spark plugs business yeah

543
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:41,460
so you know the other side too is the

544
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:46,678
cheapest car today far exceeds anything

545
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:49,409
a Cadillac had 30 years ago so you know

546
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:52,529
there there are revolutions happening

547
00:30:49,409 --> 00:30:54,570
everywhere who liability used to change

548
00:30:52,529 --> 00:30:58,099
spark plugs every thousand 2,000 miles

549
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:58,099
now only do you change them

550
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:06,550
right right and as far place used to be

551
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:08,649
a pretty cheap metal and now they have

552
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:11,260
four or five really expensive alloys

553
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:14,230
sprayed one-atom-thick in a certain

554
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:18,430
order that machine deep elements on that

555
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:22,270
is behind me so you know in a constantly

556
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:26,350
evolving disruptive and manufacturing

557
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:28,720
environment people like Apple design the

558
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:31,840
next version of their phone with specs

559
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:35,650
that no manufacturer while they're doing

560
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,669
design koogler knowing that eighteen

561
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:39,010
months out and they're ready to

562
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:40,810
prototype it over 12 months out their

563
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:43,150
suppliers will have come up with what

564
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:45,760
they need that will meet the compute

565
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:48,310
temperature size and manufacturing

566
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,730
things the car industry is doing the

567
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,730
same thing

568
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:57,279
I think they like

569
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:59,200
oh they're not Apple but they're still

570
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,269
you know if you look at what they're

571
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,919
building

572
00:32:00,269 --> 00:32:04,809
so in our this price point there's a lot

573
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:09,669
of things around what what you want to

574
00:32:04,809 --> 00:32:12,820
do car manufacturers have a different

575
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:15,330
liability in the marketplace than Apple

576
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:18,279
how many Apple phones and kill people

577
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:19,809
lots but it's most because people at the

578
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:28,240
National Park and they would not only

579
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:32,918
one extra step I got two minutes

580
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:36,940
questions the challenges is with one

581
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:38,830
hand we're encouraging them to breathe

582
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,960
Digital Twitter's at work to the

583
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:42,519
manufacturing processes sharing

584
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,240
information that the down their supply

585
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:50,110
chain and you know I'm getting remote

586
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,769
support your machinery vendors and stuff

587
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:52,570
like that

588
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:57,129
on the other hand you want to keep it

589
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:59,559
secure so it's kind of yeah but but the

590
00:32:57,129 --> 00:33:02,110
techniques we use for security our first

591
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:04,090
identify the attack vectors identify

592
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:06,820
what song we can do can get in there and

593
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:09,629
then identify how to protect and how you

594
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,629
protected our

595
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:15,910
putting appliance firewalls have some

596
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:18,400
kind of security access have some kind

597
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:44,530
of validation on the air no it's very

598
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:47,400
simple I mean this to change but it's

599
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:52,620
not even in the near term horizon right

600
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:56,580
a question Alex I'm fabulous

601
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:58,260
I mean you know when I was a kid you

602
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:00,570
didn't have commercial check place okay

603
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:03,410
we also didn't have two of the states

604
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:03,409
things change

605
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:08,690
thank you very much
