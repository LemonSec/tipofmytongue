3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:21,930

4
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:25,350
firm grows we couldn't get Zach

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,160
Galifianakis and so we had to settle the

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,179
next best thing

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:35,010
we'll make do I don't have anything else

8
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:40,980
to say take it away enjoy yourself I was

9
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:43,079
up next we'll try and keep them off but

10
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,788
the this afternoon thank you very much

11
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,640
for being with us and really the key

12
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,590
here is to focus on an amazing lady here

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,110
Janice who's been doing some incredible

14
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,809
work around women and security and we

15
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,699
talked to the last couple of days about

16
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:59,099
topics you've heard me on stage culture

17
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,030
and AI and lots of different things but

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,620
there's one thing we really haven't

19
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,650
talked about that's how do we continue

20
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,320
to really raise the profile of cyber

21
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,390
security not only amongst women but

22
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,580
amongst young women and children as well

23
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,560
and it's been awesome seeing you know

24
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,450
that all the kids participating over a

25
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,490
park on in the other room where the kids

26
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,150
pose today and you know I was really

27
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,920
thinking about young women

28
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,020
how do we continue to keep them engaged

29
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,730
not just to lock-picking and studying

30
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,530
the code but how we continue fostering

31
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:28,420
that and making it something really cool

32
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,590
and this amazing lady here has been

33
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,390
doing a lot of work on it

34
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:34,270
so before we begin with the questions

35
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:38,310
when you introduce yourself well good

36
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:38,310
afternoon my name is James Mitchell I

37
00:01:39,390 --> 00:02:23,620
after I was the chief information

38
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,359
security officer at Nationwide Insurance

39
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,730
and said let me see if I got this

40
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,320
straight

41
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,660
company in information security and use

42
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:39,010
numerical and he literally went like

43
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:41,019
this and said good luck and so that was

44
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:43,959
kind of my exposure in the information

45
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:46,290
security so that was the way that it

46
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:46,290
went

47
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,070
our state security kamas Concepcion

48
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:55,440
takes out of our space apparently so

49
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,970
that's the way that it went before me so

50
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,050
it's a little bit different than other

51
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:02,310
ways or a lot of what I'll say and we're

52
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,380
going to talk about the difference

53
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,720
between young girls and young men and

54
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:09,450
how society in general pushes

55
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,240
information security even how we teach

56
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:20,280
the boys and the girls guidance

57
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:21,600
counselor's they go on from there so we

58
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,670
talked a little bit about your journey

59
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,500
in cyber and what got you interested in

60
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:28,649
security but you know we're really

61
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,200
focusing on today is how you founded the

62
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,820
Ohio cyber woman what brought you there

63
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,530
what was your journey that led you to

64
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,780
balance you know so that's a really

65
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,160
interesting question when I sold my

66
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,010
company so when you should sell your

67
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,079
company you kind of feel it's not really

68
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,940
what you think that it is it's not all

69
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,650
of the pop bottles and wine and

70
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:50,730
champagne I'm just here to share with

71
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:53,850
you it's just not my buyers were in

72
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:56,310
obviously New York I was here in Ohio it

73
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:58,230
was very lonely it was very depressing I

74
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:02,010
felt like everybody was getting on the

75
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:04,019
Cota bus I wasn't there and so I started

76
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:07,399
doing a lot of lobbying I was

77
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:09,570
mentally-retarded costs when I was in

78
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,600
and because that was putting a lot of

79
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:15,299
mentally mentally retarded class it was

80
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,610
not because I was slow it was because I

81
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:20,130
was a dyslexic and back then a lot of

82
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:23,490
people didn't understand dyslexia I was

83
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:26,219
a gifted dyslexic and so I decided after

84
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:28,560
I sold my company I wanted to spend a

85
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,750
lot of my time and effort lobbying for

86
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,670
the dyslexia field and so I spent three

87
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:35,520
years of my life blogging in Ohio and

88
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:38,250
naturally across the nation now you care

89
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,719
a lot about a lot about dyslexia I will

90
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,400
tell you a lot of that is because I

91
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,710
started what was called the program of

92
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,349
information when Ohio fell with a

93
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:48,120
dyslexia law that was kind of a big deal

94
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:51,150
Ohio is what's called a whole language

95
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,520
state when Ohio fell that kind of rushed

96
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:56,370
across the nation and allowed for a

97
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,990
difference dyslexia so you're kind of

98
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,450
like what the you know what does that

99
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:03,900
have to do with where we are today it

100
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:06,000
has a lot to do today because of my

101
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,310
knowledge account dyslexia is and

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,620
understand that one invite humans are

103
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:13,710
undiagnosed dyslexic

104
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:16,650
that also leads to believe the way that

105
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:20,609
we're going about people in the only

106
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:24,090
girls engaged in technology as a whole

107
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:26,640
isn't going to work simply showing them

108
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:30,080
something on a screen taking them to a

109
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,080
conference is kind of like this

110
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:37,780
good analogy isn't that bad well

111
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:39,758
especially if you're ADHD so back to one

112
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,469
and five London five means if you're

113
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,849
dyslexic if you're dyslexic

114
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:48,099
you'll learn right do you have to engage

115
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:50,199
education I also grew up in 4h we all

116
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:56,259
know it four inches four inches all

117
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:58,000
project-based learning so if we do

118
00:05:56,259 --> 00:06:01,300
everything with a project-based learning

119
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,509
and combine everything programs in the

120
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:06,699
schools have the teachers and the

121
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:09,280
classes do everything outcome based

122
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:12,669
project-based learning the dyslexics

123
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:15,809
will excel its top 20 in classes oh my

124
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:18,698
god why is this any different in

125
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:20,319
technology the girls are going in the

126
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:22,840
closet because we think their dark

127
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,280
hoodie and because we think is born and

128
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,590
because we just said behind a green

129
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,049
screen why can't we get two young girls

130
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:31,750
in the same manner why can't we get them

131
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:34,659
engaged earlier in school

132
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:37,300
give them the hands-on learning get them

133
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:40,120
to know what they don't know it

134
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,219
out of the hoodies and get them engaged

135
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,139
stop using the words with cyber

136
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:47,529
insecurity because if they're nine years

137
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:50,229
old like I promise you a mother who's

138
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:51,729
taking them to Valerie to school she's

139
00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:54,610
just not using the words of cyber

140
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:55,199
security so the way that we're doing it

141
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,659
is

142
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,729
I'm saying come play some games or

143
00:06:57,659 --> 00:07:02,219
reduce the prices and let's just see

144
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:04,680
what happened I don't give those words

145
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:07,710
on purpose and oh my gosh let me tell

146
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,449
you what I'm aiming towards the girls

147
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:13,770
that are musically inclined

148
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:17,550
I mean towards the girls that like to do

149
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:19,349
puzzles like to do cartography and we're

150
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,759
just saying just come play some games

151
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:23,490
and let us show you some different

152
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:25,319
things I'm hitting the inner city girls

153
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:27,689
the under privileged that we never ever

154
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,669
ever have it I'm hitting the Hispanics

155
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:31,919
I'm hitting my people they're Native

156
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:33,748
Americans and of course when I hit the

157
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,299
ones that are already Kurdish and the

158
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:39,539
results were are fantastic so we're

159
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,699
going out and doing so we have four

160
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:43,139
different levels so those are the six

161
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:45,810
through twelfth grade and we're doing

162
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:47,789
let's play game of it and the whole

163
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:50,969
purpose of that is it's a modified

164
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:55,229
capture the flag and then actually the

165
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:58,219
flag is also creating nine then it's a

166
00:07:55,229 --> 00:08:01,229
modified capture the flag it is

167
00:07:58,219 --> 00:08:02,789
non-competitive right it's a little bit

168
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:06,180
different than the way that a boys

169
00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:08,430
mentality is tactical right girls don't

170
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,710
want to have that so it's it's not

171
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:13,020
competitive because it's the sixth good

172
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,669
12 the thought process illustrator is

173
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,520
the

174
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:18,560
so it's a team learning basic event is

175
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,020
team learning everything then we

176
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,779
actually have then boot up a Raspberry

177
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:26,150
Pi teach them how the Raspberry Pi they

178
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:28,430
get excited to see it come alive we see

179
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,748
excited to see what it is and oh by the

180
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,729
way when they're done with the games

181
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:34,250
those inner city girls have never seen

182
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:36,740
it configure before they go to take home

183
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,690
the Raspberry Pi they got to take home

184
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,820
that monitor and they going to take home

185
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:47,449
the keyboard and their parents are

186
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:49,970
overwhelmed oh my god and then in the

187
00:08:47,449 --> 00:08:53,029
4-h model we call it an ecosystem

188
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:54,890
because our program has the pre

189
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:57,560
professionals who are trying to get the

190
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:59,420
girls understood program so the pre

191
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,699
professionals get all excited because of

192
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,380
this little stuff then the next level

193
00:09:01,699 --> 00:09:05,329
are they young professionals young

194
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:07,370
professionals are under the five years

195
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:09,019
so the young professionals are the ones

196
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:12,230
engaging and teaching the girls the

197
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:13,730
activities but the problem is is if

198
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,070
you're working for Huntington fine

199
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:18,470
dessert that you're working for

200
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:20,630
Nationwide Insurance here she's never

201
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:22,310
really getting that leadership activity

202
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:25,150
she's never didn't that teaching

203
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:27,439
activity I was she did that activity

204
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:28,910
because that's what we also have a

205
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,950
problem in this world do you know what

206
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:36,350
it is bias is bias but there's also no

207
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:37,970
women sitting at the table okay how many

208
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:40,460
women are sitting at the table at the

209
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,230
board level well I think you know when

210
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:44,180
you look at that you're right there is

211
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,710
very few women in security there's

212
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:47,060
hopefully developing more and I think

213
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,990
it's one of the reasons that we need to

214
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,579
focus on women

215
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:52,100
I'll tell you even in my own experience

216
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,960
I was the first woman to have her run

217
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:57,020
externally a security company internally

218
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:59,270
ceased at the same time and when I would

219
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:02,540
walk in the room I would be told to go

220
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:06,170
get the coffee this is less than five

221
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:08,870
six years ago and when you do same thing

222
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:10,520
in RSA on third forget I almost left I

223
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,020
would say a couple of years ago one more

224
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,420
person said it was cute that I was

225
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:16,550
running a security company oh my gosh is

226
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:19,870
so cute they put you in charge

227
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:22,640
oh my gosh it's adorable you're so cute

228
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:26,180
let me tell you these heels weren't

229
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,100
meant just for walking but it brings me

230
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,170
to a question you know there is a lot of

231
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,750
focus on young women and there is a lot

232
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:34,459
of focus on girls and security well I

233
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:36,230
know how you think it's so important

234
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,600
right now that's a very good question

235
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:41,450
because I tried doing this a long time

236
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,850
ago back in the year 2004 when I first

237
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:46,640
saw it sold I had Mike Morse was the

238
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:49,730
chairman of ATP ATP consumes the world's

239
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:52,370
and produces the world's most amount of

240
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:54,500
coal so I went to Mike Morris he gave me

241
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:56,330
money I went to Steve Rasmussen for

242
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,670
Nationwide Insurance and I started the

243
00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:01,850
same program all over again a very good

244
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,420
question so we had 25 women in the room

245
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:06,320
to start

246
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:09,689
oh hi Oh cyber weapon and all of the

247
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:13,900
women nationwide insurance

248
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:18,640
to a survey there's not a disparity at

249
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:21,420
119 and there is not a problem what am I

250
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:26,560
to you I'll tell you in the years of

251
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:30,400
2000 1998 to 2013 there's been a decline

252
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:33,969
of women in the IT field mi Hess field

253
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,920
is declining 73% and that happened when

254
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:37,810
Clinton got into office and Clinton got

255
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,430
rid of it in office testing and there

256
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:41,530
was a big push for women to go within

257
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:44,859
critters of being schoolteachers and to

258
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:46,870
be nurses so women had purposely decided

259
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,690
that we need to be nurses do we need

260
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:51,610
nurses but the reason why we need so the

261
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:53,620
next question you probably were asking

262
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:56,200
why is it so important that we have

263
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,090
women in the field of information

264
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,180
technology not just acai berry'

265
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:03,070
and all titled coming within dyslexic

266
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,959
and having served on the board of all of

267
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:07,540
these people they're so smart about the

268
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,910
neuroplasticity brain is a would by

269
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,800
nature of the way that she is as her

270
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:14,110
thought process is a more collaborative

271
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:17,140
than nature who thought processes more

272
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:18,550
strategic her thought process is more

273
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:21,160
pragmatic as

274
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:23,170
Mark's larger so it's not that she

275
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,360
better it's just that she thinks

276
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:27,939
differently it's just a little less

277
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,880
tactical the way that the solutions are

278
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:33,310
working in today's the way that we're

279
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,170
moving more towards a cloud there's so

280
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:37,239
many things that are going on on once

281
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,040
it's a less tactical point of view and

282
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,399
so we need to bring a little bit more

283
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,709
neuro diversity into the marketplace or

284
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,269
to work a little bit better I would

285
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:48,779
agree with you I think you know you look

286
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:51,820
at solid team security teams globally

287
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:53,769
the ones that are I think the most

288
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:56,560
robust are the ones that recognize that

289
00:12:53,769 --> 00:12:58,120
have a diverse workforce it's constantly

290
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,279
looking at things together - they would

291
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,529
agree with you on that from a girl's

292
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,060
perspective though you talked about

293
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:05,890
attracting young women from the inner

294
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,930
cities you talked about attracting a lot

295
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,579
of different types of young ladies my

296
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:12,010
question to you is you know when we

297
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:13,359
decide for age I don't know you guys

298
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:14,620
when I think of 4h to think of farming

299
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,649
and that's just yeah

300
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:19,300
yeah and so I'm old school girl scout

301
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:20,620
and I know the Girl Scouts I'm proud to

302
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,410
say are doing something as well with

303
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:25,209
contents of badges but you really would

304
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:28,360
we were talking kind of set me straight

305
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:30,160
about 4-h and so I want you to talk a

306
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,010
little bit about as you're trying to

307
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,750
expand the organization what 4-h is

308
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:36,339
doing and where they're really located

309
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:37,510
because I was shocked so I love you to

310
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:41,770
be able to talk about that a little bit

311
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:45,520
so 4-h has over 500 different projects

312
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:49,810
that you can take 4-h is the number one

313
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:51,880
project on inner-city schools like in

314
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:53,069
Los Angeles it's the number one

315
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,620
inner-city program

316
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:58,500
exist in Malaysia I didn't know that

317
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:01,649
that shocked me a lot of people thinks

318
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,660
there's cows and pigs I don't but it's

319
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:08,310
but it's also so I paid my way through

320
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:10,410
college with photography technology it

321
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:13,050
was not my personal company actually it

322
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:18,990
based on a photo studio and I paid my

323
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:22,099
way through the 4-h teaches you a lot of

324
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:25,589
different things on a consistent basis

325
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:28,380
just like girls count does but for ages

326
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:32,009
of projects base it's an interview it's

327
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:36,180
public speaking it's minutes it's it's

328
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:39,180
based a little bit more on how business

329
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:42,660
is run versus the way that Girl Scouts

330
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:44,670
is solely really their project based 4h

331
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:47,250
takes you through the whole business

332
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:49,319
this is how you conduct a formal reading

333
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:51,569
what you really really need to know when

334
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:54,240
you're doing the boardroom here's the

335
00:14:51,569 --> 00:14:57,449
rubric as to how you run the minutes

336
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,000
here's here's here's a president's role

337
00:14:57,449 --> 00:15:02,490
there's a vice president's role here's

338
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,820
the formal way to conduct ministers how

339
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:07,250
you would make a motion here's I mean

340
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,630
here's how you do public speaking and

341
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,520
then when your project is done guess

342
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:12,560
what you get to do you get to bring your

343
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,780
project book up here's how you go

344
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,180
through your interview process and then

345
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:19,250
you have to give in a public speech so

346
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:21,560
it really takes you through the full

347
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:25,490
gamut when you start at ninth grade you

348
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:27,469
can go all the way through your freshman

349
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:29,330
year in college so there's that

350
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:31,670
repetitive process and it's really

351
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:34,400
ingrained in there and it also teaches

352
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:37,010
that team aspect before you put the men

353
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:40,340
and the boys and the girls if you happen

354
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:42,500
to have a vegetable thing you happen to

355
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:45,050
have a photography project if you

356
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:47,870
haven't have a sewing project now you

357
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:50,000
take that project and you spell it if

358
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,410
it's an animal you learn how it's

359
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,970
attached to me and everything every

360
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:56,839
because you sell it and then it goes to

361
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:58,820
market you understand the Commerce so it

362
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:04,520
really is a little bit more business

363
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:06,920
oriented it's not just well I think you

364
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,329
90 debate the 4-h and Girl Scouts but I

365
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,740
was really interested in the education

366
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:12,140
because I think you're right if it's

367
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,490
giving the business skills that's just a

368
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,720
10th Mountain thing especially when

369
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:17,810
thinking about all the different areas

370
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,850
decide where where we need skills well I

371
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,650
think so that goes back to the thing how

372
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:24,290
did the young girls right so how does

373
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:26,209
the young girls how did they get those

374
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:29,180
how did you get so that's the big

375
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:30,590
problem in business and in technology

376
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,150
right the technology side of the

377
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,920
business speaks one language right

378
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:37,250
we're going to bring through a release

379
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,540
date versus end date so an MD from the

380
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,160
business side means one thing early

381
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,750
from the technologist deities and other

382
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,050
things so that's a big problem

383
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:48,480
so with Ohio cyber girls were trying to

384
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:50,430
teach them the business skills so that

385
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,709
they understand the technical side as

386
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:54,149
well as the business side so that's why

387
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:55,920
we're trying to build a kind of

388
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:58,110
archetype for each model and I think

389
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,310
that's awesome so one of the things we

390
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:02,610
did with apprentice program very

391
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:04,829
similarly was right out of university we

392
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,599
were bringing young people from cyber

393
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:08,428
crimes not cyber backgrounds have put it

394
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:10,139
through two-year rotations so in two

395
00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:11,640
years of rotation with us and then at

396
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,100
the end they were evaluated for

397
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,689
placement but in those were in next few

398
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:18,059
years they did four rotations and

399
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:20,459
similarly one of the rotations had to be

400
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:22,530
in client-facing or sales and every

401
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:24,089
engineer every coder I brought into the

402
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:25,770
program who was ready to have a heart

403
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:29,280
attack rented that you're gonna make me

404
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:32,100
do what I'm gonna go sell but at the end

405
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,960
of it to your point everyone across the

406
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,428
wards that it was their best rotation

407
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,320
because it forced about their comfort

408
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:38,940
zones and had gave them the business

409
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,918
acumen so it could be with you on a

410
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,870
percent it's a really critical skill I

411
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,880
think we sometimes overlook one of the

412
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,889
things that they're girls Harry say over

413
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,500
and over and over then wants you to be

414
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:51,480
comfortable with being uncomfortable if

415
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,620
you're going to be a cyber sister you're

416
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,169
going to learn how to be comfortable

417
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,658
with being uncomfortable because life

418
00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:59,820
isn't about being comfortable all the

419
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:01,690
time you know that you're growing when

420
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:04,460
you're uncomfortable

421
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:07,100
okay so I'm gonna jump on something you

422
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:09,020
said cyber sister and I think that's one

423
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,699
of the coolest areas of the program that

424
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:13,250
you have created is this idea of cyber

425
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,350
sister and making it obviously the cool

426
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,990
Club for girls to be a part of this so

427
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:20,360
tell me about her inspiration for that

428
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:22,190
and I think you've got a card right

429
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,870
there but can you recite the guiding

430
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:27,380
principles because I'm pretty excited

431
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:31,000
about it yeah I believe in women

432
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:32,930
i empower other women I am I am smart

433
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,840
she is smart

434
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:38,990
I'm having a positive impact on other

435
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:43,250
women and other young girls I am

436
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:47,420
conscious and I am aware that I create

437
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:49,850
my own destiny and I am and I will and

438
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:57,080
strive to be my best and I'll be frank

439
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:58,639
with you again before it before every

440
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,919
meeting you have that before every

441
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,929
meeting we do this but the thing that

442
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:05,000
this is a little bit different is I made

443
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:06,980
it into a little card and this is now

444
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,080
the cool card in Rome Columbus and it's

445
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:12,200
a backpack card that the only difference

446
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:15,730
is that if you come into the group you

447
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:18,530
sign it that you agree to the pledge and

448
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:20,510
then you have to go around and get on

449
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:22,428
your cyber sisters but this goes a

450
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:26,420
little bit different one of the problem

451
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:33,290
that we all know that women do is this

452
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:36,080
you walk in the room we're gonna lie to

453
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:39,590
each other I hate that and the other

454
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:42,620
thing that that was really really high

455
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:43,730
opening was to my male board members and

456
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:46,189
they're like what are you talking about

457
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:48,920
and all the girls in the group and this

458
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:51,580
was the most talked about subject in my

459
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,799
first meeting and they all said

460
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:57,279
my god we have the elevator lobbies and

461
00:19:53,799 --> 00:20:00,158
we want this stop the women cattiness

462
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:03,070
and so this is and I hate them and

463
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:04,899
Happiness because I'm very I was very

464
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:08,678
close to my father very close to my

465
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:11,889
brother because women I think are very

466
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:13,570
very cavity it's it's they think of

467
00:20:11,889 --> 00:20:15,668
something we don't talk about that we

468
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:17,289
don't talk about the funny part is I'm

469
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:20,200
seeing less of it in the younger

470
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:22,360
generations but in my group is refinish

471
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,340
is it's really interesting because they

472
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,289
don't work in the UK I don't have the

473
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:28,299
same issue there's a big group of

474
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:30,369
support in UK we all support each other

475
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:33,489
it's very very different but I'll tell

476
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:37,570
you the u.s. grandpa it is rampant in

477
00:20:33,489 --> 00:20:41,710
itself and says case in point example

478
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:43,330
when I had my twins and then my son I

479
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:46,029
decided to take a step back for a couple

480
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:48,039
of years and maybe just stay raise kids

481
00:20:46,029 --> 00:20:49,480
for a couple years I saw movie career

482
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:52,989
suicide and I would never get another

483
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:56,080
job again so so this whole that was an

484
00:20:52,989 --> 00:20:58,929
idiot buy another one yeah so this this

485
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,178
is this is helping we feel like if we

486
00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:05,139
get the younger girls to recite this

487
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:06,090
after every meeting and that I am what I

488
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:13,178
am strong

489
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:17,139
she is strong here strum Amanda I am

490
00:21:13,179 --> 00:21:20,889
strong you are strong you know it's

491
00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:23,559
getting yeah she's she's my cyber sister

492
00:21:20,889 --> 00:21:25,449
and I'll tell you I think that this

493
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:27,850
experience that she's had so what's been

494
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:30,539
your experience with me what's the first

495
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,539
thing that you learned

496
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:41,748
she's a way that I don't think luck here

497
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:43,820
yeah yes please take a picture of it um

498
00:21:41,749 --> 00:21:45,830
so I guess one of the major things that

499
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:48,859
I've learned is this like you said I can

500
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:52,070
do it I could be unapologetically me how

501
00:21:48,859 --> 00:21:54,230
that made you feel you've made me feel

502
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:56,149
better than I have in the last year I

503
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:58,609
was working on the government working

504
00:21:56,149 --> 00:22:02,299
with all men feeling like getting the

505
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:05,658
coffee all the time and because of you I

506
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:08,509
feel stronger I feel like I can do it

507
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:10,789
and if that's me at 37 years old already

508
00:22:08,509 --> 00:22:13,759
in the midst of a career change imagine

509
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:15,289
what you can do with high schoolers and

510
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:16,820
I think the critical thing here is about

511
00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:18,499
you know when you talk about cars like

512
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:21,109
that is it's not a men and women issue

513
00:22:18,499 --> 00:22:22,789
we didn't try to another women but we

514
00:22:21,109 --> 00:22:25,070
have to work together to solve some of

515
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:27,499
these diversity issues because how we

516
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:29,899
think how we approach jobs you know

517
00:22:27,499 --> 00:22:32,989
perfect case example overly these types

518
00:22:29,899 --> 00:22:36,619
of programs is I denied going into

519
00:22:32,989 --> 00:22:39,889
security six times was trained and said

520
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:43,279
no six times because I didn't feel I

521
00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:45,019
have the skill sets and that's that's

522
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:48,259
the other thing that we want to change

523
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:53,210
is that these position descriptions are

524
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:56,149
written to biased against women and the

525
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:58,879
other thing is that you have to

526
00:22:56,149 --> 00:23:01,309
understand again the neural complex of a

527
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:03,199
female the females not going to apply

528
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:05,899
for the job unless she can check off

529
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,539
everything in one percenter above and

530
00:23:05,899 --> 00:23:11,080
that's why you've got to be conscious of

531
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:12,460
the fact that the woman is so

532
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,199
[Music]

533
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:17,659
self-deprecating of herself anyway

534
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,119
because of the way that she was so I'm

535
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:21,799
Native American so I believe firmly that

536
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:24,678
we are programmed

537
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:26,869
or other but our parents and so you've

538
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:30,499
been programmed at some point to believe

539
00:23:26,869 --> 00:23:32,779
something doesn't work and so in that

540
00:23:30,499 --> 00:23:36,350
job description we're looking at what

541
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:38,720
doesn't work and if I don't work 100% in

542
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:41,689
that job description B as a female I'm

543
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,059
not going to apply and so it's not that

544
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:45,759
they're not out there so I'm not going

545
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:48,649
to apply because I don't matter

546
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:49,879
everything 100% so is that what are your

547
00:23:48,649 --> 00:23:51,379
long-term goals that's the what are

548
00:23:49,879 --> 00:23:53,360
severe long-term goals for the program

549
00:23:51,379 --> 00:23:54,980
like you talked about what you're doing

550
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,779
a new you're selling out events in Ohio

551
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,999
which is amazing what are some of the

552
00:23:56,779 --> 00:24:02,539
things that you want to do so right now

553
00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:04,639
we're working on right the other biggest

554
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:06,799
program that I have is so we have the

555
00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:09,619
other senior moon I have women that are

556
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:11,119
VPS that are in this group another

557
00:24:09,619 --> 00:24:13,850
program that we're working on right now

558
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:15,350
is a mentor program but my mentor

559
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:18,529
program is a little bit different it's

560
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:21,859
not just be a mentor I have a lot of

561
00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:24,859
women CISOs across the country that I

562
00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:28,658
want to actually spend time with my VPS

563
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:32,629
and say how did you get there and it's

564
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:35,769
I'm calling it more guidance program

565
00:24:32,629 --> 00:24:39,529
because in my opinion the word mentoring

566
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:41,600
and there was a lot of talk in our in

567
00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:42,250
our group about that oh it's a mentor

568
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,918
program

569
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:46,510
you know my wife is using you

570
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:50,200
know what mentor is just a bunch of crap

571
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:54,700
I want to hook you up with somebody that

572
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:57,970
is going to guide you they guide you my

573
00:24:54,700 --> 00:25:02,710
dream is to get you sitting on a fortune

574
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:04,840
500 board that's our next goal because

575
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:07,690
she's pretty excited about that I don't

576
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:12,340
you to it yeah and that's my next goal

577
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:15,039
and not it is not go have a speed and

578
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:16,629
that you meet somebody and then it makes

579
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:19,330
whoever's doing the group feel good

580
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:21,880
because they have this it's a planned

581
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:23,949
out it's a planned activity on both

582
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,809
parts it's putting together a program

583
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:28,480
with the people that are participating

584
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:30,309
in this event is for them opening up

585
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,750
their kimono and for them sharing with

586
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:37,360
you oh my god let's face it success

587
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:39,370
comes in the failure rate so it is me

588
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,918
hooking you up affectionate Siobhan

589
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:44,110
McDermott right Siobhan McDermott is a

590
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,059
friend of mine and she's on the chair

591
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:48,820
Bank of America she's had a vulgarism

592
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:51,158
and security and so it's her opening up

593
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:53,200
her full moment and saying to you here

594
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:54,140
are all the mistakes that I made in my

595
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,510
career

596
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:59,180
way here's what I wish that I would have

597
00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:02,780
known here's what I would want to share

598
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:05,900
with you now imagine what that does for

599
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:08,210
you so that shares a lot different

600
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:15,800
perspective for you this little eyes for

601
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:19,190
you to make your own what mistakes right

602
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:20,570
because yeah we're argument well still

603
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,290
put our pants on one leg at a time I

604
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:25,220
promise

605
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:27,920
success comes from failure success isn't

606
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:31,370
boys than success so if you can have

607
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:33,740
those one-on-one guidance and have a

608
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:36,020
true guidance with somebody and learn

609
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:37,970
from really where they're coming from

610
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:40,370
then that's going to elevate you and

611
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:43,430
maybe we can help elevate her to get her

612
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:45,260
sitting on in the board of Nasdaq that

613
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:47,930
would be a goal that I would love to get

614
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:50,720
her I got those kind of connections to

615
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:54,770
me that would be a successful program

616
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,270
that Ohio cycle women could have and

617
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:57,920
it's one of those things we target

618
00:26:56,270 --> 00:27:00,230
programs like that you know people I

619
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:03,230
mentor people or guided people over the

620
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:05,540
years but even in my rules I still

621
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:08,090
relied day in and day out on the people

622
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:10,070
I accept items coming around my my

623
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:11,870
cilenti's you need to have those

624
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:13,428
sounding boards and people that are in

625
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:15,529
light roles to your point so that you

626
00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:17,510
can discuss openly those hoops is in

627
00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:19,850
those failures because we all do fail

628
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:23,150
and then celebrate your successes or if

629
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:25,039
you a question to identify whether or

630
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:26,090
not it's the right questions to be

631
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,830
asking at that point

632
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:30,559
I've never taken rulers one guy who's

633
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:32,210
been in my life since I was 21 years old

634
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,340
he's been mentoring me for almost 20

635
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:36,110
years and I don't make a move without

636
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:38,120
calling him the same way you think

637
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:41,090
because he knows me well enough to tell

638
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,949
me when I'm being and also when

639
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:45,080
I'm doing the right things so your point

640
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:49,220
putting programs like that together it

641
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:50,928
creates lifelong friendships and the

642
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:54,380
ability to be honest about your career

643
00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:58,210
it's awesome so how could people get

644
00:27:54,380 --> 00:28:00,919
involved well this is corporations

645
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:03,740
sponsors we have a couple of those and

646
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:06,070
just individuals so we are getting phone

647
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:08,990
calls off the hook which is kind of fun

648
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:10,700
so we have companies that we have

649
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:12,710
companies that are calling us to come

650
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:14,390
have your meetings and our office come

651
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:18,470
have your meetings out of our office and

652
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:20,840
again our goal is to in Columbus were

653
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:24,649
fortuitous enough to have seven fortune

654
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:29,330
100 companies and a lot of we have a two

655
00:28:24,649 --> 00:28:32,408
unicorns in our city so one of the

656
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:33,790
things that we like to do is because

657
00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:36,880
maybe

658
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:39,340
yourself maybe you've never set foot

659
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,740
into what the unicorn was like for if

660
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:44,500
you see there's no nobody unicorns

661
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:46,330
no I didn't think so so unicorn is a

662
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:49,600
startup company that has the ability or

663
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:51,610
is looking to do an exit either going

664
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:55,000
public or sell for over a billion

665
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:57,129
dollars does a unicorn so from you know

666
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,320
being the CEO started a dream would be

667
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:01,120
to be a unicorn but some of you in the

668
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:04,840
room could know a couple unicorns Suzy's

669
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:09,639
killer was a unicorn trying to think

670
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:12,370
recently Snapseed was in corn and most

671
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,200
recently there was one other big

672
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:15,820
security one that just did it but those

673
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:19,900
are you know those ago everything when

674
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:22,179
we say anyway so the cool thing would be

675
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:24,490
for us to have a couple meetings inside

676
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:27,400
their office so you could see what the

677
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:29,590
culture looked like in there or maybe

678
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,840
the next meeting would be to be in

679
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:34,629
Nationwide Insurance so you could see

680
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:37,720
what the culture is like in there or the

681
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:40,090
next meeting is to have the meeting in a

682
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:43,510
JP Morgan Chase to see that the culture

683
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:46,990
in there so we're trying again in the

684
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:49,900
eyes of the community is that every girl

685
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:53,260
every young professional every executive

686
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:55,600
so that you have the opportunity to go

687
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:57,490
see what the culture is like to see what

688
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,159
the people's like in every different

689
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:02,080
places my feeling is if I pick one place

690
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,630
and I stay one place I'm really not

691
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:07,689
helping you decide how to grow as a

692
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:09,840
human being if I were being kind of

693
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:12,179
neutral and kind of move

694
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,399
every single different environment as

695
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:18,690
long as somebody has us then we're

696
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:23,279
exposing everybody for you to grow and

697
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:26,130
for you to say hey I know I was just

698
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,809

conferences for them to ADHD and yeah I

739
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:13,830

740
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:15,480
is it really impacting anybody it's not

741
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:17,850
really impacting anybody is not

742
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,860

743
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:20,580
me for me to hire anybody and are you

everybody is beating everybody but what

746
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:26,220
are you really learning what are you

747
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:27,840
really retaining and how am I really

748
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:30,450
taxing the other thing that we didn't

749
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,580
talk about was the cyber sister

750
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:34,650
Saturdays so now the girls are coming in

751
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:37,470

752
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:40,740
we really want to rock it out right so

753
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:42,909
now if we're rocking out a raspberry pie

754
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:45,639
Saturday so the girls we come in

755
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:49,989

gluten calorie limits

759
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,639

764
00:33:03,789 --> 00:33:08,080

LinkedIn and I have Twitter we were also

792
00:34:18,309 --> 00:34:22,839
they mentioned us about it

793
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:24,429
and Saunders mentioned our project his

794
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:26,199
she says we're the only one in the

795
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:29,079
country doing this right now she thinks

796

that it's kind of Bergen unique and so

797
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:33,579
in Saunders I can't remember of

798
00:34:31,059 --> 00:34:37,960
Microsoft and now Johnson & Johnson &

799
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:40,800
Johnson announced us out at Microsoft so

800
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:43,599
we're very very new and very young and

801
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,879
it's kind of overwhelming so I know

802
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:48,609
we're not very formal but I think it's

803
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:50,618
amazing and you know when you talk to me

804
00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:51,940
about getting questions and talk to

805
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:55,750
Cathy about it you know it's a mom of

806
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:58,720
three girls in and a son I didn't even

807
00:34:55,750 --> 00:35:01,000
realize my own gender bias like I my son

808
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,368
was interested in doing dot-com this era

809
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,900
and so I saw it with him and we put a

810
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:07,270
talk together and he was accepted nice

811
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:10,390
for the roots I never even thought about

812
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:12,099
asking my girls and they came they went

813
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:14,410
we went to wicked sticks together we did

814
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:16,270
a lot of stuff cyber wise together but

815
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:17,799
my oldest daughter said to be used we

816
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:22,329
were getting on the plane why didn't you

817
00:35:17,799 --> 00:35:23,950
ask me mom and I went hum I've got my

818
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:25,780
own bias things like it didn't even

819
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:29,020
occur to me because they don't tend to

820
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:31,150
you know in there things enjoy the

821
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:33,490
computers and the security as much as my

822
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:34,780
son so how do I change my own behaviors

823
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:36,879
to make sure they're doing the same

824
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:40,089
things so when you and I haven't talked

825
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:43,540
about this program I think it's so

826
00:35:40,089 --> 00:35:45,850
important because giving young women

827
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:48,340
Linux computers and being able to plan

828
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:51,370
very high and being able to have mentors

829
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:55,920
and role models it's just such an

830
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:59,770
important thing so Hugh research did a

831
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:04,980
rat Randy on this study about that even

832
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:08,680
if these kids go do I capture the flag

833
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:09,630
48 percent of young men know about 48

834
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,660
percent 11

835
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:15,640
what's the statistics of in young women

836
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:18,220
13 percent well it's great hat to that

837
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:20,230
size going to walks in 13 hours and 13

838
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:25,060
percent of the girls coming and this is

839
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:31,630
the worst worst statistic if you look if

840
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:35,020
I think Raytheon studied in 2016 asked

841
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:36,790
all of the high school boys 40% of the

842
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:38,410
high school boys were asked if they

843
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:48,759
would consider the career in cyber

844
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:52,960
security only out of all of that so just

845
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:55,000
asked just active so why are the boys

846
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,810
being asked to the school systems but

847
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,370
not the girls and of course all this

848
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:03,190
stuff starts with the parenting at home

849
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:05,470
so in the parenting and that's why we're

850
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:07,270
hitting the sixth grade because I know

851
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:09,430
for a fact the decision is already made

852
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:12,130
by the eighth in the ninth grade so

853
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:14,500
that's why and I know this from from for

854
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:16,200
age that's why I'm doing sixth grade and

855
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:20,860
again I had a lot of pushback on that

856
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:22,660
right and I pushed and the decision when

857
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:24,340
you graduate out of fifth grade into the

858
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,390
sixth grade that's the older whole year

859
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:27,640
and that's when they can make their own

860
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:28,799
decision and that's the right age and

861
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,240
that's where

862
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,460
the child is independent enough to make

863
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:36,520
their own decision and the decision is

864
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:39,819
either being influenced 78% of the time

865
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:43,690
by the parent or some phenomenal event

866
00:37:39,819 --> 00:37:46,599
ie what's happening next bill 1030 right

867
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:48,670
now it's agitating right now or the fact

868
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:50,740
that they come in and they get to root

869
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:54,310
they get to program and they get to

870
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:56,169
watch a Raspberry Pi boot up all by

871
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:58,210
themselves because they did it all by

872
00:37:56,170 --> 00:38:01,750
themselves that little light right there

873
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:03,790
is enough for them to remember it so we

874
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:05,410
have five minutes left I'm going to give

875
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:07,000
you a look for a second we've got five

876
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,799
minutes left and I bet there's a couple

877
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:22,680
of questions for this amazing lady it's

878
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:22,680
got a question or two by one question

879
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:52,710
well just for the people in the back so

880
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:55,080
the question was that it's fantastic

881
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:57,780
that she the location and Ohio are use

882
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:59,460
their concerns about franchising and may

883
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:02,250
be running into some roadblocks in other

884
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:05,160
areas so we got a phone we filled up our

885
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:07,320
class in less than 72 hours and in those

886
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:10,950
72 hours we want to know where your

887
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:16,110
phone call from they were here dayton

888
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:18,990
dayton has an unemployment rate of 13.3%

889
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:20,060
right now it's worse than employment

890
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:24,209
rate in the country

891
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:27,060
Marion Miami Valley Hospital has

892
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:30,090
volunteered to host it before I did that

893
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:32,759
my question was with Huntington National

894
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:34,320
Bank JP Morgan Chase if I got enough

895
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,000
interest in the next ten years would

896
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,220
they be willing to open us on what do

897
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:43,920
you think the question was but in the

898
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:47,850
answer was yeah so the next phone call I

899
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:53,640
got was from belfry Ohio it was down in

900
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:55,610
belfry and then about two weeks later I

901
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:58,370
got a phone call from Cleveland Ohio

902
00:39:55,610 --> 00:40:01,830
you want me go there in Cleveland Ohio

903
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:04,380
so I think I think the point is that

904
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:07,620
there are parts of the country where the

905
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:10,740
young girls just need a little sense of

906
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:12,000
hope even if they're not going to go

907
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:14,640
into cybersecurity

908
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,910
it might make them hopeful to go into

909
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:21,509
technology it's the fact that we're

910
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:24,060
giving them hopeful to do something and

911
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:25,480
I think it's the act that you have young

912
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:27,790
women

913
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,900
I'm not doing the classes there my girls

914
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:32,650
to other classes

915
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:36,339
these girls are 19 to 26 that are doing

916
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:40,180
it and the other thing is is that I'm

917
00:40:36,339 --> 00:40:41,920
very sensitive that these girls see that

918
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:48,480
they see themselves

919
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:48,480
I have Asians done it I have black

920
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:56,950
Americans going and so the other thing

921
00:40:53,650 --> 00:41:00,849
that I hear over and over and over is I

922
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:04,930
need to be able to see me and so I think

923
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:08,680
the reason why it was so successful is I

924
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:11,618
also had a lady fly in from Maryland who

925
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:15,129
happened to live in Columbus who also

926
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:16,869
wanted to be about arena and she went to

927
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:19,480
one of these events and she ended up

928
00:41:16,869 --> 00:41:21,910
anything engineer so I think that's why

929
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:23,290
it was successful and she had also said

930
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:25,868
you know I never thought that they would

931
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:28,210
dream of going into it that was the fact

932
00:41:25,869 --> 00:41:31,300
that somebody just looked up there and

933
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:33,880
somebody just looked like me I think to

934
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:37,869
add on a little bit is there's very few

935
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:40,500
programs right now that are really young

936
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:44,260
women in a material way there's

937
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:46,660
conferences and trainings but ones that

938
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:48,520
have real computing skills and there was

939
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:52,750
one in Boston that I was a part of a

940
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:55,060
couple of months ago and they had resume

941
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:56,650
advisors they had skills labs where if

942
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:58,328
you wanted to try a new technology this

943
00:41:56,650 --> 00:42:01,270
one was based more for a collegiate in

944
00:41:58,329 --> 00:42:02,950
high school level and it shocked me I

945
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:04,750
got off stage from doing a speech on it

946
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:06,819
and this moment was crying and she's

947
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:08,680
like I took three days off of my work

948
00:42:06,819 --> 00:42:10,900
because I was really questioning whether

949
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:12,629
I should be in security chief flown in

950
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:16,110
from Houston Texas because they had

951
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:18,060
like it in Texas only Boston to go so I

952
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:20,190
think you're right there could be some

953
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:22,170
skepticism about the success in some

954
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:23,670
areas the country but the reality is is

955
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:26,070
that we need programs like this because

956
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:27,120
there just aren't enough with that we

957
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:30,110
have one minute left

958
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,109
any other questions

959
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:13,980
yes so the question is is that she has a

960
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:16,220
niece who's in a rural area

961
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:19,740
she bought her Raspberry Pi computer and

962
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:20,970
she's getting pressure or not to play

963
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,589
with it or use it because it's not

964
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:26,299
socially kind of acceptable and not

965
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:26,300
socially cool so what can you do

966
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:30,079
[Music]

967
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:45,450
that was one of the things that we were

968
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:49,750
that's one of the things that we were

969
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:51,368
sensitive to too was how do we need so

970
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:53,349
it's not cool that's one of the things

971
00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:57,099
that the whole program is sensitive to

972
00:43:53,349 --> 00:44:00,960
is that it's not cool one of the things

973
00:43:57,099 --> 00:44:05,829
that we did was I had a little monster

974
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:08,950
her name was Olivia and we put her name

975
00:44:05,829 --> 00:44:14,920
on there and so we tried to make it fun

976
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:20,169
and had some games and we tried to make

977
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:23,020
it so it is cool and we brought in some

978
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:25,839
other people and showed and then we

979
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:27,460
brought in a lot of different things

980
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:30,450
have you ever actually found the

981
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:32,859
Raspberry Pi or website and been there

982
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:37,078
yeah and then we have and we have a

983
00:44:32,859 --> 00:44:40,980
elated that I found at Tufts University

984
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:46,060
that write some very very good games

985
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:47,589
that I can share with you the thing is

986
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:49,610
that you just have to teach her that

987
00:44:47,589 --> 00:44:51,920
life's all about choices and

988
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:54,140
then you have to show her the things

989
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,850
that aren't home and show her the fun

990
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:57,080
things to do with the Raspberry Pi

991
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:58,940
because there are some things that the

992
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,930
Raspberry Pi they can be nerdy but then

993
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:02,150
there are other things with the

994
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:03,529
Raspberry Pi though that aren't nerdy so

995
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:05,630
you've got to fight the other sugar the

996
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:08,630
robot things and things with the

997
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:11,180
Raspberry Pi that are early

998
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:13,340
so my advice having poor kids over there

999
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:15,200
in I live in rural area but power just

1000
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:17,120
to our north of Chicago right on

1001
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:20,689
Wisconsin Illinois border a tiny town

1002
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:22,640
bring a collar and my son is being

1003
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:24,800
compared plus everything about computers

1004
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,359
and he has picked on a lot about his

1005
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,730
love of computers and the fact that both

1006
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:30,500
his parents are computers was not when

1007
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:31,760
we really peel back the onion and why he

1008
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,740
was getting bullied about a little bit

1009
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,990
there was nothing more than jealousy

1010
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:37,819
because they didn't have the same stuff

1011
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:39,589
at home in the same areas friends homes

1012
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:41,570
you know it wasn't cool because they

1013
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:43,400
didn't have it too so we marched out

1014
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:45,650
about a segment like come on over come

1015
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,720
play really Kevin doesn't think you're

1016
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:49,190
cool great let's have have to come over

1017
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,990
and let's look haven't kind of have a

1018
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:52,640
play game and all of a sudden Kevin

1019
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:54,290
thinks that you know this computer game

1020
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,180
is the coolest thing since you know

1021
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:57,890
sliced bread and let's look at the Lego

1022
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:59,690
robot downstairs and oh my gosh I want

1023
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:01,160
one of those for Christmas too so we

1024
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:03,200
just kind of turn it on that and it's

1025
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:05,660
heads that point you really if the nine

1026
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:08,180
times out of ten if it was uncool or the

1027
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:09,980
kid that was saying it was uncool it was

1028
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:12,290
jealousy because they didn't have access

1029
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:14,270
to the same type of technology the

1030
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:15,800
moment we made that technology available

1031
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:18,020
to the kids that were saying it was

1032
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:20,540
uncool it became the coolest thing in

1033
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:23,900
the world and we also made being a nerd

1034
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:24,380
cool so my son little blond is running

1035
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:26,269
around

1036
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:27,980
baseball cap he will tell you his three

1037
00:46:26,269 --> 00:46:30,470
things he's going to be a zoologist

1038
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:32,269
he loves computers he's a nerd but he

1039
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:35,000
might give a small fire but he wears his

1040
00:46:32,269 --> 00:46:37,308
nerve badge proudly like people asthma

1041
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,410
jokingly saying he flies that freak flag

1042
00:46:37,309 --> 00:46:41,539
