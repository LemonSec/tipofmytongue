26
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:30,329
isn't that cool

27
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,829
we're at a cybersecurity conference and

28
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:35,699
he's teaching people how to sharpen

29
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:39,689
knives doesn't seem like it would fit

30
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,250
but that's pretty cool how many of you

31
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:44,908
have knives at home that you're gonna go

32
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:47,450
home and try to sharpen now talk to your

33
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:47,450
parents first

34
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:57,050
so I'm going to be talking about how to

35
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,850
publish a book for the next maybe like

36
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:02,960
10 minutes or so to keep my phone out

37
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:06,339
here so I don't go to long - how many of

38
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,799
you have ever had an idea for a story

39
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:12,170
really how many of you have ever told

40
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,760
the story to a friend or to a parent or

41
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,589
anything like that any type of story

42
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,040
could be a true story it could be a

43
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:22,010
pretend story show of hands

44
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:24,679
alright when it comes to publishing a

45
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:28,459
book the first thing that you need to do

46
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:31,370
is actually have a good story to tell

47
00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:33,860
how do you know if a story is a good

48
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:40,780
story do you guys have any ideas what do

49
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:40,780
you think very good very good yes

50
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:48,120
[Music]

51
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:52,920
yeah yeah very good any other thoughts

52
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:55,440
on that I'm sorry Tony yeah yes no don't

53
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,869
forget I have heard of some people of

54
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,120
publishing your book sending their books

55
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:03,030
online and getting feedback yep what

56
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,500
path is is one of the main ones where

57
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,810
you can do that it's pretty easy to

58
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,250
upload a book people will find it and

59
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:14,190
read it and they'll like know what they

60
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:16,200
think yes oh yeah absolutely well and

61
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:20,040
we'll talk more about that and later on

62
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:22,440
in the process - because editing is a

63
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,320
big portion of making sure that your

64
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,120
book is good so what I found is the best

65
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,739
way to make sure that you write a good

66
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,670
story or even that you're telling a good

67
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:34,380
story is that you want to have some

68
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,690
structure to it and you want to have

69
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:40,590
some conflict in the storage you all

70
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:42,240
know what conflict is a problem yes

71
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,980
problem in a solution that's a really

72
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,680
good way of describing it you have a

73
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,869
problem and you need to work toward a

74
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,020
solution if your characters can't solve

75
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:55,020
the problem then they lose right how

76
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:57,420
many of you have ever seen Star Wars the

77
00:03:55,020 --> 00:04:00,120
original Star Wars movie so at the end

78
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,459
spoiler alert they blow up the Death

79
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,830
Star right what was the problem the

80
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:08,640
Death Star was going to do what destroy

81
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:11,250
the earth yes the rubber baits right

82
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,690
there death sorry they didn't blow up

83
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,660
the Death Star the Death Star was going

84
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:18,329
to blow them up right so that was the

85
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:20,670
conflict in that first Star Wars movie

86
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,560
so when you're writing your stories you

87
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:24,810
want to make sure that you have conflict

88
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,970
in your story and it's not always

89
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,520
necessarily that someone is a bad guy

90
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:33,840
it's just that someone wants something

91
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:36,060
different than what you want and you you

92
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,039
sometimes in life you vote you can't

93
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,170
both give what you want right how many

94
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,700
of you have parents or guardians or

95
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,860
grandparents or people that you live

96
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,409
with who they want different things than

97
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,360
what you want sometimes you want to stay

98
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,110
up late and they're like no you're not

99
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,390
going

100
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,870
and so you're you have in that conflict

101
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:59,830
right

102
00:04:52,870 --> 00:05:01,990
now who wins most of the time well I'll

103
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,090
leave I'll leave your own family

104
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,550
politics to them and all can deal with

105
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,679
that the idea is when you're writing a

106
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:11,680
story you want to have some measure of

107
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,210
conflict in there so that the story is

108
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,070
interesting and so it's a story that

109
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,620
people want to be now let's say you've

110
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,780
got all that figured out you've got your

111
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,730
beginning your middle and your hand your

112
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,500
beginning does what what's what's the

113
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:26,710
most important part about the beginning

114
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,750
keep my music it introduces the

115
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:31,030
character and sometimes you're doing a

116
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:39,520
story in conflict very good very good

117
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:40,929
the most important yes yep yep sometimes

118
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,919
you get some backstory in there any

119
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:46,510
other thoughts so all that is 100% true

120
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:49,120
and all those things need to be in the

121
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:52,210
beginning the most important thing you

122
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,490
can do with the beginning of any story

123
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:57,789
is to hook people right away do you know

124
00:05:54,490 --> 00:06:00,970
what it means to hook someone grab

125
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:03,850
someone's attention yes same thing yeah

126
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:06,310
so how let's talk about Star Wars again

127
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:09,700
what is the first thing that happens in

128
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:14,050
Star Wars the first movie the original

129
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:15,039
movie yes they do the theme zone yes and

130
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,480
then they've got the scrolling credits

131
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:24,310
right so what's the first thing that

132
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:25,919
happens after that we should say do you

133
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:28,560
guys remember

134
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,460
so it's been so long I know it came out

135
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,819
before you were born

136
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:35,698
it came out before I was born okay so

137
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:38,370
Darth Vader is chasing Princess Leia's

138
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:41,430
ship right you remember that and then he

139
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:43,560
boards the ship it's so scary because

140
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,300
he's doing his boys yep

141
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:49,409
everybody can do the Darth Vader boys go

142
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:53,249
ahead go ahead very good all right and

143
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:55,650
cease okay that is a hook right away

144
00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:57,210
because it's a space battle this tiny

145
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:59,909
little ships running away and shooting

146
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:01,948
lasers back at the star disorder which

147
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:05,610
is shooting lasers at the tiny little

148
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:07,409
ship and then the first character do you

149
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:11,430
remember who the first characters we see

150
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:14,520
are I think it was either these one

151
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:20,039
troopers or the rebels as they were

152
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:22,620
getting ready to you might be right I

153
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:25,289
think it was actually c-3po and r2d2

154
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,659
though yeah because I is it does that

155
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:30,419
sound familiar and why is that so

156
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:32,250
interesting to us right away because we

157
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:33,599
see the spaceship and we're expecting oh

158
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,389
we're gonna see the people inside the

159
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,150
first things we see are these two robots

160
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:41,490
that's weird right it hooks us and so

161
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,929
when you're writing your stories you

162
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,899
want to have something that cooks us

163
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:47,639
your readers right away as well or and

164
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:49,979
this is true if you're just like telling

165
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,539
a story to someone in real life you just

166
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:53,580
want to say something that cooks them

167
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:55,188
and grabs them gets their attention

168
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:58,169
because once you have their attention

169
00:07:55,189 --> 00:08:00,089
it's a lot easier to keep it but

170
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:02,219
grabbing their attention right away is

171
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:04,740
super important because people have got

172
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:07,199
their phones people got iPads they've

173
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,240
got birds flying past outside they've

174
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,189
got their dog that's barking they've got

175
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,319
a baby that's crying they've got the TV

176
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:16,080
on you have to be able to grab their

177
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:18,120
attention from all of that right away

178
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,399
with your story okay so that's the

179
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,529
beginning let's talk about the middle

180
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,159
what happens in the middle of a story

181
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:28,589
guess

182
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:30,149
what happens so usually it's me and

183
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:32,779
that's the main inventing the stories

184
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:38,698
before after the beginning but before

185
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:41,399
like in movies it's usually the stuff

186
00:08:38,698 --> 00:08:44,339
that leads to the final yes

187
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:48,630
so another way of putting that is it

188
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:52,920
would continue the conflict that you set

189
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:56,189
up at the beginning and develop it even

190
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,719
further so in other words things get

191
00:08:56,189 --> 00:09:00,509
worse right

192
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:04,649
because for if we look at Star Wars

193
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:07,889
again Luke and Han and Chewie and

194
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:10,560
obi-wan what happens to them they escape

195
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:12,600
Tatooine right and they're on the

196
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:18,000
Millennium Falcon but when they get to

197
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:20,699
Alderaan where is it it's gone a billion

198
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,019
pieces right because the Death Star Luna

199
00:09:20,699 --> 00:09:26,758
and so when the what's the next thing

200
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:30,389
that happens after that it gets worse

201
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:32,149
for them right because again they dumped

202
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:36,779
his body

203
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:40,769
yes and then they get sucked in to the

204
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:44,819
Death Star that's no moon remember all

205
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:46,589
classic they get sucked into the Death

206
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:48,180
Star and it's way worse so that's kind

207
00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:51,360
of the middle the middle of your story

208
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:54,479
is you take the initial conflict and you

209
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,860
make it worse the reason you want to

210
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,180
make it worse is because that's the way

211
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,250
that you make your story more

212
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:01,800
interesting as it goes along if the

213
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,149
conflict gets easier to deal with then

214
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,790
that just means that your story is going

215
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:07,800
to end a lot sooner if the conflict gets

216
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:11,099
worse and everything gets a little bit

217
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,959
more complicated then your readers are

218
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,089
going to be more engaged because they

219
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,888
have to kind of follow along with all

220
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:18,660
that and try to figure out in their

221
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:20,310
heads how are they even going to solve

222
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:23,370
this I can't even figure out what would

223
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:27,869
happen and then at the end what happens

224
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:30,000
at the end of the good story yes come to

225
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:34,670
you guys next there's differ

226
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:40,890
man days before like older stories like

227
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:42,930
its wins badly like caricature and then

228
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:47,160
there's the more modern ones that are

229
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:53,550
better it almost always end with a

230
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:55,740
heroine it basically yeah so usually you

231
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:57,750
have a happy ending or you have a tragic

232
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,310
ending as what is what you're saying you

233
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,590
guys have other thoughts as well we'll

234
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:07,739
go with you first

235
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:09,600
yes no back down so and sometimes

236
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,940
there's what's called a bittersweet

237
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,010
ending to where it's like it's kind of a

238
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:16,290
happy ending but the main characters

239
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:18,689
didn't get exactly what they wanted so

240
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:21,660
they kind of won but they didn't win big

241
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:25,650
so to speak it's like when you go to the

242
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:27,240
casino and you walk out with no more

243
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:29,040
than you came in with but you didn't

244
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,270
lose money either that's probably a

245
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:36,569
little over your heads don't go to

246
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:40,860
casinos it's probably not ever it's hard

247
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:49,380
to winning casinos it is fun it is fun

248
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:52,770
but that's true just a lot yeah with

249
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:55,410
fake money if you take nothing else away

250
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:58,890
go gamble online with fake money that's

251
00:11:55,410 --> 00:12:00,510
my only advice cream okay so that's how

252
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,800
you construct the story you've gotten

253
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:05,100
your beginning your middle and an end

254
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:07,140
and you've got a conflict that you are

255
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,400
carrying on throughout the entire story

256
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,560
and you're making it more and more

257
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:13,350
complex until the end when your

258
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,140
character either succeeds or they fail

259
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:17,880
right so that's how you construct a good

260
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,319
story once you've got all that

261
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,280
constructive you've got it written down

262
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:26,070
the next thing that you need to do is

263
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:27,660
get someone else to look at it so who

264
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,630
was it who mentioned the idea of a

265
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,469
proofreader

266
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:34,000
that's how you sew a proofreader isn't

267
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,769
important proof reader actually comes a

268
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,110
little bit farther along in the process

269
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:40,060
what you really want first is an editor

270
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:43,269
someone who will understand how the

271
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:45,849
story is constructed what needs to

272
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:48,970
happen in the particular story so on and

273
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:49,630
so forth once you've got all that sorted

274
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,490
out

275
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,380
the editor does the edits then you

276
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:56,730
implement the edits and make changes as

277
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:58,779
necessary and then from that point on

278
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:01,060
then you would send into the proof

279
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:03,189
reader that will come back to you after

280
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,599
that you format the book I won't go into

281
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,300
that because that's really technical and

282
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,699
boring and then once the book is

283
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:12,040
formatted you find someone to decide a

284
00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:15,430
book cover for you how many of you are

285
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:17,019
really really good artists awesome how

286
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:21,310
many do you think that you can design a

287
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:24,579
professional book cover right now okay

288
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:27,430
alright alright be interested to see

289
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:29,800
what you come up with I have purchased

290
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:31,870
how many of you were at the at the

291
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,660
dinner last night and heard my talk last

292
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:37,630
night so for those of you who weren't at

293
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:39,819
the dinner one of the things that I said

294
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:42,459
is that I have purchased book covers

295
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,959
that cost twenty-five dollars that are

296
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:46,479
really good and I have purchased book

297
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:48,040
covers that cost six hundred and fifty

298
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,139
dollars that are really really really

299
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,790
good three of the books that I have

300
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:52,240
blown out two of the books that I have

301
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:57,459
out there

302
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:59,740
cost $650 for the book covers one of

303
00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:02,800
them cost 500 and then the

304
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:04,600
other ones cost a lot less it just kind

305
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,490
of depends on what you're going for them

306
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,530
what kind of rate you can get from your

307
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:13,620
hearts but it's important to have a

308
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:16,480
great book cover does anyone know why

309
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:20,200
because the first thing people always

310
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,760
see on a book is the cover exactly yeah

311
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,390
have you ever heard the same don't judge

312
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:29,380
a book by another that's fine when it

313
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:31,600
comes to people but with actual books no

314
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,640
you absolutely judge the book by its

315
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,260
cover so you need to have a very

316
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:39,250
important cover I cannot emphasize that

317
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:41,200
enough and then wrapping up real quick

318
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,460
last thing we'll talk about and I can

319
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,290
take maybe just a couple of questions

320
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:46,900
for your questions about the process -

321
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:48,430
but last thing you want to do is once

322
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,170
you get that really great book cover you

323
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:52,420
put it all together and then you hit

324
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:54,069
that publish button on Amazon what do

325
00:14:52,420 --> 00:15:01,589
you have to do in order to make sure the

326
00:14:54,070 --> 00:15:01,590
book sells you have to keep sacraments

327
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:07,090
advertisement yes that's part of it did

328
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:10,160
you have that so you're going to say all

329
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:13,270
right yes

330
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,270
[Music]

331
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:22,840
website and see how many yes so what

332
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,620
you're all kind of getting in here is

333
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:29,140
what's called marketing so you are

334
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:32,260
sharing the book with other people right

335
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:34,630
and so there are lots of different ways

336
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,430
to do that you can buy ads you can just

337
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:38,680
tell people you can get other people to

338
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:40,810
recommend it for you who will also rip

339
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,160
new books in the same genre there's a

340
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:44,469
whole bunch of different ways to market

341
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,079
but the point that you can take away

342
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:49,300
from this is that in order to publish a

343
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,910
book you have to create a good story

344
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:53,380
right we talked about a good story what

345
00:15:51,910 --> 00:16:00,660
are the two things that every good story

346
00:15:53,380 --> 00:16:06,210
has structure so what's the structure

347
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:10,569
the middle part well and and before that

348
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:11,860
and was that the last part so the

349
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:15,310
beginning the middle and the end right

350
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:18,930
and then you write you write your story

351
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:18,930
what happens after you write the story

352
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:25,540
just go ahead and say it and you get an

353
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,760
editor and then the proofreading right

354
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,650
and then after you proofread it and edit

355
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,500
it it gets formatted which we kind of

356
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:37,720
jumped over and then what do you do

357
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:39,400
about the cover generally it's a good

358
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,110
idea to have someone make a book cover

359
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,730
for you because they're professional

360
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:45,970
they've done that doesn't mean that you

361
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:47,380
can't learn but if you want your book to

362
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:49,480
succeed right out of the gate it's

363
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:52,480
probably a good idea to have them have a

364
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,550
professional do it right away and then

365
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,840
after that once you actually publish the

366
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:59,430
book what do you have to do we just

367
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,430
talked about it you have to

368
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:07,100
market the book very good okay any

369
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,449
questions it wasn't my wrap-up yes sir

370
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:14,599
are you for your daughter yeah no well

371
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm finished yes but my my designer my

372
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:18,409
artist is still working in the heart the

373
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,089
only reason I know about that is because

374
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:23,319
you came to my school I I talked about

375
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:26,119
it what school do you go to no yeah okay

376
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:28,670
so it's it's in the works

377
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:32,409
I assure you hopefully my Christmas but

378
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:35,380
I don't know it may be a long time yes

379
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:39,850
story

380
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,850
you can send Juby yes you got my email

381
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,850
how hard is it snake story it's not hard

382
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:49,428
to make a story it's hard to make a

383
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:52,040
story good its marketing is sort of

384
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:54,590
really good so anyone can tell a story

385
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,928
but it's not always easy to make a

386
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:58,340
really really great story that takes a

387
00:17:56,929 --> 00:18:01,190
lot of work you can kind of have to

388
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:02,449
study and learn and practice but you

389
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,520
know just like everything just like

390
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:07,280
kungfu practice makes perfect

391
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,870
right I need you Jitsu so it's not the

392
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:13,660
same thing but I understand the

393
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:13,659
mentality any other questions

394
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:30,970
yes yes well I found him sorted by

395
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,980
chance he and I were in a fan group for

396
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:33,639
another author together and we just

397
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,309
clicked

398
00:18:33,639 --> 00:18:38,559
we were friends on Facebook and I looked

399
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:41,289
at his art he was like whoa you're

400
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,879
amazing and so I contacted him and said

401
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:44,769
hey would you be interested in doing the

402
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,149
art for this and then he quoted me a

403
00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:50,679
price and I thought it was a fair price

404
00:18:46,149 --> 00:18:53,049
I hired him to do it so I got lucky

405
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:55,240
so I don't really have a good answer for

406
00:18:53,049 --> 00:19:00,850
that but there aren't there are websites

407
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:03,669
like Fiverr calm or what is it deviant

408
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:06,340
art calm is another place for your

409
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:08,799
clients or cool another talented artists

410
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,899
just have to find the type of art that

411
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:15,990
you want in a new children's book and

412
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:15,989
then try to work out a deal with them

413
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:29,710
actually that that's an option as well I

414
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:35,470
I have used a variety of online

415
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:37,900
promotion sites or promoting books book

416
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:40,470
funnel is one where you can get a lot of

417
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:43,990
free promotion but it's an annual fee

418
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:45,370
there's one called book barbarian which

419
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:50,010
is for science fiction and fantasy

420
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:54,689
there's my book cave they do some stuff

421
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:58,300
book bub is started the holy grail of

422
00:19:54,690 --> 00:20:00,370
publishing book publishing and different

423
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,500
promotional sites if you can land a book

424
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:05,199
bug deal you're probably going to make a

425
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,640
lot of money because but it's also super

426
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,070
expensive it's like two or three

427
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,120
thousand dollars sometimes to get a book

428
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:15,280
deal and then usually you make that back

429
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:18,969
so those would probably be the top ones

430
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,760
that I would suggest any other questions

431
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:23,860
otherwise I should probably wrap it up

432
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,620
okay thank you very much guys I gotta

433
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:28,719
run back it's my

434
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,719
