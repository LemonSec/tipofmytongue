1
00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:10,920
all right back to regular scheduled

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:13,070
programming here 1,300 DHS GE Henry let

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,849
it go Mike

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:19,800
alright thanks so much

5
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:22,500
all right everybody security cyber

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:27,210
security infrastructure security agency

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,529
here it's a relatively new agency we

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,420
were part of the National programs

9
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:33,750
protections Directorate prior to

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,760
November of last year based off the

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,860
threats and the profile to be coming

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,089
down and some of the recent events they

13
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,329
went ahead they finally sort of

14
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,770
resources online critical infrastructure

15
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:45,719
and that's where this agency really

16
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,480
comes from it's gonna focus mostly on

17
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,000
the physical security pieces as well as

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,059
the cyber pieces I am a wonderful I'm

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,730
sorry that's distracting anybody really

20
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:58,440
walking around as I talk so which is

21
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,538
just waiting games now how many people

22
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:06,539
here are part of a critical

23
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:09,450
infrastructure sector see a couple more

24
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,000
up here all right so the rest of you

25
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,650
this may not be the most interesting

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,690
topic you've seen today

27
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,130
but very doing some mean things and

28
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:20,070
there are some resources that you can

29
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,630
use as well most of what I'm going to

30
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,309
talk about today is going to be geared

31
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,240
towards what we provide critical of

32
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,240
structure sectors

33
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,650
all right so agenda we'll talk about Who

34
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:47,260
I am as a cyber security adviser at the

35
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:48,580
program itself the offerings some of the

36
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:51,010
protections that we provide for the

37
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:53,050
information that we gather as we go

38
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:55,720
through these assessments the services

39
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:57,640
or but what I provide what our teams are

40
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,650
darlington that sekolah provide as far

41
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,240
as technical assistance and then some

42
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:04,180
training awareness of reporting pieces

43
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,940
so unfortunately I know that advice or a

44
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,380
critical structure for that bottom line

45
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:15,390
train where it's reporting is something

46
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:20,049
that everybody's equity was next slide

47
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:24,040
so the program itself perceived system

48
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:24,340
and our CSS we are not as I was talking

49
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,400
about

50
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,800
we are not beltway individuals we are in

51
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,600
beds within the communities you see a

52
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,709
map here we're at there's about 20 of us

53
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,049
right now that are located throughout

54
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:37,150
the country we are part of your local

55
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,709
communities infrastructure so we have

56
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,110
built partnerships so that's what they

57
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:43,600
are clientele we don't have anything as

58
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:45,130
far as relationships as far as there's a

59
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,160
cost associated everything that we

60
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:49,840
provide absolutely no cost everything is

61
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,640
already paid for upfront better taxes

62
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,590
encourage everybody to keep paying their

63
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,290
taxes and we keep providing the services

64
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:58,540
but we do provide that regional presence

65
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:01,239
be able to go through it so not only so

66
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,829
for the response and recovery piece but

67
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:04,900
as well we also provide a lot of

68
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,190
services for their preparation the

69
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,959
awareness and preparedness

70
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,400
so that makes yourself our target

71
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:11,400
towards the it's accident

72
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:20,849
a lot of words on the screen again some

73
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,500
of the program activities summarize what

74
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:24,540
it is everything that kind of just says

75
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,180
our cyber preparedness risk mitigation

76
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:30,269
incident incident and information

77
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,579
coordination well as well as we go

78
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:34,049
through these assessments it may look a

79
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:36,209
little bit familiar to some people if

80
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:37,920
anybody is had any experience with

81
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:40,110
Carnegie Mellon University in the past

82
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,170
and there are men there the risk

83
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:44,450
management maturity models there's a lot

84
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,649
of different flavors of what they do

85
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,208
Homeland Security's been contracted out

86
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,459
with them for sometimes through a lot of

87
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:51,810
our assessments as well the model is

88
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:53,819
pretty sound that's been proven it's

89
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,670
been in existence for all those two

90
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:58,500
decades now so it's been adapted here

91
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,780
for critical infrastructure purposes

92
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,750
so you'll see that as we go through and

93
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:07,170
as well as the working groups for state

94
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,970
local partnerships again I said that we

95
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:11,790
worked mostly with critical

96
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:14,239
infrastructure I failed to ask is there

97
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:16,409
any state local tribal governments

98
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,798
representative here anybody best

99
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:24,660
affiliation with so those are also

100
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:28,469
partners we maintain as well these were

101
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:30,449
red so I am sitting right there he's

102
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,580
refined about FEMA regions so if you

103
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:34,060
ever wondered what FEMA region highly

104
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,719
resides

105
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:41,980
region seven so I love the gym or your

106
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:45,910
FEMA responders for cybersecurity at

107
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:47,770
FEMA region this membership these match

108
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:50,080
tickets more dots not hopefully next

109
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:52,150
year we'll look that we have a budget

110
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,909
and they don't go to another government

111
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:57,340
shutdown the plan last year was to put

112
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,600
about 30 more dots so our programs only

113
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,729
been in existence for about four to five

114
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,410
years now what we're going to be doing

115
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,810
here is out of the major cities

116
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,820
Coastal's I get a lot there's also going

117
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,790
to be you'll see some major Edessa

118
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:12,760
specially the southeast right about the

119
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:16,000
region 5 chicago Eglin think land area

120
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,229
they'll get some more as well this is

121
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,150
where rap

122
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:21,250
we are the advisors that are here in the

123
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:23,560
be convinced that spoke to so if you

124
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,630
need anything as far as federal

125
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,419
assistance but an extra belong critical

126
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:31,930
infrastructure or not we are your local

127
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:34,180
impetus that you reach out to and we can

128
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:38,560
tie you into other services hope you get

129
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:41,260
through a bad day very closely

130
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,330
Secret Service units of the local law

131
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,280
enforcement we have a lot of resources

132
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:47,940
that we can be able throw at you if

133
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,940
you're in need

134
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:58,420
all right so if first question what we

135
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,070
find is critical infrastructure this is

136
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:03,640
what the federal government designed it

137
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:06,070
defined as the one you see on there that

138
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,409
I just it's a sub sector that I chose

139
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:10,270
under government facilities just the

140
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:14,050
election of the structure that's

141
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:25,020
something that is a hot topic as well so

142
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:28,540
the Iowa caucuses spent a lot of time

143
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:31,000
Secretary of State's office plans and

144
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:33,640
actions and exercises to make sure that

145
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,220
everything's smooth we have a smooth

146
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,590
election cycle going forward but

147
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,960
everything else up there

148
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:43,330
- focus on most of the pipeline sectors

149
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,109
I spend a lot of time with water power

150
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:48,490
health care some of our river ways for

151
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:53,580
the lots of data systems that are on

152
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:53,580
there obviously I spend a lot of time

153
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,560
this can be interacted too so if anybody

154
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:17,760
has a question at any time please feel

155
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,760
free to raise your hand

156
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:28,510
so everything that we do aligns to NIST

157
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:31,660
cybersecurity framework so a lot of our

158
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:34,210
stuff has mapping to the framework

159
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,800
itself so a lot of our stuff we've

160
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,710
already across once you go through

161
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:47,580
various crosswalks as far as the 800

162
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:47,580
series no oh it's up sorry I missed

163
00:07:53,410 --> 00:08:03,920
yes yes yes so our national security

164
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,260
protection plans and all that you'll see

165
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,940
the presidential policy directive so

166
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:10,840
they all do time and this is how

167
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:13,160
Congress goes through to be able to

168
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,960
allocate our funding based off those

169
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,810
plans that are developing the national

170
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:21,739
cybersecurity strategies those all come

171
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:23,450
into play in as US regional guys you try

172
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,000
some anyway out on the Beltway politics

173
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:29,420
on all that we usually do more of the

174
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,740
ash with that election so today with

175
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,990
those decisions gonna look like but

176
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,610
that's what shaped into today percent

177
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:38,180
that the Congress the Congress we make

178
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:40,820
decisions but reality out of wood which

179
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:47,109
sectors here folks settled answer your

180
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:47,110
question now is there a correlation

181
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:57,680
so and one of the themes that we're

182
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,869
gonna talk about here is we talked about

183
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,579
that awareness and preparedness to be

184
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:04,040
able to helping yourself harder target

185
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:07,820
because we have attacked or being a

186
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:10,699
victim but really what my focus is more

187
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:13,610
is not so much the actual security

188
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,980
pieces of snow in society and your

189
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:17,779
organization's going to go on any

190
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:21,589
undergo any number of stressors it

191
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:24,770
doesn't have to be a black hoodie guy in

192
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:27,290
a basement you know shoot packets back

193
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:32,810
down into your service it could be

194
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:35,089
flooding tornadoes there's any number of

195
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,770
specimens what we want to do is be able

196
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:38,480
to make sure they've got plans because

197
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:40,460
you've been able to exercise and mature

198
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,130
they'll get back to a normal operating

199
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:44,450
space but it's possible attacks are

200
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,970
gonna happen they're gonna change them

201
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:50,210
you can all shoot if it performs so what

202
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:52,520
we will hear me do an exercise that what

203
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:53,660
is going to happen when how we're going

204
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,210
to react when something like that

205
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:58,819
happens and to be able to bless your

206
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:04,339
follow up legs together and it's not on

207
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:05,750
the service you get access so we'll talk

208
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:08,380
about a lot of this as we go through our

209
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,380
assessments

210
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:16,280
so as I mention I am from Homeland

211
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,819
Security I am part of the federal

212
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,530
government

213
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,910
why would anybody wanna share the

214
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:22,160
information with the federal government

215
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,300
they were obligated to we are invitation

216
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,550
only

217
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:28,359
we've only been ignored for your asses

218
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:30,229
too unless you are state local or tribal

219
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,930
entity that we can actually pull

220
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:35,000
plug-ins or non-traditional but for the

221
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:36,589
rest of those sectors we can't just come

222
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,550
in and kick the door down as they're

223
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:40,220
asking questions

224
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:42,469
we're not auditors our regulators have

225
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,460
no authority whatsoever if you didn't

226
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:45,380
tell you that you need to implement

227
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:47,630
anything or make recommendations for

228
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:50,870
unit for anything it makes me a terrible

229
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:53,890
adviser but I give you options for

230
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:55,240
consideration and that's what our larger

231
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:58,580
body

232
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:01,400
where I say that well it's almost to do

233
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:04,210
this spill got packed that means we get

234
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,980
brought into national legal

235
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:10,370
so we have to be very careful how we

236
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:13,610
tread and look but Burbage according to

237
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:15,290
use I should tell you well these are the

238
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:17,420
best practices in the industry these are

239
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:19,250
options you should consider implementing

240
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:23,719
to make sure your affiliates when

241
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:27,230
attacked so you share information with

242
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:29,830
us it is protected as long as it's

243
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:32,920
critical of a structure and under the

244
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:36,950
tactical in the structure Act of 2002

245
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,630
what that does is that anything you

246
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:40,700
share the federal government has to do

247
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:43,580
with your utility or your government

248
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:46,220
office we have to protect it under

249
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:49,070
criminal penalties so if I was a third

250
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:52,160
party person feminine as a security

251
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:54,500
consultant who designed house closure

252
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,390
agreement if I were to leave your

253
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,210
information I would fail to do my due

254
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:02,060
diligence to protect it we've got court

255
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:05,180
and abusive litigation sue me and pay

256
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:11,359
fines here instead I go to federal

257
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:12,370
prison so there's a strong strong reason

258
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,540
for us to be able to

259
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:17,050
information to make sure that it's

260
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:19,870
protected that also supersedes Freedom

261
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:22,709
of Information Act requests any state

262
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:25,210
local sunshine laws that have a

263
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:27,310
exploiters as well as the use of civil

264
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:29,440
litigation might were to get hurt they

265
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:33,390
knew this you had these assessments

266
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,890
taking those that subpoenas report along

267
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:39,449
in summarizing that's that's what all

268
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:41,860
those words there's a lot of more time

269
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:45,160
so the advisers themselves here's what I

270
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:47,380
do for all of my Barber's first most of

271
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,140
all they need to discuss Rebecca is a

272
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:52,540
very task level controllers based

273
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,100
assessment it's interview based when we

274
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,860
sit down we're talk about that Union

275
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:59,320
Control Center five domains all the guys

276
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,029
if we can't read the five domains of the

277
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,279
right-hand corner worker but through a

278
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:05,050
tough supposed to be covered up your

279
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,600
personality manage things how you

280
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:10,959
measure your instant response programs

281
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:14,050
tendencies you have as well as some of

282
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,640
the actual management activities most of

283
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,800
the things we see are technical based

284
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,350
that actually precedes really base to

285
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,060
the threat exposure rates we see a lot

286
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,070
of our partners have or because they do

287
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:26,380
practices poorly not because they have

288
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:28,890
for technical augmentations

289
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:33,780
they have firewalls they just don't do

290
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:36,510
man or that they have the capability to

291
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:38,790
do strong network segmentation but as we

292
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:40,350
found kind of a hindrance on the actual

293
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,390
organization able to maintain that

294
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,560
possible separation of different

295
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,280
entities and they still get up and

296
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,349
operate

297
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:48,720
so this is something that we were

298
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,940
talking about read early throughout all

299
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,940
the assessments it's a very processing

300
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:56,420
procedure real mixed it's making these

301
00:13:53,940 --> 00:14:01,020
implementations are also very low cost

302
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:03,569
many organizations and you can actually

303
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:05,550
really experience your exposure to

304
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:13,020
attacks just by implementing processes

305
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:16,890
that you see us it's something that I'm

306
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:19,650
asking a lot of money to be able to try

307
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:21,270
this secure Network we need to get off

308
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,220
because we've had too much to drink

309
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:25,560
mostly when we thought were going to

310
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,590
talk about how to fix put in policies

311
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:31,260
enforce policies and procedures and

312
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:33,830
enforce those to be able to prove your

313
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,830
superior

314
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:39,330
so but this looks like at the end the

315
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:42,260
deliverable is a dashboard dashboard

316
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:45,360
text puts you in a high water mark

317
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:46,650
against you and your peers so we don't

318
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,190
collect information or share your

319
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:52,530
information demographic imperative in

320
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:54,570
two tiers so whether or not you're an

321
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:57,030
organization and services as many people

322
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:59,790
as an IT staff of this much you'll be

323
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:02,160
prepared to similar organizations and

324
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:03,780
you'll see the hot immediate though but

325
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,780
you're also be able to do start doing

326
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:08,430
organ in its table talking with it you

327
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,930
look at the top right you'll see that

328
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:11,729
you can put in a different type of

329
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:18,870
stress for situations like natural

330
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:20,850
disaster access aisle service there's

331
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:25,050
several others that are out there that

332
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:28,560
are listed and then we can also say

333
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:30,780
where should we invest and bars move as

334
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,229
you start putting in these variables so

335
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:35,079
you can use this as

336
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:37,240
plus it's so tactical in nature it's not

337
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,970
something your percentage our leadership

338
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:44,100
or board because they're gonna try to

339
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:44,100
get to that green mark and that's really

340
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:50,310
beside design statement

341
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,780
five domains I talked about it'll also

342
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,480
do the same thing so your overall

343
00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:00,970
aggregate break it down for each

344
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,520
different domain just a new a different

345
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:07,770
view saying different type of scenarios

346
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:10,329
and tabletop use one of those as well

347
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:15,270
that was the US side security in

348
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:15,270
distress yes

349
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:20,060
bloody tosser

350
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:34,450
so the question was about the 16

351
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,980
different sectors and the energy sectors

352
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:38,860
specifically whether or not they were

353
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:42,370
utilizing this more than others the

354
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:45,430
answer is no and there's a reason why

355
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:49,210
the explanation is is that they are

356
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:53,939
extremely regulated by nature so nerve

357
00:16:49,210 --> 00:17:01,600
our National Energy Alliance Corporation

358
00:16:53,940 --> 00:17:05,040
under FERC if you know anybody in the

359
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:09,220
energy sector the best cyber security

360
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:11,440
for the Newark website should have a

361
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:14,709
crisis hotline number they should have

362
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:17,890
support groups what they do for their

363
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:19,870
nervous if regulatory compliance

364
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:23,530
mechanisms is absolutely horrendous it

365
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:25,689
is in my opinion it becomes

366
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:26,829
counterproductive the cybersecurity so

367
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,329
depending on whether that's for

368
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:30,010
generating power your transmitting power

369
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:31,590
or whether not you're just distributing

370
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:35,230
power puts you into several categories

371
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:37,959
if you violate our civil regulations you

372
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:40,830
have up to fourteen different because

373
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,830
I've said fourteen

374
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:47,600
so this is about 12 different

375
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:53,390
regulations you can be subject to

376
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:57,740
penalties per day per current regimen

377
00:17:53,390 --> 00:18:00,320
for each violation against a particular

378
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,490
vendor but if you look at your

379
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,679
smartphone's they are publicly traded

380
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:06,470
sort of every report but one minute just

381
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:08,840
recently was fined over ten million

382
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:11,150
dollars and they should have been

383
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:14,510
expected and that number was as low as

384
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:17,330
it was that was a settlement offer so

385
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:20,000
there is a huge amount of risk they

386
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:22,760
undertake by implementing stronger

387
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,610
psychosurgery security controls outside

388
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:29,030
what they're required to they require an

389
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:32,060
additional cyber security are they they

390
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:35,660
do they're now subjects have to be

391
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:39,710
audited off those controls if it's part

392
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:43,430
of their set plan again the regulation

393
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:45,320
and when we do things come sometimes we

394
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:51,000
kind of productive energy is one of

395
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:53,549
those I digress greatly I'm sorry

396
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,340
to be company kids we aren't invited

397
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:58,080
only and energy is one of those folks

398
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,000
that you really understand through city

399
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:04,168
but you have to be empathetic to our

400
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:07,440
situation and implement these this is

401
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:10,260
the situation of risk management I got

402
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,490
to explain try to get management to say

403
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:15,780
well I accept that risk a lot of times

404
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:17,880
bankrupted Corporation and the company

405
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:20,120
answerís and they'll do what you have to

406
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,120
do

407
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,299
the next what we do as well as the

408
00:19:29,379 --> 00:19:32,860
external dependencies so with managed

409
00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:34,870
service providers or cloud service

410
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:39,250
providers and the trend for people

411
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:40,989
taking off premise that we went ahead

412
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,399
all of our assessments will address

413
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:45,129
external dependencies in one way or

414
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:48,039
another but there was a very low

415
00:19:45,129 --> 00:19:52,509
performing sector so I had created a

416
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:53,830
brand new assessment here and it's going

417
00:19:52,509 --> 00:20:00,610
to assess pretty much three different

418
00:19:53,830 --> 00:20:02,889
areas three areas it's been a dresser

419
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:05,080
how you enter into relationships with

420
00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:06,969
third parties the agreements the service

421
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,460
level agreements this unit the contracts

422
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,570
however it is one of the steps that you

423
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:13,210
would take and whether the

424
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:16,149
considerations you made when entering or

425
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:18,190
was that relationship the second domain

426
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:20,500
is once you're in a heavy bull Devin her

427
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:24,519
accountable that contractor accountable

428
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:27,279
to those things to ask you if they're

429
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:30,240
for our response times and they break

430
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:30,240
what are you

431
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,459
[Music]

432
00:20:54,220 --> 00:21:07,400
everybody so there's a lot of different

433
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,870
scenarios particular a lot of different

434
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,790
directions we look at three different

435
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:13,250
areas relieve your suppliers we looking

436
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:15,250
through contractors or bankers you look

437
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:18,490
at your government infrastructure

438
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:23,050
providers as far as with fire police

439
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:28,220
emergency services and telecom

440
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:30,950
structures side for this one the

441
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:32,810
deliverable it's a fairly lengthy report

442
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:34,760
with options to consider

443
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:37,490
again there's crosswalks every single

444
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:39,080
question of identifying the surety level

445
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:40,310
was the trigger of each and it's going

446
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,899
to tell you where you can go through

447
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:44,139
remember I said several different

448
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:46,720
documents as the divinest

449
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:55,120
on how to go through

450
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:57,340
patience to improve your area Messrs the

451
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,800
last one we do is the the biggest one

452
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:02,470
this one takes about a full day to do or

453
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:04,480
the other to think about cyber

454
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:07,750
resilience review that's ten different

455
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:10,180
domains this one is everybody do I look

456
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:12,400
at the other two do I have to come in to

457
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:15,270
do but this box here in the middle of

458
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,710
the sea Cuba voluntary program website

459
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:20,170
you can go and actually get a little D

460
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:24,250
CRR and you self assessment so you can

461
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:26,010
better this for yourself you want help

462
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:29,530
doing it you can always give me a call

463
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:31,690
my number after there's a slight with

464
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:34,389
family and career right take a picture

465
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:38,740
up but this assessment does think about

466
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:40,920
six to eight hours correctly there's ten

467
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:43,300
different domains is going to go through

468
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:45,520
the biggest would be an asset management

469
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:48,100
as everything else pitches on what

470
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,480
assets you have deployed a lot of times

471
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,399
what we find out is people don't even

472
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,070
know what's in their network so how are

473
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,550
you managing how IT security regulator

474
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:57,110
change management

475
00:22:55,550 --> 00:23:01,570
management but even though it's out

476
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:06,199
there so we focus a lot of time I said

477
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:09,260
so it's usually pretty shocking to the

478
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:11,840
organization because we had very

479
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:15,020
different answers from management we do

480
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,720
for security team we neutralize the

481
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:20,480
operations team so wants to associate

482
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,620
and nobody that's a pool a lot of times

483
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,280
seen in the way it's a full picture

484
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,280
what's really

485
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:35,389
so this one zero but I they are all

486
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:37,879
intervene base very Savannah red talk a

487
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:41,270
lot about theory and academia and

488
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:42,230
processes and procedures all prison

489
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:44,540
boring stuff

490
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:47,630
the in cats pain does have all the fun

491
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:51,170
they are the ones directions that men do

492
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:54,290
the physical assessments and first one

493
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:56,090
that they do is with a lot of words in

494
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:58,909
the Supreme knows that this is necessary

495
00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:00,830
so uncredentialed external messes

496
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:04,130
scanning that your IP spaces board

497
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:07,610
facing to the internet they will give

498
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:10,430
you a weekly report of what your

499
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:12,830
vertical I media gloves are along with

500
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:14,090
the normal of necess CVD type

501
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:16,520
instructions I've had to be there

502
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:18,649
mitigate or any of those reports those

503
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,210
will come through every Monday a lot of

504
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:22,870
people funding useful they're already

505
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:28,400
doing from digital internal scanning or

506
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:31,479
your third party to it cost charge DHS

507
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,480
provided for you as well

508
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:40,419
yep CMS's report that's colorful

509
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:43,209
management like some IT people usually

510
00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:44,830
hate or tris does to tell you this

511
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:47,200
people are going to explain why you're

512
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:50,289
not Patrick it doesn't give you a lot of

513
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,179
space to say well it breaks everything

514
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:54,039
else we're doing boss so yeah we didn't

515
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:56,259
catch it it's been on there before and

516
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:58,090
have possibly understand that but it

517
00:24:56,259 --> 00:24:59,200
doesn't drive the conversation do we

518
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:01,600
have a plan on how we're actually

519
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,100
putting other controls in place while

520
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,610
we're trying to figure out how we can

521
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:08,320
patch it again I would recommend having

522
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:14,529
your management staff request this

523
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:15,309
service people's vision campaigns is a

524
00:25:14,529 --> 00:25:17,769
fun one

525
00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:20,799
we tested Asian from the organization

526
00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:23,769
we'll start developing the Winter Park

527
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,418
campaign the organizational fish you for

528
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:27,100
six weeks

529
00:25:25,419 --> 00:25:29,169
there's gonna be varying levels of

530
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:32,230
complexity on the actual fish in itself

531
00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:35,529
so one will be very high number of

532
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:37,600
indicators to compromise Nigerian prince

533
00:25:35,529 --> 00:25:39,789
type scenario and some of them will I

534
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:44,399
have a single indicator where you're at

535
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:44,399
mouse-over see that it's not actually

536
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:50,080
it's gonna test test your employees that

537
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:52,899
your organization is agata fish meat

538
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,960
attempts which is where we see a lot of

539
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:58,600
our actual miss a lot but I say most of

540
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:02,520
our teachers are coming from the initial

541
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,520
vector Azores back to fishing

542
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:10,280
report on this one this kind of me in

543
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:13,160
Italian clinics how fast they clicked

544
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,629
you guys serial clickers if the next

545
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,490
record flickers the Russian trying to

546
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:19,700
troubleshoot and open it up different

547
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:23,090
browsers download the devices and really

548
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:25,460
try to get a document or linked out so

549
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:28,659
it'll give a give you an idea of where

550
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,660
you need to focus the most rain

551
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,280
so the question is our abilities of

552
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:43,250
these organizations upset that they're

553
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:46,370
tricked into doing this so a lot of that

554
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:47,810
has to do policy is there acceptable use

555
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:50,060
policy on the network

556
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:52,610
do you accept do you consent to

557
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:54,950
monitoring those our company assets this

558
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:57,290
year they say here you know you're gonna

559
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:59,300
target the company SS I would never ask

560
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:01,840
you to put your employees personal

561
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,840
emails on

562
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:08,080
those company resources the assets the

563
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,840
team oh there's a policy in place to be

564
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:15,699
able to stand in operating under that

565
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:16,899
policy some people and organizations

566
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,150
handle is very different

567
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:22,000
some take the carrot some actually take

568
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:25,750
a very large stick nerves to deal with

569
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,210
employees and to react to real old

570
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:30,700
fishing tips you need to know before

571
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:32,470
another free service and so I wrote

572
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:34,330
promote any services by the way this is

573
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:38,800
just one that a recent customers had we

574
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:42,370
used this and after five attempts we

575
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:45,070
terminate the flow mr. in service they

576
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:47,290
take stickers now they want to set their

577
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:50,770
well we have a button in the employee

578
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:54,740
that's report fishing and the division

579
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:56,690
that has the most reports the

580
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:59,470
especially we go ahead and reward them

581
00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:02,690
and there's usually some kind of yeah

582
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:05,780
time off or pizza party or so

583
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:07,280
so there's a very careful approach again

584
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:09,730
it's up the organization because

585
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:12,200
participative I take this this nature is

586
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:13,340
critical that that is how much they

587
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,970
actually cost

588
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:22,250
they were there by something that really

589
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:32,480
operations so all those words to say it

590
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:33,380
depends for Isis customers that they're

591
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,960
trying to figure out whether or not

592
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:38,120
their network is design corrected Idaho

593
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,549
National Labs folks do with the

594
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,379
cultivator really what they're looking

595
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:44,870
at here is the actual architectural

596
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:46,490
design the traffic flows they'll give

597
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:48,168
you a lot of inputs on how to be able to

598
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,700
improve that they're not gonna touch

599
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:51,020
your network in any way they're asking

600
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,580
you to provide all this and sit down

601
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,620
with your engineers and they're gonna

602
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:56,960
discuss all your system logs for

603
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:59,840
catalogs the actual design of the

604
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:03,020
network architecture they'll come out

605
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:08,139
with a is it's really pretty much the

606
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:08,139
second soul that's coming out for ICS

607
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:21,860
oh yes yeah we are all cleared

608
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:25,010
individuals from Idaho National Labs are

609
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:30,250
security bikers we all care the federal

610
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:30,250
clearances we're all pssc actor

611
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,240
the big one that most people get really

612
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,919
excited about is the national pet test

613
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,399
they thought the rest of mobility

614
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:47,070
analysis they will come out and do a

615
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:49,199
full-scale pen test it's usually takes

616
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:52,620
about two weeks first week is going to

617
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,090
be the constant basis and then after

618
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:56,610
that they'll start going and they'll

619
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:57,439
come on sunny and they'll actually start

620
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:59,998
employing

621
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,460
tactics to be able to get it very

622
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:04,529
similar to what we see in the animal

623
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:06,480
world they'll start taking screenshots

624
00:30:04,529 --> 00:30:09,960
I'll show you how they got it what they

625
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,789
did we share a lot of information and

626
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,740
resources with other federal

627
00:30:11,789 --> 00:30:16,139
partnerships so the guys are actually

628
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,399
really good at what they do but most of

629
00:30:16,139 --> 00:30:19,580
what they're gonna use is what's in the

630
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:21,779
wild they're having an issue with so

631
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:23,279
undefendable zero day everything like

632
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:26,190
that it's gonna be software that you can

633
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,809
get out of everywhere else it's nothing

634
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:29,490
you should be able to defend they're not

635
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:31,139
gonna be so sneaky the thing they want

636
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:34,320
to test your lenders and make sure that

637
00:30:31,139 --> 00:30:36,149
they're they're able to detect a lot of

638
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:40,110
things they're going blind so it won't

639
00:30:36,149 --> 00:30:41,340
be so covert it's not finessing and sit

640
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,209
down your net worth for three years

641
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,009
before they tell you

642
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:46,799
they did they're gonna connect with on

643
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:49,139
the tactics most of what you're gonna

644
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:53,330
see here is going to be an idea of

645
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:53,330
whether it can be doing Wilder outside

646
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:04,699
so anybody it's very said that there was

647
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:07,220
no state employees local employees

648
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:14,250
veterans in the room

649
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:18,180
great federal state local and veterans

650
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:21,030
have access to that DTE it's about 30 36

651
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:24,360
different courses there's 800 some five

652
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:27,770
hours of training and they're very well

653
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:30,209
kept up today I saw they updated

654
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:33,570
certified ethical hacker at version 10

655
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:35,340
and then of course it just showed up

656
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:39,480
they're called cyber dark arts I'm not

657
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:41,669
sure what that is but there's a lot of

658
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:44,100
different coursework on there as far as

659
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:46,500
cyber security that's free if you can

660
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:49,379
get in and off one of those let's put in

661
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:51,570
the email but in your official email or

662
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:54,670
go through a bed made me ask you CO

663
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:57,780
80204 teen or something but

664
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:57,780
is all that true

665
00:32:01,659 --> 00:32:06,559
stop thinkin x4 for everybody else it is

666
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:09,080
one of those sites to where we actually

667
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:11,509
go 300 try to that say it's security man

668
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:13,009
or secure the home you'll see that

669
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:14,720
there's going to be toolkits on here

670
00:32:13,009 --> 00:32:15,979
you'll see that we can target those

671
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,590
toolkits so if you have young children

672
00:32:15,979 --> 00:32:20,299
you want to be able to expand you want

673
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,840
then be able to have spam pages on the

674
00:32:20,299 --> 00:32:22,609
Internet

675
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:25,939
they're already focused towards that

676
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:27,049
they also keep a much shorter even for

677
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,759
adults per se they're profitable

678
00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:30,168
training times at three minutes that's

679
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:32,509
when your products my stop screen

680
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:34,700
Arianism so they go through they make

681
00:32:32,509 --> 00:32:36,879
everything tailored to the actual group

682
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:39,649
older Americans

683
00:32:36,879 --> 00:32:43,158
everybody's subject social security

684
00:32:39,649 --> 00:32:45,649
scans your nephews and a Tijuana prison

685
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:54,139
right now so they may focus in a lot of

686
00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:55,699
that as well as the sisters then again

687
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:58,080
there's this if you can navigate through

688
00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:00,179
these I'll say that one thing

689
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,710
I won't propose we don't think

690
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:03,809
everything's easy to find on these pages

691
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:05,640
can but there's a ton of resources on

692
00:33:03,809 --> 00:33:07,770
here outside justice abstracts recipes

693
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:10,170
so play over the page for fun a lot of

694
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:12,000
good things cybersecurity awareness is

695
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:14,340
next month and the place excited about

696
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,500
that DHS has been a sponsor

697
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:19,770
cybersecurity Awareness Month since it

698
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:21,360
was inception in 2002 this would be the

699
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:23,700
first year that is doing it in the

700
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,290
monitoring system so they've been trying

701
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,850
to give all a lot so we're gonna see

702
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:29,280
what this one's going to look like

703
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:31,350
everybody's got pretty high expectations

704
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,370
last year's you'll see the themes there

705
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,740
they're still available

706
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:38,189
go ahead start pulling off all the

707
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:40,860
posters flyers and documents that was

708
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:42,960
the page from last year I think 2017 to

709
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:45,719
fill out as well so you go pull all

710
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,520
those down sir most of the walls the

711
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,250
reading stoplights are security

712
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:53,929
awareness and all your things to the

713
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:53,929
local organization October

714
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:10,970
okay so it's in reporting the in tip

715
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:13,869
which is our operation center office a

716
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:17,000
picks for that year a second there

717
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:19,869
believe they could go through they can

718
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,969
start looking at and they can coordinate

719
00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:27,950
is a response to recovery whether that's

720
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:29,270
with Title 18 FBI the law enforcement it

721
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:32,418
doesn't matter who are critical of the

722
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:33,980
structure you call that number and they

723
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:36,830
will help you through with the only bit

724
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:41,570
of a ticket traffic stop trying to get

725
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:46,000
you resources you need a lot of times

726
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:49,190
whereas women report as soon as possibly

727
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,500
its financial fraud and the FBI certain

728
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:54,859
things they can do its wire fraud they

729
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:58,609
kill chain process has to be within 72

730
00:34:54,859 --> 00:35:00,859
hours most times people report never

731
00:34:58,609 --> 00:35:03,080
having options and resources and a lot

732
00:35:00,859 --> 00:35:05,420
of times that a lot of mechanism we have

733
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:09,220
a place to be able to recover some of

734
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:13,160
those those losses that already passed

735
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:14,899
it's unfortunate if you're part of

736
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,609
critical infrastructure when you call

737
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,860
the FBI it will try to help you

738
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:21,290
the can Vista Evans didn't kill Shane be

739
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:23,930
able to interact after that they're in a

740
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:26,600
criminal prosecution if your party

741
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:29,509
critical structure we call us we will go

742
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:31,400
through the Vincent response team we can

743
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:34,280
actually be a little bit more resource

744
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:36,020
to be able to go through and get you

745
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:41,600
back on your feet from the recovery

746
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:45,710
piece the 13 this is kind of what they

747
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:50,560
do our analysis a lot of the actual

748
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:50,560
forensics then we'll try to get you back

749
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:06,140
they will come out bubbly or they will

750
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:09,019
come outside and

751
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:15,618
through those the right side of the bed

752
00:36:09,019 --> 00:36:18,709
time at 6:00 Dover's flood this is the

753
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:21,369
end kick it's now called the SIOP so I

754
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:24,829
apologize that I've met David's like

755
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:26,589
PSYOP with any reorganization a new

756
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:29,739
organization and everything's changing

757
00:36:26,589 --> 00:36:32,058
simply ever not even a year old yet so

758
00:36:29,739 --> 00:36:35,480
learn how to miss manager punch it was

759
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:38,450
so fun but that sign off there for your

760
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:40,640
convenience it was assistant integrated

761
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:42,490
operations Coordination Center so they

762
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,830
embedded an acronym with

763
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:47,029
so if you have to sit there in front of

764
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:49,609
your mirrors the cybersecurity

765
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:52,820
instructor security agency created

766
00:36:49,609 --> 00:36:56,210
operations Coordination Center they were

767
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:59,300
there were times to be in that way but

768
00:36:56,210 --> 00:37:01,160
this is Nashua the building itself on

769
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,050
here since Maryland Homeland Security

770
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:06,259
and assistive personnel we have a

771
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:08,630
representation EMV sniper command

772
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:11,240
respect borders building we have three

773
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:18,590
letter agencies PLA CIA the Secret

774
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:20,540
Service the ice shack set up here not

775
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:21,440
information shared about information

776
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:25,400
sharing going on

777
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,060
it's done at a TS mic so they can't

778
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,520
share everything

779
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:30,080
one thing about Homeland Security is its

780
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,480
able to be shared you don't have to pull

781
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:35,299
a whole lot until the game lost

782
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,730
questions we don't want December 23rd

783
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:40,460
Ukrainian activity where black Energy's

784
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:43,310
shutting down power grids there's not a

785
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:47,869
whole lot for us so we will share that

786
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:50,600
information out members gets my snack I

787
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:55,010
encourage it that's how a lot of that

788
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:56,110
threat information is asked if you can

789
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:59,800
get

790
00:37:56,110 --> 00:38:01,990
in regards here at my office's they also

791
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,530
take a lot of information pass along as

792
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:05,049
well

793
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:07,090
so thread Intel is one of those things

794
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:09,430
it's very difficult to get into or very

795
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:12,130
expensive unit too so I encourage those

796
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:15,549
free organizations partnered with DHS

797
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:17,350
because a lot of that is generating this

798
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:20,980
friend expense just smarter than that

799
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:23,819
and around the farm and it's pretty

800
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:23,820
large facility

801
00:38:37,539 --> 00:38:43,749
so the question is is do they have

802
00:38:40,929 --> 00:38:46,299
classified phones that you can call into

803
00:38:43,749 --> 00:38:48,519
weather how does a speed which initiates

804
00:38:46,299 --> 00:38:50,589
at a higher level classification of

805
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:53,019
enough that initiates up an unclassified

806
00:38:50,589 --> 00:38:55,089
line or whether that they have secure

807
00:38:53,019 --> 00:38:57,098
lines like fibers may not appreciate the

808
00:38:55,089 --> 00:39:00,759
the answer to that is to call that

809
00:38:57,099 --> 00:39:07,029
number and to ask them because they they

810
00:39:00,759 --> 00:39:09,549
will provide to an environment the call

811
00:39:07,029 --> 00:39:10,929
center block right off that number and

812
00:39:09,549 --> 00:39:14,439
they will direct you to the office

813
00:39:10,929 --> 00:39:20,769
warehouse to hurt the same cast and they

814
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:23,348
will I believe needs to be everything

815
00:39:20,769 --> 00:39:25,479
that talked about a lot of those so

816
00:39:23,349 --> 00:39:27,399
again I encourage everybody take a photo

817
00:39:25,479 --> 00:39:29,468
these are resources that we have

818
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:32,759
available everything you go through you

819
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:32,759
can learn more about all of this

820
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:56,359
and if everybody just enjoyed listening

821
00:39:47,160 --> 00:40:04,009
to my smooth Indiana drop and talk to my

822
00:39:56,359 --> 00:40:07,619
advisor primarily perhaps the Kansas

823
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:09,930
I've been with this very Iowa and if

824
00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:12,960
you're across the river you actually

825
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:15,450
crossed over in through b25 mr. Tony

826
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:20,010
Enriquez in Chicago include his contact

827
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:21,569
up there and be calling in us we get you

828
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:24,510
to the right person

829
00:40:21,569 --> 00:40:27,210
also this number at the bottom goes to

830
