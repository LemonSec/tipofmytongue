2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:11,190

3
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:12,360

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:23,130
sorry I keep seeing people grab these

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,830
don't click on stickers and you

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:29,060
know my opinion of them so anyway

10
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:32,790
instead of just holding up the stickers

11
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:35,250
okay so again nitron take me to be here

12
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:38,339
now i tries a good company i've done my

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,559
job okay so let's talk about this

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,610
presentation this presentation is a

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,260
little bit more practical on

16
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:54,629
specifically how i think the problem is

17
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:57,089
those mics are still on okay now i kind

18
00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:03,839
of out talk john that's it

19
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:05,790
but just as i start talking I can hear

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,880
how bad it is

21
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,470
[Music]

22
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:15,020
they just want me to use a handheld and

23
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,020
unplug everything well it's up to you

24
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:29,419
this is like super sensitive how's that

25
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:32,450
I'll just go with this okay so let's

26
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:35,329
talk about so creating a human security

27
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:37,729
officer this essentially is a little bit

28
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:39,979
like I created this presentation before

29
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:42,470
I created the other one yesterday this

30
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:44,689
is more of a lower level type of issue

31
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:47,869
on how to implement what I spoke about

32
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:50,619
yesterday again at a lower level type of

33
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:52,939
thing now let me tell a story so

34
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:55,700
hopefully none of you heard the story or

35
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:57,318
else it gets boring but so one time I

36
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,299
was doing a penetration test like

37
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:01,130
physical espionage simulation where I

38
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:04,549
was working with an accomplice to

39
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:05,929
infiltrate a fortune 500 company and we

40
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:08,929
were in the middle of nowhere because

41
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:11,269
this is a nice fortune 500 company in

42
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:13,190
the middle of nowhere and they make

43
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:15,950
power generation systems and what

44
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:18,590
happened was we were supposed to just

45
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:20,450
see what we could do in a week and I

46
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,680
took my accomplice with me I go here's

47
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,780
the deal we're going to go into the

48
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,819
corporate headquarters and they're going

49
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,590
to have a big entranceway which is

50
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:30,530
probably about the size of this room and

51
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:32,299
the doors let's say where the screen is

52
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,859
and then they have the reception desk

53
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:36,260
pretty much where that table in the

54
00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:38,209
middle is and then there's a door over

55
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,548
there ironically right where that door

56
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:43,340
is where most employees would go to and

57
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:45,200
they go like from here directly to the

58
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,780
left and go in there and there's another

59
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,488
door there and you know behind the desk

60
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,799
so anyway I said here's what we're going

61
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:52,830
to do we're going to walk in and we're

62
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:54,750
going to just be

63
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,660
we act like we're talking we're going to

64
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,370
go straight to the door on the left and

65
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:01,650
we've just been an ignored receptionist

66
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,240
if she tries talking to us and then

67
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,520
we're going to go up an elevator so we

68
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,620
do that we go up there we go up an

69
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,870
elevator the elevator requires a swipe

70
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,240
and by everybody it's morning rush hour

71
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,730
everybody's swiping pretty much every

72
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:18,060
button was pushed so we end up going on

73
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:19,200
the second floor and I said we're just

74
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,570
going to try and find an empty

75
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,859
conference room so we get the empty

76
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:25,680
conference room

77
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,810
and what happened was we sit there then

78
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,510
I pick up my telephone and pick up the

79
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,910
phone in the conference room I go hi I'm

80
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,950
the CIO and I need some contractors to

81
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:37,079
get badges where I said oh my god

82
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,670
transfer around a couple times finally

83
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,220
somebody picks up and says send them

84
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:43,140
down to the front desk so anyway we go

85
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,790
down me and my accomplice go down to the

86
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,640
front desk nice woman there and she's

87
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:50,670
like I saw you to go by and I tried to

88
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,410
stop you I'm like oh I'm sorry we were

89
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,660
talk she's like oh you look busy don't

90
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:57,359
worry about it am i thanks angry and

91
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,490
then so finally the woman says okay you

92
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,040
need badges Jenna go yes we do so she

93
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:04,200
gets on the phone call somebody up and a

94
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,970
guard comes over she tells the guard

95
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,310
these gentlemen need badges and the

96
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,140
guards like okay and the guard takes us

97
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,600
to a room ironically where that door

98
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,549
would approximately be and we go in the

99
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,170
guard room and we're getting our

100
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:18,780
pictures taken and then we're sitting

101
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:20,489
there and then the guard goes oh that's

102
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:22,739
where you know we get the pictures it's

103
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:25,109
an HR D card you know one of those swipe

104
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,810
cards and the guard goes so what do you

105
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,670
two do I oh we do computer stuff she's

106
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,820
like oh do you need access to the server

107
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:34,740
room I go as a matter of fact we do so

108
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,900
anyway she's like well I'll head back to

109
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,120
the server room access I'll give you

110
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,630
server room access you know it might

111
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,340
take a couple hours

112
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:45,130
you know but it'll be there by lunchtime

113
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:47,140
like okay we can wait so anyway we go

114
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:49,030
ahead we wait around till lunchtime

115
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:51,849
which is you know usually a good time

116
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,320
because we try to infiltrate an area

117
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,060
when nobody's going to be there and

118
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,099
lunch is as good a time as any

119
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,960
so anyway to go to the money you know

120
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,060
lunch hour we just walk around the

121
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,000
basement swiping the card to see which

122
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:06,430
door opens up and then finally we find

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,870
the door that opens up we look in there

124
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,360
and then there's a whole bunch of

125
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:13,060
systems turned on one was apparently the

126
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,880
windows primary domain controller we had

127
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,470
a new admin user to the system and then

128
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,330
we've renamed it to something innocuous

129
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,280
so pretty much then we had pretty

130
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,620
control over the company's entire

131
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,440
network and that was kind of fun and

132
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:29,350
easy into to date so far it's I'm sorry

133
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:32,020
two hours so then what happened was you

134
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:34,150
know finish the test which is fairly you

135
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,979
know and that was just a sampling of you

136
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:39,820
know something but obviously important

137
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:42,340
so then what happens is we get a call

138
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,080
I'm like walking around like I'm home

139
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,729
and everything and I get a call about

140
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,680
three weeks later it's like I'm the

141
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,030
physical security manager and I need to

142
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,240
know the name of the garbin gave me the

143
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:54,429
badge like excuse me so I belong the

144
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,020
manager of the physical security manager

145
00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:00,940
these buildings I need to know which car

146
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:02,740
taking the badge I go there's a couple

147
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:05,169
problems with what you're saying right

148
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,720
now say why me the name I'm not giving

149
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:09,280

150
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,910
me the name I run the facilities I know

151
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,888
here's the problem I don't have a clue

152
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:18,160
and you know I go I'm from New York I

153
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:19,509
don't get no kids here okay I go sorry

154
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,030
the guy was getting on my nerves I don't

155
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:24,610
give an F about who you really are I

156
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:28,900
know the only person I report to is the

157
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:31,600
CIO if the CIO calls me up and I confirm

158
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:33,760
his identity I would and he asked before

159
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,370
I will give him the name of the guard

160
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,710
I know however you should be warned that

161
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:41,590
and when I give him the name of the

162
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:43,388
guard if asked I will also let you know

163
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:45,698
that the fact this guard gave me the

164
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:48,210
badge is bad the fact you don't know who

165
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:52,449
that guard is is infinitely worse

166
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:53,979
because think about it this way you know

167
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:57,490
everybody thinks the guards kind of an

168
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:59,680
idiot right the problem is not the guard

169
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:02,320
because I think if the guard you know I

170
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,090
didn't even write it the reason I you

171
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,409
know I don't usually put names in there

172
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,020
unless there's something clearly wrong

173
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:10,270
in my opinion the guard did nothing

174
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:12,460
wrong and the reason is what is the

175
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:15,698
process for that company to give out

176
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:18,820
badge and sensitive access I have no

177
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:21,280
clue but apparently in practice the

178
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:24,620
process was you talk to the nice

179
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,559
receptionist the nice receptionist says

180
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:29,420
they get a badge and if they one extra

181
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,980
access they just ask the guard for the

182
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,590
access and that's all you need

183
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,090
there was no authorization process for

184
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,950
restricted areas

185
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:38,859
there was no authorization process for

186
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:41,599
packages beyond convincing the

187
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:44,720
receptionist you're a nice person that

188
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:47,390
was all that was required and everybody

189
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,270
who thinks the guard is an idiot is the

190
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:52,039
idiot themselves because you have to

191
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,289
stop and think and again this whole you

192
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,570
know don't click on stickers that's

193
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:58,190
going around out there the problem is

194
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:00,250
not that people click on the

195
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,420
publisher giving people to click

196
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:05,690
that's the problem

197
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:07,850
you can't blame people for clicking on

198
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:11,510
stuff that's sitting in their corporate

199
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:14,390
inboxes you have allowed that to get

200
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:17,599
there that's the fundamental issues

201
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:20,000
likewise the guard did nothing wrong

202
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,100
because that's the process they came to

203
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,640
guard the ability to add access to any

204
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:28,610
room frankly in the entire fortune 500

205
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:31,130
company that's a significant problem if

206
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:33,110
I said I eat access to the CEOs office I

207
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,450
could have got access to the CEOs office

208
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,280
maybe she was help I might you to check

209
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,100
on that but to literally there's no

210
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,780
process there's no document anybody

211
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,960
could point me to that said that guard

212
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:47,689
violated any process or procedure so

213
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:50,210
anyway coming along is that fern

214
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,980
annoying I mean we're not quite between

215
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:55,340
two ferns this is actually supposed to

216
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:57,320
be a presentation so anyway the human

217
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:59,090
and you know generally you know going

218
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,550
back to a little bit of a presentation

219
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:03,740
yesterday with some overlap everybody

220
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:06,319
thinks the problem is the human is the

221
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:08,090
weakest link that no matter what happens

222
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,940
you could put a perfect security program

223
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:13,640
together and inevitably a user can fail

224
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,240
and your whole security program fails

225
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,189
because that user fail

226
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,589
and then clearly the solution for your

227
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:22,080
whole security program is to just give

228
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:24,600
that person better awareness it's so

229
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,220
obvious right and then of course people

230
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,529
do that they're like we're going to get

231
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,200
funnier videos because funnier videos

232
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:33,149
they might remember until the end of the

233
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,980
day as opposed to until the end of the

234
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:36,540
questions we asked or something like

235
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,279
that but it's like we're gonna have

236
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,990
funny videos in that thing you know so

237
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:41,700
what happens you know there's a whole

238
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,290
scientific concept of the forgetting

239
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,690
current which means pretty much they

240
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:48,510
forgot it by the time you said anything

241
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:50,670
and nothing changes and but of course

242
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:53,490
it's the stupid user who's the problem

243
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:56,729
anyway the reality successful attacks

244
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:58,680
against users are grouped an example of

245
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:01,830
a systemic failing throughout your

246
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:04,560
entire organization again for a user to

247
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:07,980
click on and ruin your network that

248
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,859
means that your network sucks that's a

249
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:13,920
given that somehow you have led and

250
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:16,140
obviously a stupid user you have left

251
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,060
that stupid user enough access and

252
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,370
enough permissions to ruin your network

253
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,560
that means you're the stupid one there

254
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,149
so again remember behind every stupid

255
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,550
user is a stupid or security

256
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:28,529
professional at least usually usually I

257
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:29,699
should say there are some users out

258
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:32,010
there I swear if you send them a

259
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,230
phishing message that says if you click

260
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:37,529
on this message it will ruin the network

261
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:40,290
they will click on that message about 3%

262
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:44,160
of people will click on that message but

263
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:47,310
again we've got to expect that no matter

264
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,920
what so anyway and security team here's

265
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:52,020
the problem security teams are or

266
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,459
actually let me cover that other part

267
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,470
which I kind of covered yesterday but

268
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:56,420
for those who are here basically

269
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,950
technology

270
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:01,709
awareness are treated as separate silos

271
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:03,390
so for example with a fishing problem

272
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,860
you had one group of people like the

273
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:07,080
technologists that say well we need to

274
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,060
buy cement bales filtering software

275
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,040
we're going to do that then you have

276
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,599
some people who work in governance it's

277
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,089
like well we have to write policies and

278
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,250
procedures will write them we finish

279
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:18,870
them ok now we submit them put them on

280
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,300
the shelves until the auditors show up

281
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,980
once a year and but we've done our job

282
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,390
and then you have another group of

283
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,850
people working awareness and these

284
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:29,340
awareness people are saying oh my job is

285
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:31,290
to give people funny videos or something

286
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:34,200
like that so basically you have three

287
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:36,180
different people all tackling what is

288
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,000
essentially the same problem working

289
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:41,040
completely independently and not caring

290
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,930
what the other people are doing not

291
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,900
trying to work together in any way shape

292
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:47,640
or form but then you have security teams

293
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,980
and like I spoke about yesterday

294
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,380
they're afraid to change the

295
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,880
organisation you know I realized like oh

296
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,560
we don't want to you know we don't want

297
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,990
to blame anybody we don't want to do

298
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,880
anything you know oh we don't want to

299
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:01,950
have penalties because we can't blame

300
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,290
the users or anything like that we don't

301
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:07,320
want to enforce anything and it's like

302
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:09,030
you can blame the user how many people

303
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,760
heard the expression you can't blame the

304
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:15,000
user if the user does something really

305
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,680
stupid you can blame the user because

306
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,860
think about it this way how many

307
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:22,410
organizations but have didn't major was

308
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:25,320
I anybody traveled here or something

309
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:27,180
like that okay a couple people if you

310
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,310
haven't travel for your organization or

311
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:31,859
actually let's just do time cards you

312
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:34,079
all work for an organization and most

313
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:36,150
people have to confirm the hours that

314
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,520
they work if you take days off or

315
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:41,730
something like that stop and consider

316
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:44,100
what happens if you don't properly fill

317
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:48,660
in the system for your time properly do

318
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,920
you get paid does anybody say hey oh we

319
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,230
don't want to blame you

320
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,108
we can punish the user for not entering

321
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:57,029
their time properly no you enter your

322
00:12:55,109 --> 00:12:59,429
time properly or you don't get paid

323
00:12:57,029 --> 00:13:01,499
there's no question about that that's a

324
00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:03,449
lot less fair in my mind that just

325
00:13:01,499 --> 00:13:05,189
having somebody you know it's helping

326
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,599
somebody oh well you're kind of got to

327
00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:09,179
sit through extra training because you

328
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,559
screwed up the entire network I mean so

329
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:12,600
Mike looks at pornography and their

330
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,249
company they get fired some of my goes

331
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,869
ahead and ruins the network so don't

332
00:13:14,249 --> 00:13:18,419
like look at pornography they just get

333
00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:20,879
please don't do that again that's not

334
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:22,889
the right way to do things but anyway

335
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:24,749
security teams are afraid you know

336
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:27,419
they're treated like the bastard child

337
00:13:24,749 --> 00:13:29,429
and if that's your attitude you deserve

338
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:31,619
to be treated like the bastard child if

339
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:33,959
you're not going to do anything actively

340
00:13:31,619 --> 00:13:35,669
for the organization now let me take a

341
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:38,549
step back and say awareness isn't

342
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:40,769
perfect you know even if you had perfect

343
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:42,959
awareness even if you get everybody to

344
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:45,089
do everything it's not going to hit

345
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:47,219
everybody because here's the thing

346
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:49,470
people don't realize when you do an

347
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:52,619
awareness program your goal should not

348
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:55,139
be I am going to make everybody really

349
00:13:52,619 --> 00:13:56,970
aware you know it's kind of like a risk

350
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:59,429
it's like all security countermeasures

351
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,259
security countermeasures again how many

352
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:03,689
people are security professionals or

353
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:06,239
whatever of and you're all failures

354
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:07,949
I mean definition of security is being

355
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:10,649
free from risk you're never free from

356
00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:11,969
risk your risk management people if

357
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:14,249
you're doing your job right you're

358
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:16,829
balancing potential losses against the

359
00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:19,350
resources that you have that's your job

360
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:22,049
and no matter what awareness is not a

361
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:24,329
perfect countermeasure oh you know and

362
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:26,790
never I oh well awareness programs suck

363
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:29,309
it's like how many encryption programs

364
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:31,559
fail and again the only reason that

365
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:33,149
people can demonstrate a failure of

366
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:35,399
awareness is because all the other

367
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:38,610
technology has failed and as I've

368
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:41,339
presented the user with to click on

369
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:42,160
according to the speakers out here so

370
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:43,930
those are the issue

371
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,850
I'm trying to find a place where I'm not

372
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:48,189
echoing but that's not working

373
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,060
so anyway awareness isn't perfect but

374
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,500
here's the problem

375
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,779
most emergence programs are not

376
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,850
awareness programs most awareness

377
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:56,740
programs are training programs and it

378
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:59,290
makes a big difference if you've never

379
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:03,069
read probably only person who ever read

380
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:04,959
this 800 - 50 actually defines security

381
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:08,019
awareness programs training and things

382
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,180
like that the definition of training is

383
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:12,850
providing people with a fixed body of

384
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:14,829
knowledge maybe testing them on it the

385
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:17,259
definition of awareness is changing

386
00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:20,170
behaviors your role for awareness

387
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:22,360
programs is to change behaviors you know

388
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:24,490
compliance programs maybe you have to

389
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,529
show did you give people to require

390
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:28,839
training it's not did you give people

391
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:31,180
the employer required awareness as did

392
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:33,069
you provide something you could show an

393
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,959
auditor at the end of the year that's

394
00:15:33,069 --> 00:15:36,878
what a training program is and that's

395
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,979
essentially what most people defuse an

396
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:41,019
awareness program with so when most

397
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,850
people say oh we've got really funny

398
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:44,350
videos so that's gonna stop the problems

399
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:46,389
like now you've got really funny videos

400
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:48,040
that go into learning management system

401
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:49,630
so you could show the auditors at the

402
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:53,019
end of the year could show them videos

403
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:55,569
that nobody actually cares about so

404
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:58,389
that's kind of the biggest problem and

405
00:15:55,569 --> 00:16:00,699
phishing simulations you know there's

406
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:02,709
some benefit I talked to people who do

407
00:16:00,699 --> 00:16:04,359
phishing simulations some are better

408
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:06,040
than others I work with different

409
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,329
organizations that have good ones

410
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,000
different companies have better

411
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:11,810
solutions or worse solutions but the

412
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,150
situation is

413
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:16,609
simulations generally train people on

414
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:18,800
detecting fishing simulations more than

415
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:20,900
they detect on real fishing messages

416
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,300
because the worst part is when I see a

417
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:25,370
company highlight you know after

418
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:28,250
watching our training I was afraid to

419
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:30,050
open up my email I'm like oh god you

420
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,930
should fire the company who said that

421
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:35,390
and why because your job is to train

422
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:37,939
people how to do their jobs safely and

423
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:40,939
confidently your job isn't scaring

424
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:42,740
people away from doing their job and

425
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,750
checking email as part of their job

426
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:47,210
clicking on is part of that job

427
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:49,339
you've got to go ahead and train people

428
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:51,920
how to do that aspect of their job

429
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:54,140
properly generate the right behaviors

430
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,390
and the most efficient simulations some

431
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:58,069
fishing simulations can be good but most

432
00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:00,290
fishing simulations are just there to

433
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:02,300
get people from a 20% click rate down to

434
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:04,280
zero and when you get people down to a

435
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,879
0% click rate it means you're probably

436
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:09,859
getting really superficial messages and

437
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,010
you're not you're not improving

438
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:14,179
awareness in any level after that

439
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:16,400
because if you're doing a good warez

440
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:18,800
program of fishing simulation program

441
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,540
you should constantly up and increase

442
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,780
the level of sophistication of your

443
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:26,178
messages so that training and awareness

444
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:28,040
increases as time goes on again you know

445
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:30,170
send people to computer you know you

446
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,730
don't get a computer science major and

447
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:33,710
say ok we're going to keep giving you

448
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:36,050
computer science 101 until you get a

449
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:38,720
hundred percent on your test no you give

450
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:41,210
people computer science 101 maybe they

451
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:45,800
get somewhere between a hundred and a 70

452
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:47,660
or endlessness so get 170 ideally 70 to

453
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,850
100 and then they take computer science

454
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:52,220
102 and then they get somewhere between

455
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:54,439
a 70 and 100 and then they take a few

456
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,820
science 201 or whatever you

457
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,350
keep increasing their knowledge you'll

458
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,600
try to get everybody down up to a

459
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:02,149
hundred before and then leave them there

460
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,850
and the basic program you keep upping

461
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:08,000
the level of information as time goes on

462
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:10,158
that's what's critical so now here's the

463
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,070
other aspect even smart people make

464
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:15,679
mistakes I have how many of you are

465
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:18,110
Union sevens or any point in time works

466
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,899
you miss how many who have accidentally

467
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:23,389
hit RM star dot star dot star minus RI

468
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:25,250
minus R star dot star that star in the

469
00:18:23,389 --> 00:18:26,779
wrong directory you know you thought you

470
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:29,149
were in one directory it's like oh that

471
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:31,159
was a mistake and then you hope that

472
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:34,008
somebody did backups at some point in

473
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:35,779
the recent future I have done that I've

474
00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:37,610
accidentally clicked on things I

475
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:39,860
shouldn't have clicked on and why did I

476
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:41,899
do that because sometimes the system was

477
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:44,240
just running slowly to give a point in

478
00:18:41,899 --> 00:18:45,739
time and the cursor wasn't the clerk the

479
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,480
computer thought the cursor was

480
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,399
someplace different than where the

481
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,799
cursor actually was which happens on a

482
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:53,719
frequent basis there's a lot of things

483
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:55,970
that happen you're never going to get

484
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:58,759
any user at any given time to be a

485
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:01,340
hundred percent perfect you know they

486
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:03,169
can be mostly perfect they can even know

487
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,539
what the right thing is there's another

488
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:07,580
concept in psychic wealth psychology

489
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:09,799
compliance called the compliance budget

490
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:12,230
or the compliance budget means is I

491
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:15,408
might know exactly what I should be

492
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:17,690
doing I might really want to do it but

493
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:19,970
there might be something at a different

494
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,620
point in time that has you do something

495
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:24,379
differently and let me give a good

496
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,610
example especially around my area and I

497
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:29,240
think it's pretty much the same

498
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:31,580
everywhere else how many people put

499
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,500
their kids in childcare at some point in

500
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:35,899
time or another put your kids in

501
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:38,809
childcare and you have to pick your kid

502
00:19:35,899 --> 00:19:41,268
up at a given time and the childcare

503
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:43,220
companies know they don't want the kids

504
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:44,240
just sitting around thinking well you're

505
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,669
just right lady

506
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,610
no big deal they define you like five

507
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:49,410
dollars and then

508
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,879
or something like that I don't know how

509
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:53,070
many people have to see all of that but

510
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,110
in my area there are people who are

511
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,370
going to run other kids over just to

512
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:58,260
make sure they get to the childcare

513
00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:00,149
center by you know so they don't have to

514
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,460
pay you five dollars a minute fine and

515
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:04,350
these people are like you know what I

516
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,450
know I should let my desk at the end of

517
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:08,250
the day I know I should put all my stuff

518
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:10,860
away I know I should turn off my

519
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:13,650
computer but what happens it's like

520
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:15,719
right at a certain time and they know

521
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:17,250
they don't get out they're not going to

522
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,260
they're going to be fine five dollars a

523
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,390
minute so screw whatever the positive

524
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,890
process is for locking up their stuff

525
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:25,350
they're going to get out because there's

526
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:27,210
another competing issue likewise you

527
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:29,219
might want to do the same thing you know

528
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:31,140
we might have other requirements but you

529
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,600
might have the work deadlines not

530
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:35,040
personal the work deadlines and if you

531
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,020
don't get something out of it given

532
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,940
point in time you're going to go ahead

533
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:40,830
and do it for example how do people know

534
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,470
they should do backups at a given point

535
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:45,720
in time every week or whatever and then

536
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:47,429
how many people don't do those backups

537
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,880
because there are other more seemingly

538
00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:52,530
pressing issues that come up why because

539
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,960
backups you really don't need them very

540
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:56,879
frequently in all honesty but then when

541
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,650
you do need them then you're screwed but

542
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,350
again it's a little bit like crying wolf

543
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:03,990
but you know you should but you don't so

544
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:06,120
anyway some attacks are well-crafted so

545
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:08,730
I'd be fed to death okay so now you have

546
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,379
technical countermeasures and again like

547
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:12,120
I've already mentioned technical

548
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,970
countermeasures aren't perfect because

549
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:17,610
again if people have to click on it

550
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:19,410
meant you did not do your job because

551
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,340
you will have the to get to their

552
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:24,100
game box so anyway

553
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:26,679
families so let's talk about how you can

554
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:28,240
potentially examine like as yesterday

555
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,540
spoke about in the grand scheme of

556
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,060
things stepping through the process of

557
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:36,280
ensuring that the analyze an attack you

558
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,780
know and I just did at a high level that

559
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,970
you have to figure out how an attack

560
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:42,940
would get to the user how a user reacts

561
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:45,400
to the attack and then how to respond to

562
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:47,140
the attack if it's successful so anyway

563
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,930
there's a whole concept of kill chain

564
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:52,210
and I'm not talking about the cyber kill

565
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:54,460
chain because you know that really is

566
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:56,590
just relevant for malware I'm talking

567
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:59,230
about military kill chain principals at

568
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:01,449
a high level with military kill chains

569
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:03,520
it basically is the acknowledgment that

570
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:06,640
there are many phases of an attack and

571
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,400
every phase of an attack is a moving the

572
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,710
attack forward but likewise it's a point

573
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,930
in time or a point during the attack

574
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:16,480
where you can first detect the attack

575
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:18,760
and prevent the attack from moving

576
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,920
forward ideally you don't have to

577
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,780
respond to a point in time of the attack

578
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,400
but it's basically stepping through

579
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:27,639
figuring out where you can detect it

580
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,470
prevent it and so on but again each

581
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,660
phase in the kill chain is the

582
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:33,880
adversaries kill chain but it's also an

583
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:37,060
opportunity for you to kill the attack

584
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:39,220
in progress so a traditional kill chain

585
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:41,169
generally of the phases of an attack and

586
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:44,470
this is more of a military type of

587
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:47,590
common terminology where you find a

588
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:49,780
potential target so for example if we

589
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:51,520
talk about let's just say an aircraft

590
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:54,550
carrier in the middle of an ocean

591
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:57,250
now generally aircraft carrier strike

592
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:59,110
groups are pretty big but the oceans

593
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,760
even bigger so sometimes it's hard to

594
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:03,070
find them if you don't have good signals

595
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,000
intelligence or whatever so you got to

596
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:06,220
go ahead and say

597
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,870
let's say Russia I would say let's say

598
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,610
the US wants to blow up a Russian

599
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:11,590
aircraft carrier but the way to do that

600
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:14,979
is just let the aircraft carrier itself

601
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:17,199
go for Russia but you know for us and

602
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,540
want to blow up the US aircraft carrier

603
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,540
somebody has to basically be able to

604
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:24,610
first find the aircraft carrier and then

605
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:26,350
so the first thing is they Russia has to

606
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:28,240
say okay there's a carrier Strike Group

607
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:29,949
somewhere in the middle of Pacific we

608
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,350
don't like it they're coming close to

609
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:34,480
Petropavlovsk and Vladivostok whatever

610
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:36,520
the case is and we want to figure out

611
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,620
where it is so we can blow it up before

612
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,710
it gets within striking range of our

613
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:43,659
bases in Petropavlovsk or whatever so

614
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:45,280
anyway the phases of an attack first you

615
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:48,430
have to find where the Carrier Strike

616
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:51,100
Group is and it's like okay I think I

617
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:53,260
found it now you have to go ahead and

618
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:55,600
you have to get a more specific accurate

619
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:57,970
fix on it so we said okay it's within

620
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,159
this area in the general ocean now we

621
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:01,780
have a high level fix on where it is so

622
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,090
we're going to start sending the Bombers

623
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:06,310
out and start figuring out how to go

624
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:08,110
ahead and target that then we're going

625
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:10,240
to go ahead now we got a more specific

626
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:12,699
lock on it so now we're going to track

627
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,710
it and then at some point in time we're

628
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,720
tracking it and we're like okay now

629
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:18,400
we've developed a specific target and

630
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,260
then we've got to get the order to

631
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,240
engage in other words we know exactly

632
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:24,160
where the counter is now we got to go

633
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,260
ahead and engage it in other words we

634
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,750
fixated and we're going to engage and

635
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:31,180
overshoot it and then we got to go ahead

636
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:33,190
and assess the damage for it so for

637
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,990
example if you send a hypersonic missile

638
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:37,300
at an aircraft carrier did you hit the

639
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:39,670
aircraft carrier is the aircraft carrier

640
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:41,620
sunk or maybe is it still functional

641
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:44,500
can it be towed or whatever do we need a

642
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:46,570
secondary attack on it so that at a high

643
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:49,800
level is how a kill chain theoretically

644
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:53,740
works at a general attack in progress

645
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:55,960
now traditional adversary activity they

646
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:58,120
got to identify the targets and this is

647
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,039
kind of where it's getting more relevant

648
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,779
for the sniper kill chain the cyber kill

649
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:04,029
chain again is really just a malware

650
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:05,470
type of targeting thing but you know

651
00:25:04,029 --> 00:25:08,020
generally when I say target

652
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:10,240
identification at a high level it's

653
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:11,950
something along the lines of I want to

654
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,350
target

655
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:16,570
let's stop talking you know military and

656
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:19,029
intelligence let's just say I want to

657
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:20,379
steal money from Target like I mean

658
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:22,539
that's already been done so it makes it

659
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:24,760
easy knowing thing so anyway I want to

660
00:25:22,539 --> 00:25:27,400
start identifying target how am I going

661
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:30,190
to get into target you know force this

662
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:32,020
patch in other words how can I get in so

663
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:33,850
I'm going to start probing target and

664
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:36,100
then I realize you know something I

665
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:37,928
think the vendor network is the easiest

666
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:40,149
way to get into target so I'm going to

667
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:42,700
start sending phishing messages out to

668
00:25:40,149 --> 00:25:44,649
the target vendors now I have the

669
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:46,120
phishing messages out to the Pender's I

670
00:25:44,649 --> 00:25:48,399
have established a foothold on the

671
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:50,590
network now that I have a foothold on

672
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:52,149
the network I'm going to go ahead and

673
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:54,279
I'm going to start the attack in other

674
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:55,959
words for target specifically I'm going

675
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:58,330
to go ahead and I'm going to load

676
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,730
malware on the target configuration

677
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:02,740
management system so in other words the

678
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:05,260
target configuration management system

679
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:07,630
is what sent the malware automatically

680
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:09,580
these target zone resources to send now

681
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:12,159
where to all the target point-of-sale

682
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:15,250
systems so then they went ahead send the

683
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,799
stuff out and destruction of target in

684
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:20,529
this case they included the net target

685
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:22,389
target yet I just realized how ironic I

686
00:26:20,529 --> 00:26:24,640
just could make the title of the company

687
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:27,250
but anyway so it happens to capture

688
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,440
information so in other words in or in

689
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:31,240
this case it was like okay we want us on

690
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,779
the point-of-sale systems we want to

691
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:36,100
steal the swipes so we can get the

692
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:38,260
credit card numbers and all the

693
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,629
information on the credit card so that's

694
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,110
what they did in that case destruction

695
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:43,540
or

696
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:45,549
tration of system simultaneously not

697
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:47,620
only did they capture credit card swipes

698
00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:49,840
off the system they compromised the

699
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:52,090
target back-end systems like the target

700
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,159
red card system a lot I'm not sure how

701
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:55,928
many people know that target is one of

702
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,490
the largest credit card issuers in the

703
00:26:55,929 --> 00:26:59,620
world because they have to target red

704
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:01,600
card and I think this forty million on a

705
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:03,370
red card holder so that gave the

706
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,899
criminals lots of information that way

707
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:08,080
but that was another example of

708
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:11,140
destruction now here's the thing over

709
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:13,840
time the human has become the choice

710
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:16,690
attack vector for people get a 90

711
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:19,418
percent of all attacks are targeting

712
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:21,910
users or sorry humans in one way or

713
00:27:19,419 --> 00:27:24,070
another as the primary attack therefore

714
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:27,010
in other words how am I going to get

715
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:29,590
access to the target and organization

716
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:31,120
and it became the vector of choice and

717
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:34,149
why is it the vector choice is it

718
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,360
because people are stupid kind of but

719
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:39,429
more importantly not only are people

720
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:44,250
let's just say less reliable than our

721
00:27:39,429 --> 00:27:47,020
technology your companies really suck at

722
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:49,750
acknowledging and securing around that

723
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:51,160
vulnerable piece you know you do for

724
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:53,799
example that there was a mainframe

725
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:55,320
computer and all mainframe computers

726
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:57,370
were really kept very vulnerable

727
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,439
everybody would be targeting mainframe

728
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:02,189
computers if you knew for example all

729
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:06,429
these companies use what's a good one

730
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:08,140
should I compete should I aim now you

731
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:10,750
know let's just say for example a lot of

732
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:12,610
companies are using CloudFlare and you

733
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:14,970
know CloudFlare is a vulnerable attack

734
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:17,459
vector everybody's going to try to get

735
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:19,320
accounts and stuff like that so anyway

736
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,840
that's part of the issue again it's the

737
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,639
poor controls around the user that are

738
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,590
the bigger issues than the users

739
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:29,220
themselves because organizations

740
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:32,100
generally don't protect users from doing

741
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:33,840
a user stuff and that's the biggest

742
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:36,120
problem so again they assume the

743
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,220
organization you know they already

744
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:40,020
assume it and what they do is they

745
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:43,200
determine who are the best people to

746
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:45,000
target at a point in time and Linkedin

747
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,590
and all these other social networks are

748
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,240
really great these days of providing

749
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:49,740
companies with our attackers with a

750
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,940
shopping list of what they want to do

751
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:56,520
that in the case of in the case of cyber

752
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:58,590
attacks you know what are the potential

753
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,900
execute you know what that's essentially

754
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:03,030
what apps do the criminals potentially

755
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,770
want to perpetrate I guess they list

756
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:06,870
there and maybe you want to execute

757
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:09,150
actions in other words perhaps you want

758
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:11,250
to target a network at a foothold so you

759
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:14,400
can use that network to target somebody

760
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:17,010
else again much in the same way that the

761
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,960
criminal who targeted target they

762
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:20,940
basically went ahead and targeted a

763
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,220
vendor network and the vendor was

764
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,260
basically just a third party that had

765
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,240
access to the intended target so that

766
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:29,460
was another issue you might just want to

767
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,290
collect information such as credit cards

768
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:33,660
and that's one issue you might want to

769
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:35,700
destroy information again if you want to

770
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:37,500
like these ransomware attacks and

771
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,850
holding people hostage is that a case of

772
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,520
where people just want to destroy

773
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:43,560
information and stuff like that implant

774
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,120
listening devices such as spyware

775
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:47,580
there's a lot of cases where people

776
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:50,070
plant spyware on people they don't like

777
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:52,399
they have cell phones too term cell

778
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:55,139
phones into listening devices and so on

779
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:58,020
anyway each attack has its own kill

780
00:29:55,140 --> 00:30:00,530
chain what I mean by that is you know at

781
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,530
a high level

782
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:05,668
like an attack isn't this I'm a human

783
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:08,009
and I'm gonna target a given company

784
00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:10,590
what I mean by that is every type of

785
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:12,870
attack for example that if you're going

786
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:15,090
to like have a physical security attack

787
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:17,008
that has one kill chain if you have a

788
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:19,769
phishing attack that's another one if

789
00:30:17,009 --> 00:30:21,899
you do a USB drop that's another type of

790
00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:23,249
kill chain and so on because if I'm

791
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:25,799
didn't like look at the kill chain

792
00:30:23,249 --> 00:30:27,720
through a USB Drive is like okay I've

793
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:30,450
got to look for where am I going to drop

794
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:32,700
USB drives and then I gotta figure out

795
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:34,980
okay where are people from the company

796
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,779
likely on a beach that I do the parking

797
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,669
lot you know on perhaps if I do a

798
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:40,559
parking lot that could you know if it's

799
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:43,230
a shared facility might not be the best

800
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,820
thing if I know for example the CEO is

801
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:47,940
in a given area maybe I'm going to go

802
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:51,480
ahead go to CEOs home and Target and

803
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:53,220
drop a USB Drive right by his card or

804
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,080
something like that to see if he finds

805
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:57,299
it or something that might be a more

806
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:59,369
specific way but that's a different type

807
00:30:57,299 --> 00:31:02,759
of kill chain than fishing kill chain as

808
00:30:59,369 --> 00:31:05,100
an example so here's the thing policies

809
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:07,559
procedures guidelines have to be

810
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,299
identified for each of these kill chains

811
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:12,450
in other words are at each of these

812
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:14,519
types of attacks and you guys say okay

813
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:16,710
USB truck you're saying that USBs

814
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:19,980
requirement policies and procedures yes

815
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:21,779
fishing requires its own yes you know

816
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,909
somebody tailgating an inside an

817
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:25,259
organization to get physical access yes

818
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:27,389
you need different policies and

819
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:29,999
procedures for that as well but

820
00:31:27,389 --> 00:31:31,918
technology also has to be implemented

821
00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:34,409
because here's one of the problems with

822
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:36,749
human based attacks too many people

823
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:39,480
think that I'm going to try to secure a

824
00:31:36,749 --> 00:31:40,259
user I'm going to focus on the user and

825
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,840
figure that out

826
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:45,450
I want to use technology so that the

827
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:48,449
user doesn't have a choice for example

828
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:50,970
if you remove USB drives from computers

829
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:53,130
you eliminate the possibility

830
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:55,200
to find a USB Drive and stick it in a

831
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:57,900
computer I work with one company that

832
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,909
took superglue and squirted in every USB

833
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:02,610
thing and they said if you need the USB

834
00:31:59,909 --> 00:32:04,980
act if you need to plug a USB into any

835
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:06,629
of your devices we only have one

836
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:08,820
computer and you have to bring it to the

837
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:10,530
admins and the admins have to scan

838
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:12,870
anything you're gonna do cuz even for

839
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:14,940
example picture frames people have put

840
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:16,168
malware you must be picture frames and

841
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:18,720
stuff like that so you have to be

842
00:32:16,169 --> 00:32:20,909
concerned about anyway let's talk

843
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,280
specifically about fishing ones

844
00:32:20,909 --> 00:32:25,080
regarding fishing because it's one of

845
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,950
the easiest ways because everybody

846
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,168
thinks ok

847
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:30,299
some idiot clicks on a fishing mask a

848
00:32:28,169 --> 00:32:31,950
joke and kids started walking in I'm

849
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:33,690
just going to pretend just going to hold

850
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:36,630
this up so now you know what I mean

851
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:39,330
ok everybody knows the boat right ok so

852
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:42,240
anyway so everybody thinks ok users are

853
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:44,879
clicking on stuff and you guys sit there

854
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,590
how are the users clicking on stuff how

855
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,169
is it getting there what's the reaction

856
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:50,580
afterwards you got to start to go ahead

857
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:54,690
and figure it out now there are

858
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:57,449
generally 10 phases a fishing kill chain

859
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:59,640
nine of those phases are completely

860
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:01,770
within your control in other words where

861
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:04,710
you are going to fail so let's step

862
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:06,240
through as an example so and here before

863
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:08,820
I start doing this here's what I want to

864
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,679
say if you can detect with a lot of

865
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:13,620
these human based attacks if you can

866
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:16,350
detect them in progress and you stop it

867
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:18,809
against one person you can almost safely

868
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:21,059
assume that if like a fact the criminals

869
00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:23,280
targeting one person they're likely

870
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:26,158
targeting a dozen people or your whole

871
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:29,340
organization simultaneously but if one

872
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:32,340
person says hey I found a USB Drive

873
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:34,590
sitting in the parking lot at least the

874
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:37,709
admins can stop and say wait a second

875
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:38,620
this person found a USB Drive we've been

876
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:40,809
extend out

877
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:42,760
and let everybody know that somebody

878
00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:45,190
dropped USB drives and we're going to

879
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:47,200
tell everybody hey because those other

880
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:49,059
people might not be aware and you send

881
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,520
down a warning and say hey if you found

882
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:53,440
the USB drive in the parking lot please

883
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:55,690
bring them to us immediately and by the

884
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,700
way if you plug them into your system we

885
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:59,049
need to know that as well you know

886
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,880
because you know sometimes it's not

887
00:33:59,049 --> 00:34:03,039
obvious that the smart criminals they're

888
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,380
a smart criminal is not going to say hey

889
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,429
you just plugged in a malicious USB

890
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,260
Drive they're going to make it a

891
00:34:06,429 --> 00:34:10,480
surreptitious what the damages and

892
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:12,520
things like that so anyway that's part

893
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,290
of the issue so anyway think about if

894
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:17,050
you detect if somebody detects it later

895
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:18,550
you can go back and start killing it

896
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:21,310
earlier in the kill chain for other

897
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:23,320
users who did not click on it yet so

898
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:24,580
anyway here's the my obligatory pictures

899
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:28,179
because I didn't have enough picture

900
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:30,460
cycle pictures in it anyway so first

901
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:33,940
place that you can start for a fishing

902
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:35,918
kill chain by the male's of before the

903
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:38,560
mail service in other words the Internet

904
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:40,658
as a whole is the first phase of a

905
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,219
phishing attack because the phishing

906
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:44,349
messages has to have to come from

907
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:46,989
somewhere the phishing messages for

908
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:49,359
example have to come from a botnet at

909
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:51,580
some point in time so somewhere around

910
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:54,609
the internet somebody has compromised

911
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:56,649
these systems now technically you really

912
00:34:54,609 --> 00:34:58,509
can't do much about someone who's

913
00:34:56,649 --> 00:35:00,009
compromised systems around the internet

914
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:02,290
you might turn something like the

915
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:04,109
anti-phishing working group and if I

916
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:06,369
figure out which nodes to blacklist

917
00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:09,160
potentially you might work with your

918
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:10,660
ISPs to tell the ISPs if you know there

919
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,598
are malicious nodes out there please

920
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:15,399
block it for me and so on some companies

921
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,160
have blocked tor links and things like

922
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,500
that so anyway first phase of the kill

923
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:23,170
chain is the internet itself for lack of

924
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:25,150
a better phrase the second phase of the

925
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:25,840
kill chain are your mail servers in

926
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:28,720
other words the

927
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,920
corporate mainframe mail servers a lot

928
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,750
of companies right now that's like

929
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,760
Google meant you know Google Apps and

930
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:36,310
stuff but for the most part your mail

931
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,870
servers are the first phase of phishing

932
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,860
kill chain that are completely within

933
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:41,259
your control

934
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:44,170
add that phase what you should already

935
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:45,460
have or you should have malware filters

936
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:47,920
on the mail servers

937
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:49,630
you should have spam filters on the mail

938
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,480
servers you should pretty much filter

939
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:54,610
out any potential app sometimes and just

940
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,890
say hey a lot of companies do filter out

941
00:35:54,610 --> 00:36:00,340
the app and apps and it's in first I

942
00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:02,080
filter out not apps attachments like and

943
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:04,030
things like that and how where and they

944
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:06,130
run them in a sandbox before they send

945
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:08,170
them to a user so the user is not

946
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:10,330
getting hit with these things but that

947
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:12,310
could all be done on the mail server but

948
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:14,890
let's say for some reason that the mail

949
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:16,540
server has not filtered out the payload

950
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:19,000
it is not accurately filtered out

951
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:20,770
phishing messages or so on the next

952
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,960
place it goes to are the client mail

953
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:25,210
applications in other words might be

954
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,820
your outlook servers it might be your

955
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:29,680
personal inboxes on Google Apps or

956
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:32,500
whatever and if you're looking at

957
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,480
something like outlook outlook has its

958
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:37,150
own anti-spam they look well its own

959
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,400
spam filters it has its own anti-malware

960
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:41,740
like again it has on like Windows

961
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:44,590
Defender for example you might have also

962
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:46,839
purchased some other system like you

963
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:49,420
might be running McAfee or Symantec on

964
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:52,270
your system and those likewise create a

965
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:54,910
no spam filters and now they're filters

966
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:57,030
and so on so your empty is so you're

967
00:36:54,910 --> 00:37:00,129
fishing starting your email client

968
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:03,010
should be filtering out lots of attacks

969
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:05,680
before it's presented to the user but

970
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:08,530
anyway let's just say that doesn't

971
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,870
happen now you have a user sitting there

972
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:13,780
and the user sitting there and saying

973
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:16,150
hey is this message a phishing message

974
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:18,640
or is this not a phishing message and

975
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:21,520
sometimes a user looks in their spam

976
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:23,080
filters and opens up messages and their

977
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,380
spam filters how many people heard about

978
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:28,799
the RSA cap where China happened to our

979
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:31,240
estate to steal to secure ID software

980
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,430
okay they did that because what they

981
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:35,859
wanted to do was China wanted access to

982
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:37,930
defense contractors like Lockheed Martin

983
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:41,110
and so on and they knew that Lockheed

984
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:43,660
Martin was using RSA SecurID tokens and

985
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:45,760
in order to try to compromise it they

986
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:46,540
needed the source code for the RSA

987
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,150
SecurID

988
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:51,130
and so what they did was they wanted to

989
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:53,290
steal the secure ID so what China did

990
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:57,310
was they went ahead and they figured out

991
00:37:53,290 --> 00:38:00,430
that RSA uses monster.com as a

992
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:03,850
recruitment tool and they figured out

993
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:06,190
okay who is the person inside RSA that

994
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:08,980
receives spreadsheets from monster.com

995
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:12,400
with potential applicants for jobs and

996
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:14,410
they sent that person an attachment that

997
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,050
looked like it was from monster.com and

998
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:17,740
it was an outdated spray it was like the

999
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:19,360
windows

1000
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:21,399
they were running an old version of

1001
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,950
Windows excel at that hitting had a

1002
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:26,380
macro on and the email ended senses

1003
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:29,290
targeted message to that person that

1004
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:31,930
actually went to that person spam filter

1005
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:33,820
and that person still pulled that out of

1006
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:36,460
their spam filter to open it up which

1007
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:39,040
then gave China access so anyway that's

1008
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:41,290
something but either way the user has

1009
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,300
the ability to say hey maybe I want to

1010
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:46,120
open this maybe I don't want to open it

1011
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:48,160
in my spam filter in my inbox then the

1012
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:50,410
mail application should say hey wait a

1013
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:53,290
second that would be a really stupid

1014
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:55,540
thing to do are you sure you want to

1015
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:58,210
open up this message out of your spam

1016
00:38:55,540 --> 00:39:00,340
filter and there are applications that

1017
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,780
literally do this you know this isn't

1018
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,310
from the address you're saying that's

1019
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:05,650
from and so on that's why it's in the

1020
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:08,230
spam filter but somebody's going to say

1021
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:11,530
you know what okay the system has warned

1022
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:14,860
me but I still want to open up that

1023
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:18,280
message why because I just do because

1024
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:20,170
that's what users do so anyway they open

1025
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,390
up and they can either delete it they

1026
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:24,340
can report it or they can go ahead and

1027
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:26,710
open it if they don't delete it or

1028
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:28,450
report it and they open it then the next

1029
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:30,940
thing that should happen is the client

1030
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:33,580
prevents the attack the client should

1031
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:36,310
say you know what this message one this

1032
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:38,560
email wants to download a file I'm not

1033
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:40,210
going to let it download or this message

1034
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,880
wants to take you and they want you to

1035
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:44,710
give up credentials and an outside link

1036
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,140
I'm not letting you go to that link and

1037
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:49,270
that technology already exists so anyway

1038
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:51,670
that's what theoretically should happen

1039
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:53,650
data leak prevention should prevent a

1040
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:57,220
lot of you from sending out data and

1041
00:39:53,650 --> 00:40:00,100
stuff so on but anyway let's say the per

1042
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:01,839
you don't have that in place the next

1043
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:03,850
places the network should prevent the

1044
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:06,850
attack in other words you should have

1045
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:08,980
for example web content filters the web

1046
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:10,960
content filters might for example say

1047
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:12,700
hey you know what you want to go to this

1048
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,380
malicious link I'm not letting you out

1049
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:16,000
to that malicious link and they block

1050
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:18,460
the user from going to the malicious

1051
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,290
link or they want to bring the data file

1052
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,850
in and it might say hey you're not

1053
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:24,250
allowed to bring data files in or

1054
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:26,980
whatever the case is so the web filters

1055
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:28,790
the everything should stop that you know

1056
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:32,090
because you have proper attack

1057
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:34,130
proper security measures in place anyway

1058
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:36,350
let's say that doesn't work let's say

1059
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:39,050
the user gives up their credentials to a

1060
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:41,150
third party and then the person tries to

1061
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:43,670
come in and log on is that at some point

1062
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:48,500
in time the network should say hey why

1063
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:51,260
are you logging in from Kazakhstan when

1064
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:53,750
you're simultaneously logged in in your

1065
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:57,140
office or why are you trying to come in

1066
00:40:53,750 --> 00:41:00,350
at 3:00 a.m. as opposed to during normal

1067
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:02,270
work hours or something like that this

1068
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:04,310
should happen or let's say it's a

1069
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:05,840
malware incident like I want to cry or

1070
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:08,509
something like that it should be like

1071
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:10,670
hey why are you individual system trying

1072
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:12,200
to send out messages and infect the rest

1073
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:13,940
of network we're going to stop you and

1074
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:17,089
we're going to isolate you or something

1075
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:18,800
but let's say that doesn't happen at

1076
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:21,410
that point the network should detect

1077
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,930
compromised like you have online them so

1078
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:25,819
a user and user of behavioral analytic

1079
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:28,190
user density and behavioral analytic

1080
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:30,590
types of tools that Detective malicious

1081
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:32,180
systems are malicious and acting against

1082
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:34,730
the systems of the network and they

1083
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:37,399
should we stop detected and mitigated

1084
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:39,680
and pretty much those are the ten phases

1085
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,720
of a phishing kill chain when you stop

1086
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:44,600
and think there are so many different

1087
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:48,589
phases but reality only two of those

1088
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:50,569
phases involve a user doing anything but

1089
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:51,650
everybody says oh I used to click on the

1090
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:54,530
phishing message and we're in the

1091
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:56,690
network that's the good user again it's

1092
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:58,990
the stupid security people behind that

1093
00:41:56,690 --> 00:42:02,150
user that allowed that to occur

1094
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:04,669
so you've got to stop and think in this

1095
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:07,880
whole kill chain of getting the attack

1096
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:10,040
to the user the user acting and then

1097
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:12,500
stopping it because you know the user is

1098
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:15,700
going to click on a link I don't care

1099
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:17,140
how smart the user is you just have it

1100
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:19,598
specifically from the Verizon data

1101
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:22,089
breach report four percent of people

1102
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,770
will click on an attack whether it's a

1103
00:42:22,089 --> 00:42:26,560
phishing message or something else

1104
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:29,380
you've got to expect that if your

1105
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:31,570
percent act even if it's point four

1106
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:34,960
percent and an organization of a

1107
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:37,000
thousand people 0.4 percent is still 40

1108
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,190
people you have 40 people and we start

1109
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,690
noting that but that's still a lot of

1110
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:42,130
people so you've got to start

1111
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:45,190
considering that that's like the kill

1112
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:48,700
chain now backward mitigation like I

1113
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:50,560
mentioned before if the user sees for

1114
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:52,509
example here's a phishing message and

1115
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,820
clicks on the report button and says hey

1116
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:56,859
I see this is a phishing message I'm

1117
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:58,720
going to report it the admins can then

1118
00:42:56,859 --> 00:43:00,910
say hey wait a sec this is a phishing

1119
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,220
message let me try to delete the set of

1120
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:05,140
everybody zip boxes before they open it

1121
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:07,689
up and let me actually send a warning

1122
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:10,598
out to people that says hey if you got a

1123
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:12,790
message from somebody this is not a real

1124
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:14,859
message please delete it if you opened

1125
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:16,839
it up and acted on please let us know so

1126
00:43:14,859 --> 00:43:19,328
that we can prevent it and you're not

1127
00:43:16,839 --> 00:43:21,578
going to be punished for it we just need

1128
00:43:19,329 --> 00:43:23,530
to know so yes we know this attack is

1129
00:43:21,579 --> 00:43:25,630
ongoing please let us know if you're

1130
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:27,990
experiencing this attacker don't open up

1131
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:30,369
the attack in progress that could happen

1132
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:31,660
right let me give a case say how many

1133
00:43:30,369 --> 00:43:34,900
people heard about me in the Syrian

1134
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:37,118
electronic army I think they really hate

1135
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:39,460
me I'm kind of proud of that

1136
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:41,770
the FBI actually said that they hated me

1137
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:45,520
more than President Obama at the time I

1138
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:47,920
asked them to put that in a letter so

1139
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:51,400
anyway let me tell okay so here's what

1140
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,079
happened I went ahead and like so

1141
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,329
companies called me and because of what

1142
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:57,010
I do like you know what happens is when

1143
00:43:55,329 --> 00:43:59,440
you have an attack like a phishing

1144
00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:01,569
attack or something a company you

1145
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,670
company like you know the mandaeans of

1146
00:44:01,569 --> 00:44:05,500
the world or crown strikes or whatever

1147
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:07,930
your coming you give them millions of

1148
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:10,630
dollars they take care of the technical

1149
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:12,759
infection and tell you where you went

1150
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:14,980
wrong in something like that and then

1151
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,690
they go away and then the attackers come

1152
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:18,910
back the next week they get it and do

1153
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:20,380
the same things again why do they get

1154
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:22,420
them do the same things again because

1155
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:24,640
even though you clean the technology you

1156
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:26,800
then stop how the attackers got in a

1157
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:29,618
first place and usually they got in

1158
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,450
because users did something unwise and

1159
00:44:29,619 --> 00:44:34,450
you let the users to do something unwise

1160
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:37,930
so I get called in after the fact to say

1161
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:39,939
hey can you please help us stop this

1162
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:41,919
from keep happening to us so anyway I

1163
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:44,200
would go in the Syrian electronic army

1164
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,550
they were actually really pervasive and

1165
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,810
they're still kind of pervasive but they

1166
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:49,420
don't care about them as much anymore

1167
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:51,190
because they do less public things but

1168
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,930
generally I mean they hack the Wall

1169
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:54,940
Street Journal they hacked a whole bunch

1170
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:57,009
of other people they have The Associated

1171
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:59,829
Press Twitter feed and cause the stock

1172
00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:01,930
market to sink by 500 points in 30

1173
00:44:59,829 --> 00:45:04,359
minutes because they tweeted out from a

1174
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:05,799
Twitter feed they tweeted out that there

1175
00:45:04,359 --> 00:45:07,720
was an attack on the White House of

1176
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,760
President Obama at the time might have

1177
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:11,200
been injured or something like that so

1178
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,690
everybody thought that was really bad in

1179
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:16,569
the stock market to could die so anyway

1180
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:18,550
I got called in and we would you know

1181
00:45:16,569 --> 00:45:21,069
investigate it and stop them and like

1182
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:25,329
patch things up and then what happened

1183
00:45:21,069 --> 00:45:28,300
was an RSA when you was in 2014 there's

1184
00:45:25,329 --> 00:45:30,670
you know 2014 I gave a presentation on

1185
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:32,680
the Serbian electronic army I named a

1186
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:34,240
couple of them and I call them a bunch

1187
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:36,129
of cockroaches I call them the

1188
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:39,339
cockroaches of the internet which they

1189
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:40,810
are and so what happened was you know

1190
00:45:39,339 --> 00:45:42,549
because they just be trying you know

1191
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:45,578
it's they're just annoying they're not

1192
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:46,690
smart they just keep trying so anyway

1193
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:48,040
what happened was

1194
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:52,030
I went ahead and the Syrian electronic

1195
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:54,339
army went apparently RSA recorded the

1196
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:56,920
session and then they finally put it up

1197
00:45:54,339 --> 00:45:59,650
about three months later and then I'm

1198
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:01,420
sitting at home on a Friday evening and

1199
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:04,359
all of us I get it like a tweet like a

1200
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:06,700
directed tweeting IRA a clerk click go

1201
00:46:04,359 --> 00:46:08,380
to this link oh my god go into the link

1202
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:10,750
you know what do they think I'm stupid

1203
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:12,190
so anyway then I get a friend call me up

1204
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:13,720
there like IRA did you go to the artists

1205
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:16,990
they won't pay you no conference page

1206
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:19,149
I'm like no they'll go there so I went

1207
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:22,118
there and I'm like what it looks normal

1208
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:24,069
they're like are you running JavaScript

1209
00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:26,740
I'm like of course not they're like turn

1210
00:46:24,069 --> 00:46:28,420
on JavaScript so I'm not turning on

1211
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:30,490
JavaScript so anyway I turn on

1212
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:32,950
JavaScript and then it's like I went

1213
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:35,140
through your cockaroach I'm like what do

1214
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:36,970
I care what they think of me so anyway

1215
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:38,109
then what happened was I thought you

1216
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:41,980
know I call up a meet

1217
00:46:38,109 --> 00:46:43,750
who is CEO of RSA at the time well your

1218
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:45,880
website's calling me a cockroach what

1219
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:47,230
the hell and he's like anyway so then

1220
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:49,210
he's like we're looking into it so I

1221
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:51,430
started looking into the whole thing and

1222
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:54,460
then what happened was it turned out

1223
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:55,899
that what the Syrian electronic army did

1224
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:58,750
was they looked at the RSA Conference

1225
00:46:55,900 --> 00:47:00,700
homepage and they figured out that when

1226
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:03,130
you go to the RSA Conference homepage

1227
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:05,500
the first thing it does is it loads up a

1228
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:07,510
JavaScript program called lucky orange

1229
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:10,000
and what this lucky arts program does is

1230
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:12,880
track your cursor movement across the

1231
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,410
screen that rs8 uses for analytics so

1232
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,900
yes the RSA conference website is

1233
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:19,420
tracking you by the way so anyway that

1234
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:21,819
aside and what they figured out was that

1235
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,640
this artist the link to started up came

1236
00:47:21,819 --> 00:47:25,680
from

1237
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:28,140
w15 stat suriname slash JavaScript

1238
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:31,169
program so what they did was they

1239
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:34,529
figured out life that server calm that

1240
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:37,710
this company code arrow was the actual

1241
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:39,870
DNS holder for it but so what what

1242
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:42,780
happened was they figured out that the

1243
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:45,569
domain was locked but not this W 1 dot

1244
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:47,940
live stats are calm so the W 1 sub

1245
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:49,890
domain was not locked so then what they

1246
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:52,860
did was they send spear phishing

1247
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:54,900
messages to this code arrow company say

1248
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:57,420
oh it looked like it's from the CEO

1249
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:59,250
saying oh our company was featured in

1250
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:01,110
the Wall Street Journal and they sent

1251
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:03,510
out these spear phishing messages to

1252
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:05,310
people from LinkedIn to the company and

1253
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:07,830
then a couple of their account

1254
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:09,870
executives opened it up and gave their

1255
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:11,220
credentials like it all before you read

1256
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:13,799
the art when you have to enter your user

1257
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:15,870
ID and password which they did and then

1258
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:18,060
the Syrian electronic army people logged

1259
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:19,890
in as those people and then they used

1260
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:24,240
one of their accesses to reach that

1261
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:27,000
reset the W 1 dot live Stetzer accom to

1262
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:29,279
an injured on comm file so literally

1263
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,560
they in happy RS a website itself

1264
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,260
they just redirected the domain that it

1265
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:35,910
called when it started up and which just

1266
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:38,280
sent people to a picture so anyway I

1267
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:40,200
wrote an article on my website on why

1268
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:43,200
the Syrian electronic army was still a

1269
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:47,549
bunch of laying cockroaches so then what

1270
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:49,620
happened was a day later they ended up

1271
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:51,240
hacking the Wall Street Journal Twitter

1272
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:53,490
feeds and the Wall Street Journal

1273
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:55,109
Twitter feed yeah well that's the

1274
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:57,180
BuzzFeed so anyway they have to Wall

1275
00:48:55,110 --> 00:49:00,260
Street Journal Twitter feed declaring me

1276
00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:03,569
the cockroach of the Internet I was like

1277
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:05,700
really so anyway the thing that bothered

1278
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:07,970
me most was a report from The Wall

1279
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:11,549
Street Journal retweeted it out

1280
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:13,319
you idiot so anyway then what happened

1281
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:16,380
was I called up the Wall Street Journal

1282
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:17,940
which is run like CBS and and I started

1283
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:19,920
getting like you know information from

1284
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:22,530
there and then what happened was when

1285
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:25,290
the Wall Street Journal was hacked as I

1286
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:27,210
went CNO and was hacked The Wall Street

1287
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:29,070
Journal covered it and now that the Wall

1288
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:31,230
Street Journal was hak-seon and wanted

1289
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:32,670
to cover it so CNN interviewed me and

1290
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:34,950
again I called them a bunch of

1291
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:36,600
cockroaches but I was also called the

1292
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:38,339
go-to guy for the Internet and people

1293
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,900
are coming to me say Kyra are you the

1294
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:41,910
Syrian electronic army if you're getting

1295
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:44,010
a lot of publicity out of it I don't

1296
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:46,529
know I couldn't the plan this any better

1297
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:49,110
honestly and what happened was then like

1298
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:51,570
so CNN ran a story and then two days

1299
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:54,330
later the Syrian electronic army hacked

1300
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:58,050
the BuzzFeed Twitter feeds so call me a

1301
00:49:54,330 --> 00:50:00,210
cockroach and I was kind of like this is

1302
00:49:58,050 --> 00:50:02,190
really getting old and then apparently

1303
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:04,320
the Syrian intelligence services which

1304
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:06,840
would give them money said what do you

1305
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:09,510
wasting all this time for on this thing

1306
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:11,400
and then like this so like two hours

1307
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:13,860
later they hacked up Oh must be by the

1308
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:16,380
way stop talking about Syria and I'm

1309
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:18,270
like that's what they think so then what

1310
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:20,250
happened was I called Brian Krebs I'm

1311
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:22,230
like I know Brian and then I'm like

1312
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:24,240
Brian's like they're doing all this just

1313
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:26,370
to call you names I'm like yeah it's

1314
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:29,100
like that's even too late for me to

1315
00:50:26,370 --> 00:50:31,799
cover at this point so then I started I

1316
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:33,600
wrote another article I was going to

1317
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,640
publish in computer world pretty much

1318
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,740
covering the whole

1319
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,839
because there's a whole bunch of stuff

1320
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:40,399
which is really not technical that they

1321
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:43,700
were doing and still having tremendous

1322
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,500
success so I was like right oh you know

1323
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:47,839
so I wrote an article for computer world

1324
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:49,309
you know don't like we're talking it's

1325
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:51,230
like you know what they're gonna try to

1326
00:50:49,309 --> 00:50:51,680
have computer world really really

1327
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:53,960
quickly

1328
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,460
so before we went ahead and wrote

1329
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:57,950
summers it released the article on

1330
00:50:55,460 --> 00:51:00,589
computer world what we did was we gave

1331
00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:02,538
people in computer world and many

1332
00:51:00,589 --> 00:51:04,849
awareness lesson very specifically

1333
00:51:02,539 --> 00:51:07,039
targeting how this was going to happen I

1334
00:51:04,849 --> 00:51:08,900
go for the most part we can pretty much

1335
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:11,150
assume that they will send a message

1336
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:13,880
that looks like it's from an executive

1337
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:16,369
of computer world of The IDG the parent

1338
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:18,769
company of computer world and they will

1339
00:51:16,369 --> 00:51:21,470
send you to a link to their like of a

1340
00:51:18,769 --> 00:51:23,689
magazine or something about the thing

1341
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:25,549
and then they will go ahead and ask you

1342
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:28,010
for your credentials do not give this

1343
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:29,569
once you get it report the message and

1344
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:31,940
send it to the admins and then

1345
00:51:29,569 --> 00:51:34,000
simultaneously delete it and so on so

1346
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:36,529
anyway we did that the article went line

1347
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,240
within four hours of the article going

1348
00:51:36,529 --> 00:51:40,759
live they started receiving these

1349
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:43,368
phishing messages and the funny part was

1350
00:51:40,759 --> 00:51:45,470
they knew these guys are so lame so I'm

1351
00:51:43,369 --> 00:51:48,019
trying not to curse but these guys are

1352
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:50,209
so lame what happened was they sent out

1353
00:51:48,019 --> 00:51:51,950
a message from an executive who left the

1354
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:54,079
company two months earlier and just

1355
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:56,689
never changed his LinkedIn profile so

1356
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:58,670
everybody knew from the start how that

1357
00:51:56,690 --> 00:52:00,140
was going to be a fake message but then

1358
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:02,029
they started saying it's like and then

1359
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:02,690
people would like a few people did click

1360
00:52:02,029 --> 00:52:06,050
and answer

1361
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:10,700
credentials like you know Assad at you

1362
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:12,099
know a whole calm like passwords bite me

1363
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:14,868
and stuff like that

1364
00:52:12,099 --> 00:52:17,089
but anyway they literally got had no

1365
00:52:14,869 --> 00:52:19,760
success doing it and why was that

1366
00:52:17,089 --> 00:52:21,560
because anything exactly how the attacks

1367
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,790
were going to come we do exactly what

1368
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:25,400
they would look like so we can prevent

1369
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:26,960
people proactively we knew exactly what

1370
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,490
would happen we knew what would happen

1371
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,440
if somebody perceived the messenger

1372
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:31,910
clicked on it and then we have people

1373
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:34,220
trained on what to do and how to

1374
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:36,200
properly respond so that's using the

1375
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:37,939
Killa train but the critical thing is

1376
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:41,569
the missing piece for a lot of this is

1377
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:43,670
process nobody has established for a lot

1378
00:52:41,569 --> 00:52:46,190
of these things a coordinated process

1379
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:49,069
for overseeing a combination of

1380
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:51,859
Technology governance and awareness and

1381
00:52:49,069 --> 00:52:53,359
combining that as a whole and that's the

1382
00:52:51,859 --> 00:52:56,359
biggest problem when we're talking about

1383
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:57,799
human based attacks as a whole so I want

1384
00:52:56,359 --> 00:52:59,480
to start doing this nobody's been

1385
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:01,490
finding the process to the user and

1386
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:04,369
letting the users know what that process

1387
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:06,828
is so this is the concept of try again

1388
00:53:04,369 --> 00:53:09,640
and with a human security officer we

1389
00:53:06,829 --> 00:53:12,369
don't have anybody out there who is

1390
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:16,009
specifically looking at a coordinated

1391
00:53:12,369 --> 00:53:19,700
response to user ever despite the fact

1392
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:22,790
that user error in one way or another is

1393
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:24,589
causing 90% of the major incidents that

1394
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:26,839
are out there and that's not even making

1395
00:53:24,589 --> 00:53:29,029
it up this is every study out there is

1396
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:31,369
showing that the human is the primary

1397
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:33,950
attack vector and significant attacks

1398
00:53:31,369 --> 00:53:36,319
and nobody is out there saying it's they

1399
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:39,049
have little piecemeal effort so we have

1400
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:39,950
this well put in some technology to stop

1401
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:41,420
if she knows

1402
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:43,430
sample you know we'll have somebody

1403
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:45,230
sending out funny videos and again we'll

1404
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:47,598
put up policies and procedures on the

1405
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:50,390
shelf nobody actually defines what a

1406
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:52,609
person's job is nobody actually defines

1407
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:55,069
what an email you know how to review

1408
00:53:52,609 --> 00:53:57,259
emails as an example they just say Oh

1409
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:59,329
watch this video does the video have

1410
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:01,700
anything to do with your own internal

1411
00:53:59,329 --> 00:54:03,829
governance usually not I mean because

1412
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:06,140
think about it this way you are letting

1413
00:54:03,829 --> 00:54:10,190
you are letting like this third-party

1414
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:12,529
video trying to set your security

1415
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:15,410
policies for how your users are to react

1416
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:18,560
so for example if you have a video that

1417
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:20,569
says oh a good password it has eight

1418
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:22,549
characters have numbers letters and

1419
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:25,070
special characters and that's how you

1420
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:27,530
should design your password that's the

1421
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:29,780
standard off-the-shelf video how many of

1422
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:31,790
you actually have that policy we worked

1423
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:33,619
with the company together putting

1424
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:36,320
together their awareness materials and

1425
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:37,490
they had a 10 character password more

1426
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,109
like we can't let you use any

1427
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:40,459
off-the-shelf videos because nobody has

1428
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:42,529
an off-the-shelf video with a 10

1429
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:44,750
character password so we had to put

1430
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:46,640
special videos together and so on the

1431
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:48,109
specific targeted guidance and

1432
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:50,810
everything so anyway

1433
00:54:48,109 --> 00:54:52,940
somebody has to look at if we know the

1434
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:55,339
user is going to be the target of an

1435
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:57,710
attack what are the likely attacks and

1436
00:54:55,339 --> 00:55:00,500
go through the kill chain to figure out

1437
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:02,810
it every face how can I prevent the

1438
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:04,790
attack from getting to the user how do I

1439
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:07,220
get the user to do the right thing and

1440
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:09,349
then it simultaneously how I litigate

1441
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:11,810
the damage and again from yesterday also

1442
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:14,030
how do you mitigate the damage if the

1443
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:15,710
user is just being malicious because

1444
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:17,180
then the user you don't have to worry

1445
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:19,280
about how the attack back to him you

1446
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:21,710
have to worry about what processes and

1447
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,500
abilities did you hit the user and then

1448
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:23,940
having

1449
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:26,520
Tech when the user starts to do

1450
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:28,980
something wrong accounting does that

1451
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:30,390
really really well but we don't learn

1452
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:32,160
from other disciplines because we're

1453
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:34,350
just smarter than all those people right

1454
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:36,569
so anyway that's part of the whole thing

1455
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:38,520
so what is the human security officer do

1456
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:40,620
and I pretty much spoke too much most of

1457
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:42,810
the slide you know it's a coordinated

1458
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:45,390
response after you look at a kill chain

1459
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:47,250
what you know and you should store up

1460
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:49,799
first what is the governance that needs

1461
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:52,740
to be put in place but the user is for

1462
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:54,450
example is supposed to take data and PII

1463
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:57,810
and distribute that PII

1464
00:55:54,450 --> 00:56:00,629
what is the process for that from step

1465
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:03,570
by step by step then you figure out how

1466
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:05,640
does technology fit into that can you

1467
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:08,310
use technology to take away potential

1468
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:10,920
damage the user can do as an example

1469
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:13,290
then what technology can stop the damage

1470
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:14,820
from occurring after that those are all

1471
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:16,610
critical concerns and then you have

1472
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:18,660
awareness and this is the big thing

1473
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:21,390
awareness like I said guess there should

1474
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:24,690
not be how to scare people away from the

1475
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:27,120
Wesley lab awareness should be how do

1476
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:29,460
you get people to do the right things

1477
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:31,140
what are the right things to many

1478
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:34,200
awareness programs are featured on

1479
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:37,290
scaring people about you know the be get

1480
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:39,750
the bad evil hacker as opposed to saying

1481
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:41,640
here's the proper way to do your job and

1482
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:44,190
if you do your job in the right way

1483
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:45,960
you won't cause damage or you will do it

1484
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:48,860
in a way that will not result in

1485
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:52,130
forwarding the hacker attack and so on

1486
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:54,570
family so w-2 fraud I gave this example

1487
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:59,340
yesterday so let me talk with instead

1488
00:56:54,570 --> 00:57:01,200
about so let's yeah give w to throw it

1489
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:04,800
again just because I'm getting tired so

1490
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:07,520
a w-2 fraud like I mentioned somebody

1491
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:10,370
like around tax season somebody

1492
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:13,130
w-2 fraud message and they're gonna send

1493
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:14,990
it to somebody in HR and the w2 message

1494
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:17,180
and the message is going to say I'm the

1495
00:57:14,990 --> 00:57:19,189
CEO I'm traveling we just have a new

1496
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:22,069
accounting firm the accounting firm has

1497
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:24,290
to send out w-2s to our employees please

1498
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:26,210
send out this information it's gotta go

1499
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:29,120
out today I'm in a hurry whatever the

1500
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:30,980
case may be so anyway they send out and

1501
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:32,900
then the the user is sitting there like

1502
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:35,000
oh this is from the CEO I gotta do it

1503
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:37,160
what the user should actually do and

1504
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,630
some I should human security officer

1505
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:40,850
some I should go through the process of

1506
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:42,260
saying hey the user looks at the message

1507
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:44,960
in the first place the message should be

1508
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:46,760
filtered out or if it's not those it out

1509
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,290
should say this comes from an external

1510
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:50,990
source so clearly it's not coming from

1511
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:52,700
the CEO and if it cut even if it comes

1512
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:57,919
from the CEO the user should say the

1513
00:57:52,700 --> 00:58:01,100
process w2w tubes contain Pio my process

1514
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:03,560
for PII is I don't send out PII I give

1515
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:04,700
any requests for PII to my manager who

1516
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:07,340
gives it to the head of Human Resources

1517
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:09,620
and then if it's to go out they need the

1518
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:11,930
support of the general counsel so that

1519
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:13,910
message should be shot up to the top and

1520
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:15,830
the user says hey I don't care if it's

1521
00:58:13,910 --> 00:58:18,649
the CEO sending this I'm not allowed to

1522
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:20,569
do this and then even if that fails and

1523
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:21,020
the user finds the information and sends

1524
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:22,430
it out

1525
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:24,980
you should have David Lee prevention

1526
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:27,620
software on your endpoints filtering out

1527
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:30,680
any sort of w-2 related information any

1528
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:32,299
sort of PII going to external sources so

1529
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:34,250
that should theoretically take care of

1530
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:35,570
it so again at the end of the day which

1531
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:37,580
ones are you creating with your

1532
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:39,350
awareness programs how are you doing

1533
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:41,290
with stuff and I use the example of

1534
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:44,029
Marines because I was in the Marine and

1535
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:45,670
there's a whole thing of anybody think I

1536
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:47,579
asked this last year day

1537
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:50,950
in general anybody here in the military

1538
00:58:47,579 --> 00:58:53,049
at one point in time or another okay you

1539
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:55,000
people know a general orders of the

1540
00:58:53,049 --> 00:58:57,220
century and you might hear that every

1541
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,920
organization has general orders of the

1542
00:58:57,220 --> 00:59:01,538
century why because they expect the

1543
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,400
centuries in other words people

1544
00:59:01,539 --> 00:59:05,559
everybody does our duties usually it's

1545
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:09,279
low-level nobodies do guarding these and

1546
00:59:05,559 --> 00:59:12,190
what happens is they expect absolutely

1547
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:14,349
no brains whatsoever from these people

1548
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:16,240
and what they do in that case is they

1549
00:59:14,349 --> 00:59:18,400
have general orders of the century and

1550
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:20,950
general order one for example in the

1551
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:23,829
Marines was do not put your post until

1552
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:25,450
properly relieved why do they have to

1553
00:59:23,829 --> 00:59:27,250
give a general order that says don't

1554
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:29,470
leave your post until you're properly

1555
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:31,269
relieved because they think somebody

1556
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:33,549
might just walk up yes

1557
00:59:31,269 --> 00:59:35,589
do they also think and this is actually

1558
00:59:33,549 --> 00:59:38,529
more important do they think that for

1559
00:59:35,589 --> 00:59:41,529
example let's say I am on my post and my

1560
00:59:38,529 --> 00:59:43,750
post next to me is being attacked the

1561
00:59:41,529 --> 00:59:46,059
natural reaction is I should grab my

1562
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:49,029
rifle and go help defend that post right

1563
00:59:46,059 --> 00:59:51,309
so I know they don't want that person to

1564
00:59:49,029 --> 00:59:53,200
actually think hey wait a second I'm

1565
00:59:51,309 --> 00:59:54,880
going to support them because this

1566
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:57,669
person might not realize that that's the

1567
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,890
diversions you can through your post so

1568
00:59:57,670 --> 01:00:02,440
they say general you do not leave in any

1569
00:59:59,890 --> 01:00:03,910
way shape or form and then they also say

1570
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:06,130
you're in command so if the general

1571
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:08,440
drives up and says hey I'm a general I'm

1572
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:10,390
going to go through you're like I'm in

1573
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:12,720
charge here you're not on my list

1574
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:14,220
it's like oh I don't care it's like okay

1575
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:16,140
now I have to go to general or nun

1576
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:18,000
general or nine is Freddy's situation

1577
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:19,710
not covered by instruction call the

1578
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,630
corporal of the guard why is that

1579
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:23,790
important because I'm an idiot

1580
01:00:21,630 --> 01:00:26,849
I don't know any better they want me to

1581
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:28,800
call somebody else for help so I'm going

1582
01:00:26,849 --> 01:00:30,630
to let somebody else make the decision

1583
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:32,910
who has more time with more authority

1584
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:34,980
than me and so that's the thing I'm not

1585
01:00:32,910 --> 01:00:37,589
saying treat your people like idiots but

1586
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:40,319
treat people in the proper way to do

1587
01:00:37,589 --> 01:00:43,140
their job not what to be afraid of that

1588
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:45,660
is this the lastly wabbit at any point

1589
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:47,339
in time you want your people here's what

1590
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:49,560
I'm supposed to do how I'm supposed to

1591
01:00:47,339 --> 01:00:51,509
behave not what am I supposed to be

1592
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:53,099
afraid of because if you can training

1593
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:54,990
them hackers are going to do this it's

1594
01:00:53,099 --> 01:00:56,730
going to be well is that the lastly what

1595
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:58,950
happened or is that somebody it's like

1596
01:00:56,730 --> 01:01:01,020
well no I never nobody ever took they

1597
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:03,839
said that hacker might try to be an

1598
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:05,430
executive wanting w2 information but

1599
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:07,259
this person just wants health care

1600
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:09,509
information so that's okay nobody ever

1601
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:11,190
warned me about that you don't want

1602
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:13,859
people to make that decision you want

1603
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:16,589
people PII here's how it releases as an

1604
01:01:13,859 --> 01:01:19,049
example so anyway in summary acknowledge

1605
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:21,060
user family is not a user failing as in

1606
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:23,160
your family it's your organization's

1607
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:25,140
failing then that's fundamental there

1608
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:26,819
needs to be coordination and mitigating

1609
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:28,980
attack and losses for people in other

1610
01:01:26,819 --> 01:01:31,079
words technology governance and

1611
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:33,720
awareness have to be combined in a way

1612
01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:35,460
that people are organized and new

1613
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:37,348
organizations have things like chief

1614
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:39,390
network architects that oversee make

1615
01:01:37,349 --> 01:01:41,609
sure all technology works together and

1616
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:44,578
stuff like that why isn't there given

1617
01:01:41,609 --> 01:01:47,009
the user is the real you know the vein

1618
01:01:44,579 --> 01:01:49,500
of everybody's existence these days why

1619
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:51,569
is nobody overseeing the user in a

1620
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:54,329
coordinated way because it's so much

1621
01:01:51,569 --> 01:01:56,310
more than awareness anyway this is the

1622
01:01:54,329 --> 01:01:56,760
image I left other people with yesterday

1623
01:01:56,310 --> 01:02:00,029
but

1624
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:02,520
remember your users are just when a user

1625
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:04,860
makes a mistake they're the canary in

1626
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:06,509
the coal mine for your organization that

1627
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:08,730
the user makes a mistake there's a

1628
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:11,520
problem with your entire system and

1629
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:13,590
making that we use a war where is just

1630
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:16,259
like giving the canary in a coalmine a

1631
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:18,960
gas mask you got to go ahead and make

1632
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:20,850
sure that you provide if that user makes

1633
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:23,010
a mistake is not the stupid user it's

1634
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:25,080
where did the problem occur in my system

1635
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:27,870
that allowed that user to be stupid and

1636
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:31,440
for us to get damaged anyway by my book

1637
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:36,140
