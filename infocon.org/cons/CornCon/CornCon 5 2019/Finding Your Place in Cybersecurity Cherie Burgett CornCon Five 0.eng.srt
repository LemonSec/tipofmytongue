hello I'm Cheri forget I am the director

00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:58,000
of operations for those lightening

candles' ice pack if you don't know that

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,590
an ice pack is it's an information

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,380
sharing and analysis Center is most

10
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:08,709
answered every industry in this country

11
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:12,700
has one in order to protect critical

12
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:16,180
infrastructure and so financial sectors

13
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:19,329
had the longest running 15 years 7,000

14
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:22,360
members and mining and metals as new to

15
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:25,360
the party he's brought up about two

16
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,250
years ago and I was invited here to be

17
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:33,660
able to talk about my journey into cyber

18
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:33,660
security so

19
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:42,820
so this is actually the older version of

20
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:46,510
my slides I couldn't get my slides onto

21
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:49,480
their computer at your time so so let's

22
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:53,019
stop pretending that there is a defined

23
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:55,540
career path into cybersecurity oh I just

24
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,010
went over across the way and picked up a

25
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,280
book and there's some really helpful

26
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:02,290
well-intentioned advice for people to

27
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:06,690
try and get more people interviews to

28
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:09,640
attract more get eight cybersecurity fun

29
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:11,980
but it's not how it works for everybody

30
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,470
I think you might took a poll of how

31
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:18,130
each of you got into cyber security it

32
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:20,220
would not be the same story I'm going to

33
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,570
share a couple of personal stories and

34
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,060
I'm going to talk about how you can

35
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:28,470
customize your education and focus on

36
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:31,930
your interests and your strengths and

37
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:35,680
identify a gap so in cybersecurity

38
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:38,210
everyone has their their frustration of

39
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,340
choice as to what is missing

40
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:42,350
history and I'm going to talk about some

41
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:47,060
of those gaps and how you can be the

42
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:49,489
person to fill those gaps and we're talk

43
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:53,120
about networking finding mentors why

44
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:56,950
mentoring is vital for our industry and

45
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,950
how to make your cybersecurity

46
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:17,700
how it all started I guess six years ago

47
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:23,310
by God on a Greyhound bus I was a stay

48
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:27,510
at home army wife of four kids and I

49
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:29,940
wanted to I was a dealer I love games

50
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:32,039
and one of my friend said why don't you

51
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:35,190
go to DEFCON you'd be you know he'd fit

52
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:38,700
right in and so the only way I could

53
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:39,510
afford to go was a Greyhound buses $200

54
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:45,830
roundtrip

55
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:45,830
I got a space available military-style

56
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,639
the timeshare

57
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:05,340
because the back of the buses were

58
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:09,270
implying the most interesting

59
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:12,299
conversations I got to sit next to a guy

60
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:19,060
who just got a physical for 20 years he

61
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:22,030
was family at home I got to

62
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:25,210
or that their dream was to travel around

63
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:28,479
the world and so part of that truth

64
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:32,710
involved find the economic who needs to

65
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:34,570
go across country and I got too many

66
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:37,719
people and they shared their stories

67
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:42,909
with me and it was an amazing board a

68
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:46,720
bus trip and it landed in the attack on

69
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:48,820
and I ran from the bus stop I grab my

70
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,940
things I dropped enough liquor time and

71
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:54,340
then went to go get my - and after a

72
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:57,520
government that took that money and I'm

73
00:05:54,340 --> 00:06:12,359
like okay I'm here I'm here I'm alone

74
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:12,359
I'm here to have fun and so so so I

75
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,630
yeah who's walking by that said that

76
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:20,450
line is pretty long right now if you

77
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:23,390
pretend that you know me I'll just stand

78
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,590
next to me and he's like what what do

79
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:29,270
you want me to do and what Dad you

80
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:31,250
comply - okay don't bother you and so

81
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,659
he's like okay I'll do that

82
00:06:31,250 --> 00:07:02,270
these two next to me is like so what's

83
00:06:32,660 --> 00:07:04,600
her name and we got to know each other

84
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,599
and

85
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:17,770
I'm Justin and he's just again like here

86
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:21,070
but I thought I would like to be fast

87
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:26,039
forward three years later I'm still

88
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:36,640
going to that time and I still just and

89
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:40,090
why haven't you started yet and he was

90
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:42,820
right I it took me a few years to

91
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:49,289
realize it but I read cyber had a place

92
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:54,750
for me I I didn't see myself like like I

93
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:54,750
felt that I was an outlier outlier is

94
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,569
[Music]

95
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:30,359
so what is my background anyway this was

96
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:32,849
this was room and a newspaper article I

97
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,039
was reading interesting a priest or

98
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:40,080
Minister can help you find that a Cyprus

99
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:41,490
and not very low so that line was

100
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,110
actually written about me my background

101
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:49,410
is theology so how does theology

102
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:52,440
translate to cyber security if you think

103
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:59,399
about it theology is the study of ethics

104
00:08:52,440 --> 00:09:09,690
and human beliefs and the impact that

105
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:13,090
who believed so it hasn't changed in the

106
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:15,250
time that people have

107
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:18,490
that we still have coral these gonna

108
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:23,190
drive our behaviors drive what we feel

109
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:26,320
it at the Cullen unethical and it can

110
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:29,340
people's beliefs to convince do things

111
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:32,410
but you might go wrong right

112
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:35,080
and so if you how about the illusion on

113
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:37,510
your team you can have someone that will

114
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:45,730
analyze information of different way

115
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:47,830
than the rescue team so education so

116
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:51,780
doesn't matter what your educational

117
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:55,390
background is it really doesn't and

118
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:57,760
you'll still need more it doesn't matter

119
00:09:55,390 --> 00:10:03,460
where you're starting where is a journey

120
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:05,110
for all of us and so my my

121
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,640
recommendation if you're just starting

122
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:11,130
out starting on the Network+

123
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:14,410
disappearing plus and use that as your

124
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:16,180
your exploration of the field you'll

125
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:19,270
find as you go through

126
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,270
[Music]

127
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:46,550
those those and wait

128
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,870
[Music]

129
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:13,279
[Music]

130
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:24,080
in disciplinary studies degrees you need

131
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:25,580
to pick you know a few key or two or

132
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,220
three key areas that you want to

133
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:31,730
concentrate in my concentration

134
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:35,630
currently is in psychology and science

135
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:41,089
and cyber intelligence and you can work

136
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:45,820
out a degree plan with an advisory board

137
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:48,770
and customize your own in education

138
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:50,420
after DVM is still trying to figure out

139
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:53,810
what we need as our security

140
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:56,209
professionals that they're still trying

141
00:11:53,810 --> 00:12:00,770
to figure out what program is right to

142
00:11:56,209 --> 00:12:03,739
train us and you once you get in you

143
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:08,540
start realizing that there's so much

144
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:12,310
more involved walls and security

145
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,310
controls you start realizing

146
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:18,589
like they're two users that we're

147
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,590
working the people

148
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:36,650
so I work for a nonprofit organization

149
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:40,280
and we started up fairies we started up

150
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:43,790
with five members and we didn't want to

151
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:46,850
take any government funding to another

152
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:50,480
organization so we strapped it for the

153
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:53,510
first year to half and so in that we did

154
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,310
that we discovered that there were

155
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:57,740
things that we could do that didn't

156
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:59,420
really cost a lot of money we didn't

157
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:02,840
need a ton of money to start up there

158
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:04,939
were there platforms already built by

159
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:09,170
wonderful people there were already

160
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:11,150
sharing organizations and open source

161
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:12,800
intelligence that we tap into their work

162
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:16,819
government programs that we could tap

163
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:19,250
into and so the lessons that we learn

164
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:29,080
word is that you don't have to spend a

165
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:29,080
lot of money to build something so when

166
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:36,500
so the vendor community and I don't like

167
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:38,270
that I don't want to get under too much

168
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,400
of our time because we really do rely on

169
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:44,270
them and our relationship with our

170
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:47,949
vendors is quite important and that's

171
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:47,949
one of the things that I were to do is

172
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:56,000
but a lot of times when I go to these

173
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:57,560
conferences what we've seen is vendors

174
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,260
telling you Keith this is your problem

175
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:05,630
and this is the box that's gonna fix

176
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:08,779
that problem and so what you would

177
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:16,870
actually have to focus on you know the

178
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:21,500
things that matter without the idea

179
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:47,959
because if remember of mine can purchase

180
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:52,450
a service and so human factor security

181
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:55,130
is sort of driving that culture security

182
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:56,779
in your in your company and then

183
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:59,209
answering the questions how do I get

184
00:14:56,779 --> 00:15:01,550
people in my company to actually care

185
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:05,569
how do I get the machine operator to

186
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:08,779
care about cybersecurity I also focus on

187
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:11,590
the adversaries and their motivations

188
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:16,660
and their activities

189
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:19,630
like target search and educate people on

190
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:23,920
how to be less of a target don't stick

191
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:25,900
out I talk about cybersecurity strategy

192
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,209
this is something that a lot of

193
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:31,120
Thunderstone a lot of seasons don't have

194
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:37,029
lost support and this strategy is how do

195
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:42,060
i how do I communicate our industries

196
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:42,060
are our comp our relations polls and

197
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:46,980
communicate our goals and how

198
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,980
cybersecurity

199
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:56,180
because if you're not supporting your

200
00:15:52,370 --> 00:16:00,080
business there is no reason your there's

201
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:02,410
no reason to have you there in an issues

202
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:05,290
report so I work in the

203
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:09,249
industry and we are right now at the

204
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:12,410
explosion of innovative ideas and

205
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:16,429
technology we have the Heartless

206
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:19,910
driverless haul trucks we are looking at

207
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:22,730
underground mining so we remove people

208
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:26,509
from dangerous situations and having it

209
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:55,040
done in a room above ground with Xbox

210
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:58,689
controllers people people never really

211
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:02,540
heard of the - having a major breach

212
00:16:58,689 --> 00:17:04,520
until a few years ago they never prayed

213
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:07,309
and they didn't have to agree but it

214
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,020
because they didn't pull data and people

215
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:12,289
think of cyber security and data

216
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:13,939
security and I think that the box that

217
00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:16,379
we

218
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:20,819
cyber security and data security

219
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:25,020
cybersecurity is security and how we use

220
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:31,379
technology to secure our our complex and

221
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:33,900
lives are our technology and one of the

222
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:36,120
things that was important and I I get to

223
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:40,920
travel all over the world to do this and

224
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:43,110
I support secure right of mine I do

225
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,600
threat modeling with designers and

226
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:47,850
innovators so that they can talk about

227
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,918
cyber security issues early in the

228
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:54,409
process that is coming up with the idea

229
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,410
for innovative strategy

230
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:08,160
so where did you fit your challenges to

231
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:12,240
think about cybersecurity differently we

232
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:14,790
fit cybersecurity into a box and not

233
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,880
every not everyone here does the same

234
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:20,340
did I everyone here was like me and we

235
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,270
need to start looking for more at to

236
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:26,840
adding more diversity to the industry

237
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:30,730
because we need to be sharing ideas

238
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:34,490
and water brother snow terms of how we

239
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:39,279
deal with address these problems do you

240
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:41,809
need to be yourself that's kind of

241
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:44,570
conversation that I just decide is how

242
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:47,928
public didn't want to show the world

243
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:51,049
that they belong and pretend to be tough

244
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:53,379
or pretend to be thoroughly or you know

245
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:56,570
pretend to be someone that they are not

246
00:18:53,379 --> 00:18:58,219
and it's okay to be silly and have fun

247
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:01,070
because there's a lot of us here that

248
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:03,740
Ursula can have fun and you can not

249
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:06,200
really shave your career about your own

250
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:09,019
movie skills the job that you have now

251
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:12,980
won't be the job that you have next year

252
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:16,519
even if a title it changes and you can

253
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:19,309
be you are the greatest influence around

254
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:21,740
what that job looks like next year and

255
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:24,980
so you can slowly change your job over

256
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:28,720
time to or match what's best suited for

257
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:32,360
you and one industry actually is

258
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,639
networking networking people these types

259
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,919
of conferences from the best place for

260
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:39,409
that this is where

261
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:45,050
earn as is where a lot of people find

262
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:48,320
people to to mentor or to events work

263
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:50,870
and to to know where the next child

264
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,450
opiates or get that recommendation or

265
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:56,810
know what next step they should take for

266
00:19:53,450 --> 00:20:00,380
the path that they're on and this is

267
00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:03,080
your industry this really is your

268
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:04,820
industry is something I tell my ice pack

269
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:07,280
all the time this is your eyes back and

270
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:10,129
when I was in a party here I was like

271
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:13,360
this is your FRG leader so this is sort

272
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:19,490
of a recurring fee this is your industry

273
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:22,929
we're the ones who shave that and we're

274
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:22,930
the ones regretted it

275
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,090
thank you

276
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:50,309
education never stops absolutely never

277
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:51,928
stops and that's one thing my husband

278
00:20:50,309 --> 00:21:02,539
passkeys like so after you're done this

279
00:20:51,929 --> 00:21:02,539
you get a job you don't have to be

280
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:30,330
supported as the labor

281
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:33,649
we're security was the steps as far as

282
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:35,820
like we took you guys build Isaac no

283
00:21:33,649 --> 00:21:40,199
your eyes that collaboration with other

284
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:43,529
security when Isaac yeah okay so our car

285
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:46,740
steps that we took for our eyes back it

286
00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:50,330
was actually the idea of the guy who's

287
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,330
sitting in front of e-commerce

288
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:59,940
he tortured that poor guy oh so it was

289
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:02,940
his idea because he really wanted one

290
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:05,220
for the industry and he wasn't the only

291
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,290
one who came up with his idea in fact a

292
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:12,059
few years prior somebody else tried to

293
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:14,610
edit swamped and the thing that he said

294
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:17,010
that that they really needed to keep it

295
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:18,990
together was someone that would be

296
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:21,480
working with everybody at the

297
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:24,630
Independent Party that knew how to get

298
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:27,150
people to work together and that could

299
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:30,270
help analyze and get give them a bigger

300
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:33,270
picture of what was going on and so he

301
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:35,610
started off with five that we had to

302
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,540
that he had to sell the idea to as to

303
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:38,909
why we did it

304
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:42,360
and once they started off with why each

305
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:44,940
one pledge and then they brought me in

306
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,919
and we had our first meeting and we

307
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:49,220
decided okay this is what we want to do

308
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:52,299
this is where we want to go sherry

309
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,299
[Music]

310
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:02,299
and he hates me and said I want to build

311
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:05,059
an ice pack for critical manufacturing

312
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:07,710
and I said well you're in luck because

313
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:09,750
we're mighty can battle with into the

314
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:15,450
metals company you can help us build

315
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:19,830
ours and so so it's it's a collaborative

316
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:22,590
group effort and it basically meant we

317
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:25,379
have awesome people that really have

318
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:27,030
this on fire idea and believe in the ice

319
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:31,640
pack and I'm not going to fail because

320
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:35,158
we don't want to pick everyone bought it

321
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:37,740
any second question all the question was

322
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:40,049
does you collaborate with other of your

323
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:42,570
late-night sites so yes we do

324
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:46,260
collaborate with other security ice

325
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:48,928
packs we belong to a larger organization

326
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:52,350
the international association of

327
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:57,809
certified is so there's some my salads

328
00:23:52,350 --> 00:24:00,389
in there my cell is a the newer form of

329
00:23:57,809 --> 00:24:03,480
the eye side so that every industry can

330
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:07,480
create a group that they see that and so

331
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:09,610
for example and and here's just an idea
