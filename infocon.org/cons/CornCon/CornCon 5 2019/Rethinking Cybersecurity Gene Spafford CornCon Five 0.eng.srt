boy up art you know that's that's right

14
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,100

15
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:02,120
myself so I want to introduce our first

16
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:05,430
keynote speaker I welcome you here and

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,110
give a little housekeeping so we'll

18
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,490
probably were 300 people in the building

19
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,280
because we have the parents with the

20
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:14,250
kids kids program is next door if you do

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,930
not have a kid with you you can't go

22
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,670
there unless you're a volunteer

23
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,770
everybody should si can waive her

24

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:34,079
take care of that our first we do the

29
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:37,020
exponents tour and then a hacker village

30
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,979
which is filled with village people like

31
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,908
tool the tool is the lock-picking

32
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:43,530
organization that we work with every

33
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,000
here they've got a very big lock-picking

34
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,830
area so there's

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,480
interesting things and benders next door

36
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:51,000
and some swag we're going to have a

37
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,670

door prize I've got a drone we'll set it

39
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,770
up here later so you can see I've got a

40
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,660
fpv drone here for this and for the kids

41

get one let's see

45
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:17,220
we have been wolf Irfan wolf this sci-fi

46
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:18,809
fantasy supernatural author and he spoke

47
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,080
at our speaker dinner last night great

48
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:24,000
guy he and his wife Korea both authors

49
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,420
and they have a booth set up we bought

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,180
100 books fifty kid books will tell the

51
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,829
kids about fifty adult books he's going

52
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,750
to have book signing and he's got more

53
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,850
books to sell so he's going to be in the

54
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,080
explore area as well all right I don't

55
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,630
like I can't think of anything else but

56
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,030
I come back once in a while you know

57
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:44,280
remember something it's very you know so

58
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,430
our first speaker against gene Spafford

59
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,799
i've known gene for several years gene

60
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,860
has been in industry for a long time

61
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:56,400
better known staff and he's professor

62
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:59,760
for you and he's done many things over

63
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,079
many years and he has been convicted

64
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,159
and so he's going to be speaking today

65
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:06,730
on rethinking cybersecurity so spent

66
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:14,010
going down

67
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:20,349
Thanks down good morning everyone

68
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:21,429
wow that's a lot so one suggestion for

69
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:22,959
any of you are going to be listening the

70
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,840
speakers make sure your phones are on

71
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:29,650
mute that would be the polite thing to

72
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,470
do and also let me let me just note

73
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:35,079
having run various events

74
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:37,450
it may seem smooth but it's really

75
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:40,120
difficult and a lot of work so when you

76
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:44,010
see any of the people here who helped

77
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:47,980
organize this they say thank you to them

78
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:49,450
this presentation is based on my work

79
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:54,220
and the field of security which just

80
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:56,018
extends back about 40 years and one of

81
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,120
the last times they gave this was the

82
00:03:56,019 --> 00:04:00,519
leadership the National Security Agency

83
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,750
so you're getting you're getting an

84
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:03,280
interesting presentation

85
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,669
well they step up that's interesting

86
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,500
well so we'll see how it goes I am with

87
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:10,930
Purdue University I've been there 33

88
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:14,530
years I started the security center

89
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:18,220
there if any of you are interested in

90
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:20,320
issues of higher education getting a

91
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,470
degree in security or maybe their

92
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,810
children or grandchildren or neighbors

93
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:28,389
or whatever I'll be around that I'll be

94
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,970
happy to talk about that today then

95
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:34,169
maybe one on one or anything else they

96
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:36,940
want to talk about so let's start

97
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:39,099
security you know this is presumably

98
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,780
part of what corn comma is about is

99
00:04:39,099 --> 00:04:43,810
talking about particularly cyber

100
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,539
security and so if we're going to talk

101
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:50,620
about a computer system being secure

102
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:52,389
what does that really mean or if we talk

103
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:58,720
about security features that we want to

104
00:04:52,389 --> 00:05:01,630
protect or enhance what do we mean all

105
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:06,340
right so start with a working kind of

106
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:09,430
and we'll say and I think most people

107
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:11,229
would kind of repress that assist them

108
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,510
to secure if it's protected against

109
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:15,610
every kind of threat alright so if

110
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:18,520
you've got a system and there's some

111
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:20,140
threat out there that somebody tries to

112
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,440
exercise the against your system that

113
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:24,550
you stop it your system is secure

114
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,780
alright isn't does anybody think that

115
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:36,640
sounds like a bad bad way to represent

116
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:39,159
so we pull it out looks so yes so we'll

117
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,890
start and we'll say okay your average

118
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,590
computer system if you've set the

119
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:46,810
controls right you're up to date on

120
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:48,719
patches and you choose with passwords

121
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:52,200
and you do other things are supposed to

122
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:56,170
are we secure against random hackers

123
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:58,240
probably and I can't say that 100% but

124
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:00,700
probably we've gotten to the point where

125
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,860
those of us who had some security

126
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,830
training and background can keep out

127
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,360
random hackers

128
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:11,650
how about Melgar things like computer

129
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:14,320
viruses and ransomware probably if we

130
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:17,979
don't have people clicking on links and

131
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:20,110
email phishing or visiting some suspect

132
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:24,300
sites to download things we can probably

133
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:26,380
give out them our nation state hackers

134
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,070
okay so these are people who are

135
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:31,950
employed

136
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:38,159
trained funded by national governments

137
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:38,159
notable North Korea Iran Russia China

138
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:45,160
probably nobody in this room could keep

139
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:46,900
them out if they targeted you it is a

140
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,240
very difficult thing to do because they

141
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:53,219
have a lot of tools of knowledge and and

142
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:55,610
a lot of time on their hands

143
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:59,490
Ural invasions

144
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:01,530
probably not if any of you here are

145
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:05,250
confident you can repel one please let

146
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:09,690
me know the only person I know so far

147
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:13,320
Jeff Goldblum with a Mac but that was a

148
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:15,810
few years ago so now you know we

149
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:19,800
probably can't come secure systems

150
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:27,720
against that makes an extinction of n

151
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:30,990
meteor impact no probably not that that

152
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:35,190
would be a very bad day for computers as

153
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:40,740
well as pretty much everything else well

154
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:42,690
so for that meteor impact there are some

155
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,910
things we can do so for instance let's

156
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:48,170
push forward and establish colonies on

157
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:52,560
Mars and we'll put backups of all our

158
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:55,020
data computers at Mars there may be a

159
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,170
little delay in updating back and forth

160
00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:00,960
but you know that would protect against

161
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:05,490
a mere impact or a UFO invasion of Earth

162
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:07,710
right except eventually the heat death

163
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,720
of the Sun will cause it to expand as

164
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:13,109
Corona will envelop the inner planets

165
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:15,920
and again very bad day for Mars as well

166
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:19,620
as for the u.s. actually very bad

167
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:24,030
millennia for Mars and the u.s. Ernie

168
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:26,880
ahem the earth so no now we can't

169
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:29,549
protect against that either and this

170
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,140
shows a fundamental truth of security

171
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,200
that is not well understood by people

172
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:37,559
who don't study it very well or very

173
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:40,590
much is that security really is an

174
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:44,760
unachievable goal you cannot fully

175
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:46,500
secure any system against all threats it

176
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:52,740
is in fact an

177
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:56,280
and ever the idea is how much are we

178
00:08:52,740 --> 00:09:00,780
willing to spend to stop whatever

179
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:03,270
threats we can anticipate at a certain

180
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:07,020
point we simply say we have no more

181
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:10,140
budget sometimes we simply say we have

182
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:12,630
no more imagination but usually it's we

183
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:17,449
have no more budget and and we can't do

184
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:20,430
anything more to protect the system so

185
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:22,410
understanding that really goes to the

186
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:27,199
heart a lot of a lot of how we actually

187
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:30,990
do design and practice either security

188
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:33,330
interestingly fellow by the name of

189
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:36,270
Robert Courtney and I ask this in every

190
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:39,780
audience I expected less here anybody

191
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:42,660
ever be Robert Courtney okay

192
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:45,030
even in places like the National

193
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:48,030
Security Agency the National Science

194
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:49,520
Foundation when I asked this I get at

195
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:51,839
most one hand up

196
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:54,000
Robert Courtney was one of the first

197
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,490
cyber security specialist he won

198
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,070
national awards he was in charge of

199
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:02,490
security for IBM when IBM was the

200
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:07,170
computer company and he articulated

201
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:12,990
these three laws how you to turn the

202
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:15,329
bind disclosure so the first law is that

203
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:17,580
nothing useful about security can be

204
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:20,400
determined outside of a context in which

205
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:23,070
it's used and that really makes a lot of

206
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,850
sense because if we're going to talk

207
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:29,130
about the security of a system on board

208
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:32,520
the latest aircraft carrier versus a

209
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:34,320
computer that's in your kitchen that

210
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,839
threats are a little different the usage

211
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,730
the training and so if we're going to

212
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:39,260
talk about security we really need to

213
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:43,940
know something

214
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:48,530
that environment the second log is is

215
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:52,600
never spend more mitigating stopping a

216
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:55,160
risk than tolerating it would cost you

217
00:10:52,600 --> 00:11:00,110
this is why we do things like make

218
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:01,790
backups because we could certainly put a

219
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:04,910
whole lot of protections around our

220
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:07,370
systems but usually it really it's just

221
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:08,930
cheaper for the very rare occasion where

222
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:11,840
something goes wrong does restore from

223
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:14,060
backup and we do the same thing with

224
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:16,250
other uninterruptible power systems and

225
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:20,420
hot spares and a whole bunch of other

226
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:22,640
things that's a very important concept

227
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:24,500
and then the last one is particularly

228
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,310
important for all the people who are

229
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:32,000
really into the technology cyber

230
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:35,599
security is not simply technology it is

231
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,660
people it is laws it is policies there

232
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,000
are management solutions to technical

233
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:44,650
problems but there are no technical

234
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,780
solutions to management problems and

235
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:49,250
younger people tend to not understand

236
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:51,050
this as well as those of us who have

237
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:54,350
been around in various hierarchies for a

238
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:57,560
while management can make some really

239
00:11:54,350 --> 00:12:01,730
dumb decisions that we simply can't

240
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:04,579
carry out we can't possibly solve with

241
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:06,530
technology so when you think about

242
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:10,670
cybersecurity you have to think of it as

243
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:12,620
a systems property alright so I'm gonna

244
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,089
make another approach at defining

245
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:16,310
security and I'm going to actually go

246
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:20,300
back to work that was done scientific

247
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:24,260
work that was done in the 1980s and late

248
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,760
1970s about how to define security just

249
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,920
to give you an idea of some history

250
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:31,569
because a lot of people were considered

251
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:34,599
you don't realize some of the security

252
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:36,980
basically for an awful lot of people if

253
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,439
research was done before Google was in

254
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,769
bed

255
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:43,649
it doesn't exist and that's not true

256
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:45,509
that's particularly in this field so

257
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:47,849
let's talk about the idea of a computer

258
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:51,269
running along and doing whatever it's

259
00:12:47,849 --> 00:12:54,799
doing and it has memory locations and

260
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:58,769
it's got registers simplified view and

261
00:12:54,799 --> 00:13:01,439
in any instant in time there are values

262
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:03,959
in each of the memory cells and values

263
00:13:01,439 --> 00:13:06,049
in each of the registers and if we were

264
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:08,758
to make a long list of all those values

265
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:12,029
we can do that for every instance in

266
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:14,879
time and we can say whether or not those

267
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:18,779
values made up and allow the state of

268
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:23,059
the system is the system in a good state

269
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:23,059
that we're going to allow a secure state

270
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:30,359
because as the system progresses along

271
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:32,399
it changes state and what we can say is

272
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:34,470
if we go from one allowed state to

273
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,109
another allowed state that's a safe

274
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:38,729
operation the system is still secure

275
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:41,459
it's going from one good state to

276
00:13:38,729 --> 00:13:46,229
another good state that seems like a

277
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:49,709
really simple concept but it also

278
00:13:46,229 --> 00:13:51,929
implies we have bad States that is there

279
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:54,929
are some values that may end up in

280
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:58,409
memory or in registers that violate our

281
00:13:54,929 --> 00:14:00,569
rules it's a violation of our policies

282
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:02,220
is a bad state it's something we don't

283
00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:08,219
want to have happen because it's not

284
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:09,959
secured we especially don't want it to

285
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:13,169
get into one of those bad states and

286
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:15,419
then stay in bad states because that's

287
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:18,629
where really that problems occurred

288
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:20,069
where values get released and people

289
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:21,779
break in and gain an administrator

290
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:24,389
access and install things they shouldn't

291
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:27,199
and so on so we can define these good

292
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:27,199
states and dad States

293
00:14:27,229 --> 00:14:34,229
turns out formally if you study in

294
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:37,709
computing these mapped ideas that were

295
00:14:34,229 --> 00:14:39,659
developed in the 80s and are built now

296
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:42,268
into you formalisms

297
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:45,539
curricula I Triple E standards you her

298
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:49,319
guys have glia mentioned the idea of a

299
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:51,569
system specification describes all the

300
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:54,719
good states that a system should be in

301
00:14:51,569 --> 00:14:56,909
or can be honey and execution of the

302
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,959
state that isn't in the specification as

303
00:14:56,909 --> 00:15:03,989
them as a fault and that can result in a

304
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:06,299
failure that's when the system transits

305
00:15:03,989 --> 00:15:10,169
into one of those bad states and stays

306
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:13,049
there a failure in a protected system is

307
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:16,739
a security failure so we actually have a

308
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:19,379
kind of formal definition here of how

309
00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:22,709
the system can go from good state to a

310
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:25,019
bad state and it pens on some underlying

311
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:29,039
things like specification and I'll get

312
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:32,579
to that in a moment should note that we

313
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:34,799
also have undefined States undefined

314
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:37,439
states are ones that aren't really

315
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:40,249
defined in the specification but they're

316
00:15:37,439 --> 00:15:43,829
not really bad they just kind of ain't

317
00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:47,399
we don't really care a lot about fair

318
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:49,909
and specify but they couldn't lead to a

319
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:53,669
fault I mean it could be that the system

320
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:55,619
crashes and that you may not be a

321
00:15:53,669 --> 00:15:57,959
security failure and so in some cases

322
00:15:55,619 --> 00:15:59,609
it's just it's a bug it's a problem we

323
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:01,319
don't want to have happen so those are

324
00:15:59,609 --> 00:16:05,179
undefined states they're not really bad

325
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:05,179
but we may not not going to happen

326
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:11,339
some of them you know we might

327
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:15,299
temporarily go out of those bad states

328
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:16,619
and then go back into a good state but

329
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:19,169
because they're undefined we don't know

330
00:16:16,619 --> 00:16:20,699
we haven't thought about that well we

331
00:16:19,169 --> 00:16:24,119
don't really know what that behavior is

332
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:27,748
going to be this is what it probably

333
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:29,909
really looks like for most software most

334
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:31,499
of the time we have no idea whether the

335
00:16:29,909 --> 00:16:33,649
system is operating in a good state or

336
00:16:31,499 --> 00:16:33,649
not

337
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:42,959
and it's in that undefined state closely

338
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:45,870
because the software you use today in

339
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,750
almost every circumstance it has never

340
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:51,899
been defined it's never been specified

341
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:54,029
no one's ever said this is the correct

342
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:56,910
behavior this is the incorrect behavior

343
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:59,370
and these are the things in the program

344
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:03,810
that are supposed to detect and force

345
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:07,349
and work with it there's a notion of

346
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:09,629
formal specifications that is specifying

347
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:12,178
a computer system in a logical

348
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:16,470
mathematical fashion so that we can

349
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:19,819
exactly state what a good state is and

350
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:23,610
exactly state what a bad state is

351
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:26,339
unfortunately the methods we have now

352
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:29,879
work for time consuming they require

353
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:32,490
some advanced education they require a

354
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,010
lot of expertise to define and then the

355
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:39,809
tools to build the software from are

356
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:42,480
expensive and difficult to use but they

357
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:45,050
exist and you should be glad they exist

358
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,450
because those are used on things like

359
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:51,480
aircraft guidance systems space launches

360
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:52,679
nuclear power plants things that might

361
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,220
affect you a little bit if they were

362
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:57,570
wrong

363
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:59,700
and so do you know how to do this but it

364
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:02,250
cost a lot extra and it's not easy to do

365
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,350
and it's definitely not something you're

366
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,669
going to learn by just picking up a book

367
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:09,199
and reading through it on your own to

368
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:09,200
learn how to program over the weekend

369
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,309
which is what happens

370
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:22,949
right that one on the left you can go to

371
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:26,039
the bookstore you can buy these books on

372
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:29,669
the way here I heard a radio ad they

373
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:31,169
only saying don't like your job well you

374
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:33,000
can enroll in our course and in four

375
00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:37,009
months enter the exciting world of IT

376
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:42,389
becoming a master programmer for months

377
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:46,440
working weekends no that is not how you

378
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:49,049
learn to program well and in fact it

379
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,330
takes a lot of Advanced Study there are

380
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:53,730
people who can learn to program on their

381
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:57,689
own in fact maybe you may have done so

382
00:18:53,730 --> 00:19:00,179
but that does not mean that you learn

383
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:03,600
how to build safety critical or security

384
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:05,159
critical systems what happens in most

385
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,990
companies is very similar to on the

386
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:08,460
right and I realize this is an old

387
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:11,759
reference but people here in the

388
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:14,909
audience are a little bit more in that

389
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:17,759
realm if you remember Jurassic Park the

390
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:20,129
eccentric billionaire spent huge amounts

391
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:22,379
of money to buy an island and a reverse

392
00:19:20,129 --> 00:19:24,840
engineer the DNA of dinosaurs and build

393
00:19:22,379 --> 00:19:26,789
all kinds of dinosaurs and have them in

394
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:30,629
a big amusement park on the island and

395
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:33,269
his IT support team was this one guy who

396
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:37,289
a lot of Doritos and spilled coke into

397
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:39,850
the keyboard that is the way an awful

398
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:44,170
lot of commercial vendors and companies

399
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:49,290
operating the software you buy was

400
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:52,180
written by these people these people and

401
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:57,810
not really adequately thought through

402
00:19:52,180 --> 00:20:00,520
for security for safety for reliability

403
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:03,100
they weren't really defined other than

404
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:06,250
the first in market so we can gain the

405
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:08,709
market share if you if you've heard a

406
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:12,070
guy Kawasaki's line move fast and break

407
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:13,990
things that's really the idea I know a

408
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:15,730
lot of startups is just simply get the

409
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:18,730
first thing out there and we'll catch it

410
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:21,340
later so pretty much everything that you

411
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:23,470
you have is software has patches they

412
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:25,000
should record it regularly because they

413
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:26,760
didn't really take any care to get it

414
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,700
right the first time

415
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:33,940
in fact this really illustrates what

416
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:35,260
happens the quote on the left is one of

417
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,600
my favorite and again it goes back to

418
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:39,430
the 80s a program has not been specified

419
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:44,939
cannot be incorrect can only be

420
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:47,500
surprisingly your software is not wrong

421
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:50,380
it simply surprises you with its

422
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:53,200
behavior the fact that it discloses

423
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:57,340
passwords or let somebody else access to

424
00:20:53,200 --> 00:21:00,340
your data is a surprise it was never

425
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:04,149
part of the specification because the

426
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:06,790
communities was never specified they

427
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:09,670
never went through the formal process of

428
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:13,629
defining what the code should do instead

429
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:16,980
they wrote code to go to market and then

430
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:20,170
after people started buying it

431
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:22,540
they issued patches and came out with

432
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:25,090
version 2 and then version 3 and then

433
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,500
version 4 it started off as a laser

434
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:30,220
printer but ended after something like

435
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:33,100
this why because that's how they keep

436
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:35,560
their income stream if they sold you

437
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,270
something that was specified and correct

438
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,970
and it

439
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:42,870
fail and patches they would not make

440
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:45,390
another sale to you that really hurts

441
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:47,939
the bottom line which is what drives a

442
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:50,640
lot of companies and so they have to be

443
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:53,520
continually innovating and releasing

444
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,070
something that isn't well-defined is it

445
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,330
well specified and generally has

446
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:01,110
features that are going to cause you

447
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:09,570
problems it's the software equivalent of

448
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:11,250
this when I first saw this I can't I

449
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:13,950
can't even begin to capture what I

450
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:16,880
thought about this but I was talking

451
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:19,950
with somebody and they told me that

452
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:23,040
presumably they knew I don't know for

453
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:25,710
sure but this trouble light hanging from

454
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:28,530
those wires was put there by an engineer

455
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:31,550
doing debugging and discovered that

456
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:36,059
whenever he took the light off the wires

457
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:39,629
the systems not working and so they

458
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:41,160
leave the light there simply to keep the

459
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:42,510
system working because they didn't

460
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:46,050
nobody figure out where the problem

461
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:47,580
really was I can tell you from

462
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,710
experience on the experience of my

463
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:53,399
students and my colleagues that's the

464
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:55,170
way a lot of your code works is stuff is

465
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,690
in there that nobody wants to take out

466
00:22:55,170 --> 00:23:00,809
or tamper with I've seen comments that

467
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:04,520
say don't change this code we don't know

468
00:23:00,809 --> 00:23:04,520
what it does but things break

469
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:11,440
[Music]

470
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:13,928
yeah we working great it's like you

471
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:18,970
continue open it with an editor

472
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:20,559
that's breezy but that's still and part

473
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:23,830
of this is driven by the way the market

474
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:27,040
has evolved I think this is a big part

475
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:30,850
of the problem what happens is we're

476
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:32,590
caught in this sub cost lumen and if you

477
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:34,629
talk to people who do management you'll

478
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:38,050
see where this comes from but basically

479
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:41,350
what happens is we had we have a

480
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:44,678
hardware right we have a laptop PC on

481
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:46,330
our desktop we run things on it and we

482
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:48,820
add more data and the downloading our

483
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:53,949
software gets slower and slower and

484
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:56,439
slower so eventually we buy something

485
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:59,110
faster more memory faster processor

486
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:02,590
maybe it's got more discs or more online

487
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:04,120
SSD storage or whatever it is and now

488
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:06,459
it's really fast then it's got a lot of

489
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,860
capacity and it turns out that there's

490
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:10,690
software that we can buy for that that

491
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:13,059
the vendors anticipated we were going to

492
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:16,090
buy the new system the the newest

493
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:18,370
whatever it was and so what they do is

494
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:20,678
they produce new software for us to buy

495
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:22,750
or download which would put on our

496
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:24,340
system because it runs on your system

497
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:27,280
it's been designed to run on the same

498
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:29,050
system that we have and we keep doing

499
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,389
that until it gets slower and slower and

500
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:34,750
we have to buy any hardware but when we

501
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:38,470
buy the new hardware we generally end up

502
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:40,630
buying the same kind of hardware that we

503
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:42,280
have already because we have all this

504
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:45,220
software that we have to continue to

505
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:48,670
support and run it's too expensive to

506
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:50,500
switch to something else and when we go

507
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:51,970
to buy you software we have to buy

508
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:54,970
software that runs on the hardware we

509
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:58,000
have so we're stuck in his need we're

510
00:24:54,970 --> 00:25:02,170
constantly buying the same hardware

511
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:06,820
software platform Windows was designed

512
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:09,280
in 1987 we're still using 1987 software

513
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:12,159
basically blank that laser printer with

514
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:15,190
a lot of other stuff added on we don't

515
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,720
make innovations in better software or

516
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:19,529
saw

517
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:23,429
design from the beginning everything is

518
00:25:19,529 --> 00:25:27,720
tacked on afterwards I can tell you open

519
00:25:23,429 --> 00:25:29,610
source may be worse because we

520
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,190
frequently and if you look at the

521
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:34,529
statistics open source software is

522
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:37,049
constantly cracked having security

523
00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:39,200
failures and problems and what happens

524
00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:42,990
to the people who are open software

525
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,330
advocates gosh how did this happen when

526
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:48,350
we can all look at the software right

527
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:50,789
many eyes make bugs shallow supposedly

528
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:53,509
we can all see the software how could

529
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:57,690
this bug exist for the last 10 years

530
00:25:53,509 --> 00:26:01,200
somebody else as well let's fix it as

531
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:03,889
we're all using it and somebody else is

532
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,889
going again

533
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:09,269
open-source isn't any better and in some

534
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:12,928
cases it's worse actually over the last

535
00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:15,990
decade if you look at the reports of

536
00:26:12,929 --> 00:26:19,500
critical statistics the Microsoft kernel

537
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:22,590
is currently by far the most secure

538
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:28,259
operating system that you can easily get

539
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:30,000
your hands on and use behind that ESP is

540
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:31,980
better if you're looking for something

541
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,570
at low cost and if you're willing to pay

542
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,789
any money there's a company called green

543
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:37,769
hills that makes a system called

544
00:26:35,789 --> 00:26:40,980
integrity that's used in power plants

545
00:26:37,769 --> 00:26:43,860
and airplanes and so on it cost like six

546
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,549
hundred thousand dollars a copy but it's

547
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,439
worth it

548
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:50,519
if you're running a nuclear power plant

549
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:52,950
or an airplane or something else so we

550
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:54,600
have this problem again it's hardware

551
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:56,490
software we're committed to using this

552
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,980
software so we're stuck with all the

553
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:00,899
bugs and all people who aren't looking

554
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,740
for those security flaws because they're

555
00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:06,928
trying to figure out

556
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:09,090
or it to their new toaster so revisiting

557
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:11,540
cyber what what is it that we're doing

558
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:13,620
what is it they were really concerned

559
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:17,970
well we look to the Department of

560
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:20,820
Defense which is a questionable activity

561
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:26,970
for a lot of things but this is their

562
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:28,320
definition of cybersecurity prevention

563
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,790
of damage to protection of the

564
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,559
restoration of computers electronic

565
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,970
communication systems electronic

566
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:34,730
communication services wired

567
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:37,440
communication electronic communication

568
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:39,420
including information contained therein

569
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,460
to ensure its availability integrity

570
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:44,360
authentication confidentiality and

571
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:47,309
non-repudiation Wow

572
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:49,740
the Adi has just recently added to that

573
00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:53,309
all the aspects of psychological

574
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:56,460
information warfare it doesn't even fit

575
00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:57,928
on a page anymore I don't think that's a

576
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:02,070
definition that's going to help us a lot

577
00:27:57,929 --> 00:28:04,830
so here are some other definitions just

578
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:07,889
to give you the sense and I'll explain

579
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:10,800
in a minute but the first drop joist he

580
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:12,690
was the presidential cyber security

581
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,280
adviser for a while

582
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,990
cyber security is everything that

583
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,399
results in protecting information and

584
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:21,420
underlying technology from theft

585
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:23,220
manipulation and disruption okay I think

586
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:27,740
that's a reasonably good definition i

587
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:30,330
amplify the rule or the second one but

588
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:31,800
you know that's three deck and so far I

589
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:35,070
giving you five different kind of

590
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,790
definitions if you talk to any scholars

591
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:39,450
in the field

592
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:41,340
you'll four if you talk to you to ten

593
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:46,650
scholars in the field you will get

594
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:48,510
eleven definitions the truth is we do

595
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:52,410
not have a formal definition of

596
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:56,429
cybersecurity there is not one that we

597
00:28:52,410 --> 00:29:00,390
all agree with and that's part of the

598
00:28:56,429 --> 00:29:04,140
problem this was recognized back in the

599
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:04,720
80s and so part of the terminology

600
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,690
change

601
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:10,179
the 80s with groups talking about

602
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:11,169
assurance or trusted computing so

603
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:12,549
instead of saying that we were going to

604
00:29:11,169 --> 00:29:21,510
have a secure computer we're going to

605
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:24,750
have a trusted computer and then we said

606
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:28,289
you know we're going to assure the trust

607
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:30,970
and this is close to the definition of

608
00:29:28,289 --> 00:29:32,860
one that I came up with am making money

609
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:35,200
in one of my books with Simpson

610
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:37,178
Garfinkel which is basically the secure

611
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,539
system is one you can trust to do what

612
00:29:37,179 --> 00:29:42,940
you expect it to do and this actually I

613
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:44,770
recently found it is being taught in

614
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:46,960
college courses as the definition of

615
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:49,750
security so maybe there is some value to

616
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:53,230
that but it's not one everybody would

617
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:55,510
agree on so Trust was the next best

618
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:57,549
thing that we came up with in the 1980s

619
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:59,500
and if you've ever heard of the orange

620
00:29:57,549 --> 00:30:02,158
book or the rainbow series they were

621
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:06,039
trusted computer system evaluator

622
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:07,570
evaluation that was where the government

623
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:08,440
went in the eighties realizing we

624
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,789
couldn't get security

625
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,799
they candy basically went through this

626
00:30:09,789 --> 00:30:13,750
whole exercise that I just summarized

627
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:15,789
and realized we couldn't have a really

628
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:20,409
secure system so the next best was to

629
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:22,030
have trusted systems and these are all

630
00:30:20,409 --> 00:30:24,820
definitions of trust I'm not going to go

631
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:27,928
through it but but they all basically

632
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:31,330
say the same thing which is that we can

633
00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:33,429
trust we can put the things that value

634
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:37,689
with it and that we have reason to

635
00:30:33,429 --> 00:30:39,370
believe that it will be kept safe so

636
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:45,580
part of that has to do with trust

637
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:47,620
alignment if you think about it if you

638
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:51,309
look at any kind of computing system

639
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:53,229
there's an employer or company that has

640
00:30:51,309 --> 00:30:54,850
a set of goals and values what they want

641
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:56,760
to do usually those goals and values

642
00:30:54,850 --> 00:31:00,969
aren't make money

643
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:03,580
Society has goals and values which could

644
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:08,519
be protect a population or

645
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:10,658
the collect the taxes or could be

646
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:13,720
predict where hurricanes are going to go

647
00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:16,419
I don't know you have a set of values

648
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:18,970
that government supposedly holds forth

649
00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:23,950
and then you also have your individual

650
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:27,700
goals and values the ideal system to

651
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:29,889
trust is one where they own line where

652
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:32,409
my goals and values match my company's

653
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:35,498
goals and values match my society's

654
00:31:32,409 --> 00:31:38,679
goals and values but that is what

655
00:31:35,499 --> 00:31:41,200
happens we have this kind of situation

656
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:43,539
where I don't really quite believe what

657
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,869
my company is doing is ethical or right

658
00:31:43,539 --> 00:31:48,609
or is even a good idea the company is

659
00:31:46,869 --> 00:31:51,999
doing things that they want to evade the

660
00:31:48,609 --> 00:31:53,379
government and the government doesn't

661
00:31:51,999 --> 00:31:56,590
even know what they want this is

662
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:59,379
especially true with privacy what do we

663
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:01,299
do with personal information the

664
00:31:59,379 --> 00:32:03,459
government doesn't really have a

665
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:06,129
position at least the US government does

666
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:08,769
the European Union does with the GDP are

667
00:32:06,129 --> 00:32:11,350
our employer wants to collect or

668
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:13,269
companies like Amazon and Google and

669
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:15,488
Soma want to collect whatever

670
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:17,649
information they can to market and as

671
00:32:15,489 --> 00:32:20,139
individuals my goals and values are

672
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:22,418
perhaps to limit what they can gain

673
00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:24,789
access to these are maligned

674
00:32:22,419 --> 00:32:28,059
so therefore when you build the system

675
00:32:24,789 --> 00:32:32,139
that's going to support trust who's

676
00:32:28,059 --> 00:32:35,850
going to trust it whose trust model do

677
00:32:32,139 --> 00:32:39,100
we build to that's not well defined

678
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:41,559
again we've been that field is 50 years

679
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:44,320
old we still don't know how to do these

680
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:47,889
things in a reliable way that would

681
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:52,559
suppress them completely and the

682
00:32:47,889 --> 00:32:56,248
mechanism is just don't exist and

683
00:32:52,559 --> 00:33:01,149
compounding trust the levels of trust

684
00:32:56,249 --> 00:33:04,269
supply chain my system isn't all built

685
00:33:01,149 --> 00:33:06,919
by me I don't build and design the

686
00:33:04,269 --> 00:33:09,780
silicon that goes

687
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:12,780
system.the the computer chips the

688
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:14,460
peripherals the wiring as well as a lot

689
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:17,430
of the software in the operating system

690
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:21,270
I've got to trust other people well how

691
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:24,480
do I know that they're trustworthy what

692
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:32,220
have they done to prove to me that what

693
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:35,010
they built is to my level of trust it's

694
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:38,250
not trust but it's Turtles if you trust

695
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:40,140
her totally this is a good picture but

696
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:44,940
we have this problem of composable trust

697
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:50,850
with supply chain and this brings me to

698
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:51,960
here Lord Kelvin scientists 1800s said

699
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:53,969
when you get to engineer what you're

700
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,520
speaking about and express it in numbers

701
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:58,500
you know something about it but you

702
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:00,660
cannot measure it you cannot express it

703
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:03,300
in numbers your knowledge is a meagre

704
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:05,490
and unsatisfactory kind maybe the

705
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:08,310
beginning of knowledge but you have

706
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:12,120
scarcely in your thoughts advanced to

707
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:14,279
the stage of science that has tremendous

708
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:18,569
meaning for us in security because we

709
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:25,250
have no metrics the only metrics we have

710
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:27,710
our dollars gigabytes and megahertz

711
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:30,739
those are what we use to make decisions

712
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:34,260
those are not security metrics and

713
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:35,909
therefore we have a disconnect in and

714
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:39,360
how we talk about security and build

715
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:43,250
systems if we're going to build a bridge

716
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:45,990
or a car or a house or anything we have

717
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:48,300
units of measure and we have devices to

718
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:51,239
do the measurement we have nothing like

719
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:52,890
that in security in fact we don't even

720
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:55,319
have things that we can talk about that

721
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:58,230
we can measure so if you've looked at

722
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,300
traditional computer security courses or

723
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:02,360
cybersecurity courses they talk about

724
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,530
this triad is confidentiality

725
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,600
availability

726
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:11,540
integrity as being these security

727
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:12,680
properties they're awful for a lot of

728
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:14,240
reasons I mean we're going to go into

729
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,040
you here because I'm not going to turn

730
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,899
this into an academic lecture but I will

731
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,840
tell you they were designed by Bob

732
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:24,050
Courtney the person you hadn't heard of

733
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:27,710
prior to this and he designed them 20

734
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:29,390
minutes before a sales meeting he was

735
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:30,710
told that he had to tell all the IBM

736
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:35,270
sales engineer about the new security

737
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:37,280
features in the IBM 370 well he thought

738
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:41,300
about it he took a piece of transparency

739
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,620
of celluloid which I looking around the

740
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:45,020
room a lot of you have no idea what I'm

741
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:47,870
talking about but with a marker he wrote

742
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:50,270
on it this CIA do a triangle like this

743
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:53,420
with these things on it and he presented

744
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:55,130
it as the CIA model of security and the

745
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:57,860
signals engineers loved it because of

746
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:59,720
the CIA bit they got to go tell their

747
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:03,410
customers that they were supporting CIA

748
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:08,560
in their products that's where it came

749
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:11,899
from it has no scientific foundation

750
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:15,620
it's a good model because those are

751
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:17,240
orthogonal that is you can change one

752
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:20,810
and that affects the other they're not

753
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:23,270
independent you can disable one and it

754
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:24,950
affects the other two and there's and

755
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:27,440
there's no national measure give me two

756
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:30,450
more units of integrity what does that

757
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,849
mean you have absolutely no

758
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:35,399
for those I would contend that

759
00:36:32,849 --> 00:36:37,230
everywhere you see in confidentiality

760
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,420
integrity and availability talked about

761
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,079
as measures if you use

762
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:43,079
rock-paper-scissors that would put just

763
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:45,650
as meaningful because it really doesn't

764
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:45,650
mean anything

765
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:52,530
how many very dumb Parker okay

766
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,960
another pioneer in the field and he

767
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:57,859
addressed the Triad came up with this

768
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,119
hex ad as a way to add some new features

769
00:36:57,859 --> 00:37:01,710
suffers from the same problems I'm not

770
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:02,910
going to go into it you can look it up

771
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:06,030
online if you're interested in the

772
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:08,720
Wikipedia or otherwise it's useful to

773
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:12,329
talk about systems but it's not complete

774
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:15,060
so what do we need well we need

775
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:17,130
fundamental properties correctness is

776
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:19,799
one of them - if we give you the right

777
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:21,570
correct software we'd be way ahead of

778
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,820
the game because so many of the problems

779
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:25,760
are simply from faults and problems in

780
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:27,900
the software not being built correctly

781
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:31,260
without that it's difficult to say a

782
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:33,050
whole lot of anything else but then

783
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:36,329
there are other things like simplicity

784
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:38,790
specificity limited interactions

785
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:40,230
containment words that you may or may

786
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,550
not have heard of if you've taken any

787
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:43,829
kind of course in software engineering

788
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:47,690
or security but they're well-known

789
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:51,690
problem properties in software design

790
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:56,490
there's some other features access

791
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:58,200
control glue interfaces oh my gosh if

792
00:37:56,490 --> 00:38:00,169
you ever try and figure out how to do

793
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:04,710
firewall settings or something on a

794
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:07,680
typical system you have to have a jargon

795
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:09,060
dictionary and the set of charts just to

796
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,160
figure out what the heck it is that's

797
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:12,690
going on configuring the systems is

798
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:15,299
talented

799
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:17,339
we have resilient tender modes if

800
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:20,849
something breaks the whole system just

801
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:23,220
it shouldn't fail if steady should fall

802
00:38:20,849 --> 00:38:26,010
back it's like one flat tires on your

803
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:27,959
car if you get blowup and the tire

804
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:30,599
doesn't mean suddenly you swerve off the

805
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,099
side of the road it means a light comes

806
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,599
on in the dash and now you've got to

807
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:37,260
drive a little more slowly to you get it

808
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:40,710
fixed that's that's a failure resistant

809
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:44,190
kind of system assuming you're you know

810
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:45,869
driving a relatively recent car I'm not

811
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:48,119
sure how that works on motorcyclists but

812
00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:51,089
that's that's a different kind of

813
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:53,839
failure mode we need things like

814
00:38:51,089 --> 00:38:57,779
identification and tagging of data

815
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:59,520
hardened features with crypto auditing

816
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:01,619
and then a whole bunch of things we need

817
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:04,650
and I'm not gonna go through the whole

818
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:06,960
list but I took a bunch of slides out

819
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:09,480
here because of it was a different

820
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,420
audience but these are all research

821
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:16,230
problem areas that we do not know how to

822
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:18,390
solve these are basics in the area of

823
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:20,130
security we are at the point where civil

824
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:24,359
engineers were before they had invent

825
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:26,280
the red triangle we are Optimus we are

826
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:29,369
throwing things together in systems to

827
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:31,260
see if they work but we don't know why

828
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:35,760
they work and we don't understand why

829
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:37,859
they think we're not comes or often

830
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,660
we're janitors because something went

831
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:43,770
wrong and we've got to clean up on aisle

832
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:45,170
five so I can't give you a complete list

833
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:47,730
it's a long list

834
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:51,089
it's a research agenda that needs to be

835
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:53,250
funded and and followed but too much of

836
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:55,140
the money is deployed into you fixing

837
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:57,960
the latest problem the latest set of

838
00:39:55,140 --> 00:40:00,089
buzzwords right we got all the money

839
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:03,230
going right now into black chain and

840
00:40:00,089 --> 00:40:06,660
zero trust wow those are the big things

841
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:08,010
blockchain is basically worthless I'll

842
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,990
tell you that from a scientific

843
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:12,750
standpoint it's interesting academically

844
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:15,180
but certainly don't got any money on it

845
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:16,740
and zero Trust is an idea that's been

846
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:19,649
around for thirty years and used with

847
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:23,189
different names but they're the hot

848
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:27,300
marketing terms currently we need to do

849
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:29,070
a better job of this so any of you who

850
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,540
are interested in in the field

851
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:34,350
dancing the field rather than just

852
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:35,670
practicing some of the concepts you know

853
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:38,759
there are problems here that could be

854
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:42,090
solved so let me give you a couple of

855
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:43,410
takeaways and finish up I got started a

856
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:47,580
little late so I'm running a little late

857
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:51,720
and I apologize you can buy one of these

858
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:52,890
things on Amazon I think the last time I

859
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:57,509
looked the price was a little over a

860
00:40:52,890 --> 00:41:00,270
thousand dollars it has every tool plus

861
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:02,820
worn that linger makes winters the

862
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:04,590
company that makes these we don't

863
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:06,150
publish Swiss Army knife because no

864
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:09,330
self-respecting member of the Swiss

865
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:12,750
military would carry one of these but it

866
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:17,100
has pretty much everything on it you can

867
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:20,400
build a house with one of these it has

868
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:24,150
all the necessary tools you have to use

869
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:27,180
a handle is a hammer but every tool so

870
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:34,890
on a screwdriver nut-driver drill

871
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:36,419
they're all there would you want to you

872
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:38,759
could but it probably wouldn't be very

873
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:40,950
good quality would take a long time and

874
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:47,460
you invent a whole lot of new curse

875
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:55,439
words it's a problem and yet think about

876
00:41:47,460 --> 00:42:00,510
what we do in computing C++ windows web

877
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:03,510
browsers Intel architectures they do

878
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:06,690
everything that's how we build them we

879
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:10,410
do not build tools to specific purposes

880
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:12,570
because the market isn't as good instead

881
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:15,960
we build these monstrosity that do

882
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:18,690
everything but really do nothing well

883
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:23,130
and that's part of the problem as well

884
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:24,720
is we are so so busy using these be

885
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:26,700
building these tools that everybody can

886
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,730
use that we don't think about are they

887
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:31,319
really appropriate to use and as a

888
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:33,570
result they have a lot of extra side

889
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:35,300
effects a lot of extra problems that

890
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:37,280
occur too on them along the way because

891
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:40,339
they're too big

892
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:43,920
and this goes back to Courtney's laws

893
00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:45,750
and really this is an illustration we

894
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,670
need a management solution here it's not

895
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:48,810
about a technical problem it's a

896
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:52,170
management problem

897
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:59,640
so it's an economics problem and we have

898
00:42:52,170 --> 00:43:01,410
to understand that quality first if

899
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:03,509
there's one thing I can get across to

900
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:06,598
the people who build software it's

901
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:09,570
design it think it through and building

902
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:14,849
quality first there are some things they

903
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:17,430
simply don't patch well second whatever

904
00:43:14,849 --> 00:43:18,720
you build is what you're stuck with so

905
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:22,230
you better be sure that what you build

906
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:26,040
is what you want and it's the special

907
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:27,930
cases that will get you 23 hours out of

908
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:32,430
the day this is a great porch to go sit

909
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:37,470
on that one hour can be traumatic

910
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:39,299
however a lot of software's like that if

911
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:41,339
they build the typical case and don't

912
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:46,500
think about the exceptional one you have

913
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:50,279
problems security cannot be an add-on it

914
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:52,349
needs to be designed in simply throwing

915
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:57,180
up a firewall or installing antivirus

916
00:43:52,349 --> 00:43:58,950
does not make a system secure what would

917
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:05,879
even better is that science had beware

918
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:09,689
of dog so the question I pose to you and

919
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:12,060
I pose to all my audiences is how are we

920
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:14,520
going to define security I don't mean a

921
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:16,529
definition in words I mean a definition

922
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,349
in practice how are we going to build

923
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:21,869
our systems to be secure what is it

924
00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:25,319
we're going to measure what is it we're

925
00:44:21,869 --> 00:44:27,990
going to insist is present if we don't

926
00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:29,940
do a better job than the people who buy

927
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:32,549
systems whether they're in government

928
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:34,950
where companies or nonprofits are going

929
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:38,520
to have to buy on the only metrics they

930
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:41,368
have available gigahertz megabytes and

931
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:43,410
dollars and none of those relate to

932
00:44:41,369 --> 00:44:48,960
security and none of those relate to

933
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:52,799
privacy and that's the future thank you

934
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:56,190
for your attention I think you knew for

935
00:44:52,800 --> 00:45:01,920
a break here if I reading this correctly

936
00:44:56,190 --> 00:45:03,720
Oh in five minutes so I have time for

937
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,420
one or two questions but I'll be around

938
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:11,810
all day so any questions or anything yes

939
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:11,810
sir yes

940
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:32,499
so great pressure repeated the recipe to

941
00:45:29,229 --> 00:45:34,718
hyuna's when I say quality first how do

942
00:45:32,499 --> 00:45:35,948
i reconcile that with the fact that when

943
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:38,979
I said that Microsoft had the most

944
00:45:35,949 --> 00:45:42,729
secure kernel at the same time when the

945
00:45:38,979 --> 00:45:46,839
dela took over CEO he basically really

946
00:45:42,729 --> 00:45:49,799
hindered the QA teams part of that is

947
00:45:46,839 --> 00:45:52,420
the kernel hasn't changed drastically

948
00:45:49,799 --> 00:45:55,749
since it was first went through the

949
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:58,299
process the QA team that developed the

950
00:45:55,749 --> 00:46:00,399
software development lifecycle built in

951
00:45:58,299 --> 00:46:02,499
a set of processes that are now part of

952
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,400
development and so there is a certain

953
00:46:02,499 --> 00:46:07,598
momentum going forward on the common

954
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:10,170
most of the security problems with

955
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:13,630
Microsoft products right now are

956
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:16,119
applications they're add-ons they're not

957
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:19,119
to come and that's where part of the

958
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:20,469
problem comes in is that QA team can in

959
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,420
fact much of the research and the

960
00:46:20,469 --> 00:46:24,190
security team was done away with as a

961
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:27,729
cost measure because they can measure

962
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:30,430
cost and as a result a lot of the newer

963
00:46:27,729 --> 00:46:34,029
products that are add-ons to Microsoft

964
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:37,529
products are where the problems lie good

965
00:46:34,029 --> 00:46:37,529
question in the back sir

966
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:51,430
the company came with a product called

967
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:55,029
XP flight engineers pulled all the

968
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:58,060
unnecessary functionality out of XP to

969
00:46:55,030 --> 00:47:00,790
make it a lot Bloodless attack surface

970
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:08,620
we use it for kiosks and much more

971
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:23,590
stable of workstations with truth I'm

972
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:24,700
not sure so a great question how we beat

973
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:27,730
that

974
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:31,419
when XP was was the dominant system and

975
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:33,280
in some places still is Microsoft we

976
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:35,950
created an XP link that could be used in

977
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,900
things like kiosks and self-driven kinds

978
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:39,430
of systems where they pulled out a lot

979
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:43,150
of functionality and it's supposed to

980
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:45,549
have a lower footprint and and how is

981
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:47,860
that as a general principle the reason

982
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:49,960
XP like didn't really succeed is first

983
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:52,930
of all they didn't charge a lot less for

984
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:55,750
it and so people were looking at buying

985
00:47:52,930 --> 00:48:00,910
and say well why should I pay 90% of the

986
00:47:55,750 --> 00:48:05,080
cost for 70% of the system and that was

987
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:07,720
part of the part of the problem and the

988
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:10,509
maintenance teams as patches came along

989
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:12,430
and his upgrades it was unsustainable so

990
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:13,390
they just dissing it they discontinued

991
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:15,850
it

992
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:17,950
you may remember Windows CE easy as

993
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:21,700
another attempt to do something like

994
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:24,160
that that also failed except unless

995
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,720
you're using D re voting machines and

996
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,960
some of those are still running XP light

997
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:31,750
and Windows CE E which is an abomination

998
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:34,089
and we should all be really upset that

999
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:38,109
our government is refusing to act to

1000
00:48:34,089 --> 00:48:40,290
secure our voting machines however would

1001
00:48:38,109 --> 00:48:43,598
that be a good idea for existing systems

1002
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:47,140
it is being done in some respects with

1003
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:50,890
some versions of Linux and Android there

1004
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:52,770
are attempts to pull out subsets some

1005
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:55,900
are more successful than others

1006
00:48:52,770 --> 00:49:00,099
anything that's derived off of SELinux

1007
00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:01,540
tends to be better SELinux was designed

1008
00:49:00,099 --> 00:49:03,760
with some of the properties I was

1009
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:08,230
talking about for high assurance by a

1010
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:10,119
group at the NSA but it is difficult to

1011
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:11,890
do because if you pull some things out

1012
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:13,599
other things stop working and then you

1013
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:17,170
gotta make patches and you don't know

1014
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:18,640
what the effect that those are generally

1015
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:19,300
building something from the bottom up

1016
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:22,480
works better

1017
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:28,079
so Android originally was like that that

1018
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:30,190
was a atlas of every system until we got

1019
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,809
8700 different versions and everybody

1020
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:35,140
started adding and we're around other

1021
00:49:31,809 --> 00:49:37,299
kinds of things to it trying to build

1022
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:40,319
narrow systems for narrow purposes is

1023
00:49:37,299 --> 00:49:44,530
generally a good idea that's why

1024
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:46,569
airplanes don't want old windows in fact

1025
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:49,180
they don't when windows at all and we

1026
00:49:46,569 --> 00:49:52,599
have trusted them your microwave ovens

1027
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:56,049
up until recently did not run Linux or

1028
00:49:52,599 --> 00:49:57,670
Windows or Android and we had presumably

1029
00:49:56,049 --> 00:50:01,119
trust in them that they were going to

1030
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:04,859
blow up you can now buy refrigerators

1031
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:08,410
that run Linux I kind of questioned why

1032
00:50:04,859 --> 00:50:12,308
the best story I heard about that just

1033
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:14,589
briefly is that any superstore applying

1034
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:15,530
superstore somewhere the the said they

1035
00:50:14,589 --> 00:50:17,090
had very few sales

1036
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:19,100
people on this store and somebody was

1037
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:20,990
busy helping customers and when they

1038
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:23,750
came back out they find that all of the

1039
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:30,040
Linux refrigerators you know big bright

1040
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:30,040
LED screens held and tuned to form up

1041
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:34,670
the shopping experience was very

1042
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:38,000
different I think for many of the

1043
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:39,500
customers at that place so maybe there

1044
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:44,540
are kids that use case for that on

1045
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:46,910
refrigerators I don't know but I am uh I

1046
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:50,210
am a believer that building more

1047
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:53,330
functional specified kind of systems for

1048
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:55,100
a purpose is a better way but it's more

1049
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:56,569
expensive and we've all gotten used to

1050
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:58,940
the idea that we want everything to be

1051
00:50:56,570 --> 00:51:03,170
cheap it's why every drum that you buy

1052
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:05,390
runs runs Android or Linux it's because

1053
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:07,250
it's free and it means that they also

1054
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:13,580
were although will being taken over and

1055
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:17,260
damaged so on I can take one more short

1056
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:17,259
question if there is one yes sir

1057
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:37,550
so how do I see if I repeat this

1058
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:41,960
correctly how do we deal with systems

1059
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:43,940
that have an interacting requirements

1060
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:45,680
that interact both with the system and

1061
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:49,240
the applications and the environments

1062
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:49,240
they're running is that a fair statement

1063
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,770
[Music]

1064
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:04,770
ah

1065
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,830
okay so the plane I had talked about

1066
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:20,230
where we need to be able to quantify and

1067
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:21,700
measure things individually but how we

1068
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:24,310
deal with that the fact they have to

1069
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:25,839
interact in systems and the way that's

1070
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:29,290
done is by having clearly defined

1071
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:31,300
interfaces so that we know exactly where

1072
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:33,490
the inputs enough lets go and exactly

1073
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:35,590
what their behavior is supposed to be so

1074
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:39,129
that we can reduce them to those

1075
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:41,590
interfaces that's not a simple thing to

1076
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:42,670
do if we know how to do it we've done it

1077
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:47,280
before

1078
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:51,130
NASA summit FAA does it do it does it

1079
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:53,520
but it is difficult to do and it gets

1080
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:57,400
more complicated as we add more

1081
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:59,140
requirements to do more things we have

1082
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:01,450
this mindset that everything should be

1083
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:05,140
done by the processor we have on our

1084
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:07,600
desk but we now can we I just saw an

1085
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:11,460
article a vendor has made a computer

1086
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:14,710
chip with 400,000 computing corners on

1087
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:17,980
the idea of doing time swapping time

1088
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:21,930
splicing on a system it has 400,000

1089
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:25,510
cores is ridiculous we can put a

1090
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:26,680
terabyte of memory on a chip why are we

1091
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:28,120
using virtual memory

1092
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:31,000
I mean there are a number of things like

1093
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:33,069
this that make lives more difficult

1094
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,780
because we fail to actually think what

1095
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:37,630
are the requirements that we want to

1096
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:39,430
specify a separate and do we in fact

1097
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:41,470
need to have those things interact the

1098
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:44,890
way they do so there's some fundamental

1099
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:46,870
questions there that would take a much

1100
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:50,290
longer answer but hopefully that gives

1101
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:51,549
you a hint thank you very much for your

1102
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:53,710
attention I hope you have a wonderful

1103
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:57,120
day I'll be around I'll be happy to talk

1104
00:53:53,710 --> 00:54:01,080
to anybody about pretty much anything

1105
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:01,080
for the remainder of the day so

1106
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:09,429
[Applause]
