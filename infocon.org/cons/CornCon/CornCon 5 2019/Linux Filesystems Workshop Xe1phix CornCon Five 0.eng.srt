1
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:27,390
it's your smile systems all right I'm

2
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,390
Celtics

3
00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:44,979
so there's my release put it out much

4
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:46,718
the next three weekly video tutorials

5
00:00:44,979 --> 00:00:49,780
and stuff like that so Louie groans

6
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,909
there you find my slides they posted it

7
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,430
on the compound site I made three

8
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:57,339
different cheat sheets one for zfx 1/4

9
00:00:54,430 --> 00:01:00,489
XFX one for feature test and my slides

10
00:00:57,339 --> 00:01:04,330
are also posted there so everything I'm

11
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:07,149
doing here is you need fifty kind of

12
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:09,610
best base program alive there's going to

13
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:14,350
be syntax but all of this on my cat lab

14
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:17,020
and all URLs are posted all right so I

15
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:20,288
am certified as the Lynx Administration

16
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:21,890
just past that I'll take two a one when

17
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:24,530
it's engineer and look out

18
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:27,260
- right now that were print is be doing

19
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:30,940
like a deal and stuff like that on one

20
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:34,310
side I like to study memory forensics

21
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:36,679
about our houses anchoring our game and

22
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:42,650
stuff like that which you know new

23
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:44,240
contact me directly to tell the grand

24
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:48,410
vaccinations but that's slightly shorter

25
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:51,800
in a manner where it might get loud was

26
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:53,500
the last one there closely source pillow

27
00:01:51,800 --> 00:02:01,910
stuff like that most of it's just like

28
00:01:53,500 --> 00:02:02,990
automation to someone that like there's

29
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,490
time to see that cover at three

30
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,460
different file systems that I found the

31
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:13,750
most interesting GFS which is a feature

32
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:17,120
of BSD project ETFs and excellence so

33
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:20,290
and there's there's a lot more cover

34
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,290
here I just didn't have enough room

35
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:30,060
and you find then to talk me out and

36
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,400
that's very end all have just kind of

37
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,510
like a few different like tools linspace

38
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,510
tools out cover

39
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:46,540
website so like I said just those three

40
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,190
processes and there are a bunch of Linux

41
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:52,989
file system to see they're just a cute

42
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:55,690
name you get healthy on which is like

43
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:57,460
very standardized that you're they

44
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:00,820
install things you were at being or

45
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:04,930
something like that loop use those are

46
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:08,980
life virtual based on systems then EFS

47
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:11,620
PW out those are like forensics base

48
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:15,609
file systems we do in forensics

49
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:18,280
acquisition that it is no file system

50
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:23,800
and the last one is a virtual file

51
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:26,260
system so this is the storage that

52
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,240
there's a two parts here but it's just

53
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:33,959
kind of give an example of like how

54
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:37,540
large the links subsystem is

55
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:43,750
second part I scuzzy is like Network

56
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:50,459
file system here those video from

57
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:54,579
virtual file systems so first we recover

58
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:56,680
CFS so these listen to three different

59
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:59,170
URLs that have the video and it goes

60
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,939
through everything I'm doing and does it

61
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:06,909
like verbatim syntax what that output is

62
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:08,530
stuff like that and it's about at the

63
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:11,530
bottom you notice when covering

64
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:14,560
different topics that's the get lab the

65
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:17,589
chichi at bad URL so go through CMS

66
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:22,139
betrayer fest XFS so I'm on that topic

67
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:22,138
that would they grow for that time

68
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,860
alright so

69
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:39,090
you see that I'm right okay so CSS

70
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:42,300
there's so many different features it's

71
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:46,739
a CFS to start with here you got like a

72
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:52,980
CLS so access controls give extended

73
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:57,710
attributes delegated permissions since

74
00:04:52,980 --> 00:05:00,620
ZFS is a BSD based file system you have

75
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:04,739
some restrictions and stuff like that

76
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:09,650
which is ported to Linux so it works

77
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:13,410
through ZFS every file system read-only

78
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:17,010
and there's there's three different ages

79
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:22,770
of different feature cfengine so there's

80
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:24,630
a lot of leveraged etfs ZFS is very

81
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:27,630
difficult to start it because you need

82
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:30,630
to recompile the kernel and the kernel

83
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:32,610
model so I don't know who here is

84
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,730
reading pearl recompile of the live

85
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:39,090
eternal okay got a couple people here is

86
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:40,440
not easy task for beginners so like I

87
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:43,200
said if you want to contact me directly

88
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,650
I can walk you through that there might

89
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:50,520
tell you're an animal

90
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:55,650
so more features here we have sha

91
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:57,359
adjusting so check some will go farther

92
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:59,909
into that and they're interesting you

93
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,740
have here's little box so replicated

94
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:04,710
metadata so we can read

95
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:10,590
selfish metadata it's corrupt like I

96
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:13,349
said into that snapshotting the cool

97
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:15,719
thing was DFS and we'll cover this more

98
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:19,349
in feelings time it would CFS but you

99
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,660
can send snapshots over the internet so

100
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:24,120
you can snapshot something and sent it

101
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,590
to a machine halfway across over halfway

102
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,020
across the world and they can rebuild

103
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:30,719
everything that's pretty crazy

104
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:34,770
you have rollbacks us on the interstate

105
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:38,430
my port where someone was using CFS as

106
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:40,830
like the foundation for like reverting

107
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:43,800
back when you get like I did with like

108
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:47,490
that and stuff like that and it showed

109
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,830
that like kinda like they used it in the

110
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:53,220
way you would have a virtual file like a

111
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:54,960
VM so like VirtualBox or VMware where it

112
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,360
affected used to revert back to the

113
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,479
previous instance and you're not

114
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,970
affected so they used that idea that CFS

115
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:07,020
roll backs and it worked tremendously

116
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:08,969
well and then again as DFS quotas so

117
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:12,180
it's just like limiting the amount of

118
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:13,610
space that like a user group or dish can

119
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:17,050
use

120
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:20,410
okay so

121
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:23,830
this is how CSS works it's different

122
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:26,139
than other file systems and I stole this

123
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:28,240
directly from scale so their talk is

124
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:30,639
amazing if you find ZFS interesting

125
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:35,620
watch that talk it's from the ZFS

126
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:37,960
developers they're incredible so to

127
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:42,849
bring it down basically at a spot bottom

128
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:46,180
and this GFS is designed to be arrayed

129
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:48,039
basically so if you have several discs

130
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:51,550
and they have something called a C rate

131
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:55,560
or you're able to rebuild like broken

132
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:58,690
areas and you know it's with other discs

133
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:02,169
so basically what the squad does the

134
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:05,849
plate like five disks so let's take

135
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:08,380
those five disks and make that as

136
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:10,900
restorative and then you're in the

137
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:15,669
middle the GIMP you they took the idea

138
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:18,698
of databases and it says I even wrote

139
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:22,948
this or I didn't is it free and it shows

140
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:28,630
like when process is complete so it

141
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:30,250
makes it so like if you pull out disk or

142
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:33,099
a power drops or something like that

143
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:35,919
it's able to tell what happened at what

144
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:40,270
time so them to rebuild things then at

145
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,929
the top you have the CFL which is that

146
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:46,350
posted

147
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:49,750
so hostess is like in old eunuchs Turner

148
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:56,710
so basically what that does is it's a

149
00:08:49,750 --> 00:09:00,220
file image so that's and would CFS you

150
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:05,650
have a seat and the seat pool is

151
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:09,400
basically I don't know who's familiar

152
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:15,310
with the LVM the seat pool basically is

153
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:15,760
the virtual virtual layer of one step

154
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:18,939
further

155
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,880
but basically you make this equal that

156
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:27,820
we're told here and then the CFS lays on

157
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:32,439
top of that so this is kind of breaking

158
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:34,180
down no field they just said the

159
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:39,430
interesting thing with this spot

160
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:42,579
actually gets assigned it's it creates

161
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:45,449
the block corner and assigns like tokens

162
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,450
to that one

163
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:55,730
so try acronyms again CFS datasets or

164
00:09:52,460 --> 00:10:01,900
just amount points D balls and watch

165
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:01,900
vices didn't wash but data agency there

166
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:12,699
so it's a pretty common cat you can get

167
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:13,899
Plagueis I can get my slides so I'm

168
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:19,719
going to try to speed this up because I

169
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:22,089
got any four slides so alright so there

170
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:25,269
are seven different it's every different

171
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:28,779
types of v-dubs which is like I said two

172
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:32,589
virtual devices like this file here

173
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:37,120
brain spare so those are the different

174
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:42,310
kinds of assignments you can give the

175
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:47,009
disks so most interesting thing about

176
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:50,859
GFS is a self-healing file system or so

177
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:55,630
where you're able to rebuild them from

178
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:57,300
other days but it's I'll go further into

179
00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:00,269
it later

180
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:04,750
but that's the most interesting aspect

181
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:07,360
of it so here's why so the offence is

182
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:10,360
something called myrtle trees so the ZFS

183
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,519
which it is hash summoning all the way

184
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,160
down I'll show you the Internet's all

185
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:19,540
the way down the tree it verifies

186
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:21,880
integrity all the way down to all the

187
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:26,459
way down and up all in the uber block

188
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:29,020
which are the very top of the file tree

189
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:33,069
so

190
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:36,399
like this is regular blocks like healthy

191
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:40,750
and ext4 stuff like that we're gonna

192
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:42,760
check some but unlike that GFS all the

193
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:45,459
way up the trees public the Cooper block

194
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,899
which should be up here everything is

195
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:49,899
have sucked and whenever you change

196
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:53,200
David up here all these checks having to

197
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:56,740
be changed so that I'd say this one here

198
00:11:53,200 --> 00:12:00,310
it's corrupt it can be repaired with one

199
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:10,839
piece to here it's not basically

200
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:12,609
blockchain the other stuff that CFS has

201
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:17,500
been around since the late eighties

202
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:21,190
early nineties yeah point three is the

203
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,990
data file system there's a lot of

204
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:27,430
development like when I was ready to

205
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:29,529
start they added like sixty features so

206
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:34,260
this was were warned to like a local

207
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:40,089
trade and what it does so protecting us

208
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:42,670
mr. IP rights all metadata is stored

209
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:46,829
twice and I'll go further into this you

210
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,829
can actually create several copies of

211
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:55,109
so the next kind of terminal to bring

212
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,940
out is CFS uses talking right so this

213
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:59,490
ETFs which is the next process

214
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:02,190
television covering so idea of

215
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:06,870
copy-on-write is that instead of

216
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:09,450
replacing replacing the block what it

217
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:13,410
does is it copies the block in turn in

218
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:15,570
that copy it changes the ads the writing

219
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:19,500
it overrides it instead of over

220
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:22,980
overwrite in that block and say the

221
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:26,040
power goes out or you have restrictive

222
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:29,900
right and stuff like that it makes it so

223
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,900
you never have to FSE it

224
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:44,530
go ahead just set here so basically it

225
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:53,140
is either written or it isn't to make it

226
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:55,390
set and then if the disses if it just

227
00:13:53,140 --> 00:14:00,699
crashes and ski the written or it isn't

228
00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:03,160
and it isn't I think to change okay so

229
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:05,850
next thing I want covered here is the

230
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:11,850
black cleaners so normally they have

231
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:15,010
four white blocks DFS uses 120 and

232
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:16,690
minimizes the fragmentation another

233
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:22,110
interesting thing about the block is

234
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:27,850
it's just like when it's written and 250

235
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:34,450
15-6 sha checksum is in the black as

236
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:37,560
well there and then they're three copies

237
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:40,470
of data let's see here

238
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,748
so this is the block here so you have

239
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:45,089
the first copy date here and this is the

240
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:49,759
metadata and and the cool white metadata

241
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:54,860
so like I said before like if you look

242
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:54,860
here that would be the black

243
00:14:57,089 --> 00:14:59,719
so

244
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,530
and even got the check something at the

245
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:08,130
bottom here and where it was written

246
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,130
right here

247
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:16,350
okay so thanks Marcus little bit easier

248
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:18,930
please the different attributes

249
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:21,600
CFX once you get it installed recompile

250
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:24,979
it and stuff and running have it you

251
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,390
assigning a PDF it gets very very

252
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,520
straightforward so these are the

253
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:32,819
different attributes that you can apply

254
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:34,920
sure so you can make multiple copies so

255
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:37,710
that one habit is corrupted you can

256
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:41,459
rebuild it another copy you can turn off

257
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:44,610
all in the execution of that assignment

258
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:47,370
so you're like I want I want to sign

259
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,680
this folder execution rights or not

260
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:54,410
execution right to do that and create

261
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:58,439
overlays be scan it is the buyers can

262
00:15:54,410 --> 00:16:03,530
give this like PSD itself and then

263
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,530
extend the attributes and then zone

264
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:17,010
depression folders or disks and then

265
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:19,770
contacts which is like SV Linux so you

266
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:25,050
can define users group oldest types

267
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:28,230
stuff like that then you can do limit

268
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:30,660
the amount of space that is older in

269
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:37,470
half or you can turn it to read

270
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:39,030
read-only and then give the different

271
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:43,620
caches here I will be covering that

272
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:46,800
caches and raids of in blogs once we

273
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:48,270
cover this just is that covering away

274
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,719
too much its have enough time to

275
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:56,689
describe all that stuff here and then

276
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:59,010
you have different ecl's so POSIX ACLs

277
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:00,180
and then the different kinds of

278
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:06,900
checksums

279
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:10,619
you can use here 256 is really all you

280
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:14,880
need you can go up to 512 though we just

281
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:19,169
cracked nothing I guess this is just for

282
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:21,920
disks but 256

283
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,920
there by 12

284
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:28,720
all right so these are the different

285
00:17:25,898 --> 00:17:33,070
options so this is tab time completion

286
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:36,730
you can see with clinics I'm using air

287
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:40,119
thanks by the way is interested so this

288
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:42,159
is calculation like CFS yet and these

289
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:45,459
are the different options that you can

290
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:49,269
choose from to get it so I want to get

291
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:52,049
attributes of any of these options and

292
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:52,049
then

293
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:59,240
that so then you go to see if I step and

294
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:01,520
it really is dissonant once you install

295
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,740
it and he was trying to be dead and

296
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:09,730
stuff like that

297
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:14,419
ZFS is incredibly famous all right so

298
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:17,030
see if s it like I said designed to be

299
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:26,000
brain center so the first thing you have

300
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:28,280
to do with CFS two important zpool

301
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,929
import so you know two different

302
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:36,309
interfaces just he'll be death and then

303
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:40,580
the effects which deals with the actual

304
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:42,620
partition really is the pool is

305
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:49,220
important export that's really all you

306
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:52,340
need to know all right so this is where

307
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:58,760
hatcheries it's pretty self-explanatory

308
00:18:52,340 --> 00:19:01,939
if you have like the amount used if they

309
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:05,690
might used you have a nice Els

310
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:09,110
whether it's parented its own is its own

311
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:13,220
that have extended attributes the number

312
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:16,040
of copies here there's two copies is it

313
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:19,550
check some kind of checksum is it is it

314
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:21,230
compressed and read only and there's a

315
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:25,060
lot of different options but then just

316
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:30,680
kind of summarize three different ways

317
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:33,830
CSS features and attributes so now we're

318
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:37,430
going to see the CSS command so where

319
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:43,520
were asking that partition like

320
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:46,100
different attributes so get get it send

321
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:50,300
the attribute property is the value on

322
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:52,100
or off the source is inherited or is it

323
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:54,350
is inherited or not

324
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:56,770
so is it handed down you know like a

325
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,770
subdirectory

326
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,670
okay so like I said it's pretty

327
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:11,640
subsequent turn either get the attribute

328
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:17,230
of an end you can say so I need the pool

329
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:20,320
cool - then you have the folder so I am

330
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:23,440
asking about this attributes and

331
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:26,919
attribute off on this folder of this

332
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:29,799
point so in here I'm getting that

333
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:32,830
attribute and I just said get attribute

334
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:38,740
of every four so these are the inner

335
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:44,620
quarters folders less property value and

336
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:49,179
whether it's negative or so the key a

337
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:58,120
compression is a compression off what

338
00:20:49,179 --> 00:21:01,360
kind of impression is it whether whether

339
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:05,709
the folders iSchool executable or not so

340
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,299
I used scripts because you know cool

341
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:10,570
things we give up sometimes without

342
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:12,070
going actually going through the code

343
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:15,309
and stuff like that so you want to turn

344
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:24,639
it secure office and you pull something

345
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:27,430
it's so so now read-only so some

346
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,820
explanatory you said

347
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:36,830
pretty simple set the read-only property

348
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:42,770
to this worthless like that's what this

349
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:47,720
is like that so that it's a UID

350
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:50,810
so basically when this do you have users

351
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:53,660
groups and others you don't want the set

352
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:56,690
UID bit set because then people from the

353
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:59,660
you know internet access that data so

354
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:01,730
you want to turn off the state UI bit

355
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:06,020
cuz then that's just a security

356
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:13,800
precaution whether its own like I said

357
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:17,879
this is BSD term you get the checksums

358
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:21,350
check some value so what kind of checks

359
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:28,340
were using I just use sha-256

360
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:33,439
as just a standard the amount of copies

361
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:33,439
here second she got used for that

362
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:44,100
you got a piece can see their value on

363
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:44,100
that folder

364
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:54,678
communication notification there's a

365
00:22:52,639 --> 00:23:01,039
trade-off for communication it's better

366
00:22:54,679 --> 00:23:02,210
to use copies than even rotation so

367
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:06,519
these are the different commands the

368
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:06,519
list of all the commands that are used

369
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:20,100
they didn't have any questions on the

370
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:22,080
festive party before because what you're

371
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:27,990
doing you would use 50 cent impression

372
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:30,030
for instance when you see the terms of

373
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:32,610
like I had a little bit like large long

374
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:36,360
writing there's there's a really good

375
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:37,770
blog give us good later in the tool when

376
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:46,770
I don't even do it

377
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:53,090
II do occasionally found just wasn't my

378
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:56,400
default it's a

379
00:23:53,090 --> 00:24:09,449
23:23 firelock and it goes really

380
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:11,850
independent of that okay so and as you

381
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:14,520
can see at the bottom feature house

382
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:16,699
notes I never a really good chichi with

383
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,700
that

384
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:22,820
so different features

385
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:38,168
you guys can see that this is from the

386
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:41,559
feature EFS site okay so are most

387
00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:44,799
interesting with btrfs is that it

388
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:51,879
generates check sums to both the data

389
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:54,700
and the metadata plus fault isolation so

390
00:24:51,879 --> 00:25:00,009
metadata is stored separately from user

391
00:24:54,700 --> 00:25:02,669
data Hopkins right talking right would

392
00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:02,669
be Travis

393
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:16,840
all right so mkfs main file system so

394
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:20,440
that's the command there to make file

395
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:23,860
system see the data it's a single each

396
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:28,590
FS also the same is designed for frames

397
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:32,290
so I'm defining here that I steal twice

398
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:34,090
today as soon as well what I want to

399
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:39,129
name the label so I'm just gonna name it

400
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:41,830
each ifs and and EV SEC is the physical

401
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:47,920
device to me that they don't want and

402
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:49,480
that's the output so the chair fences

403
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,330
kind of living in the features when you

404
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:55,240
can read that's a ZFS that's just so

405
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:58,409
many features so you have compression

406
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,410
you make it read only

407
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:09,790
they also sub items you make this is

408
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:11,979
feature of us great sub I am and and

409
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:17,230
that's the name the sublime amount of

410
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:20,200
creative outlet and I'm saying lists all

411
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:23,700
the files in this directory and that's

412
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:25,990
the supply in there created that folder

413
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:32,040
alright so now we're making a snapshot

414
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:38,890
of sub line or so that's the inner so

415
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:42,810
snapshot cooler and instead of creating

416
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:42,810
some white and then

417
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:50,970
now I'm creating a read-only snapshot at

418
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,419
this hole here

419
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:55,729
and that's the full

420
00:26:53,419 --> 00:27:02,389
that I'm making the snapshot of their

421
00:26:55,729 --> 00:27:04,959
living here my steps - are is the syntax

422
00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:10,639
for me going

423
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:13,399
so is the usage of that feature fast

424
00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:17,779
like I said this is a single disk you

425
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:22,699
got besides an allegation racial stuff

426
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:27,009
like this alright so just up another

427
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:27,009
kind of usage at commander

428
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:40,280
and another one yes it's just the usage

429
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:42,860
itself it's more statistics 4070 about

430
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:46,120
that used as you can see they're single

431
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:46,120
discs rated

432
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:52,320
all right so now we're gonna be covering

433
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:54,330
what I think is the most interesting

434
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:58,620
aspect to feature that's what effect you

435
00:27:54,330 --> 00:28:01,259
can double supervise you print the

436
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:09,268
superblock information a little

437
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:12,629
different statistics copies array there

438
00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:15,600
I'm dumping it and when you dump it you

439
00:28:12,629 --> 00:28:18,658
can use and I'm going to this next

440
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:22,529
feature it does check and just like this

441
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:29,090
is the tubes block that I want to use so

442
00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:29,090
you can back it up and breathe out

443
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:34,169
so

444
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:39,000
they're in the different superwatch

445
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:42,950
areas

446
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,950
the BG FX use this

447
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:48,759
sighs and the last one there is the

448
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:54,129
command we use to copy the superblock

449
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:54,129
so but you would put two clocks in node

450
00:28:56,049 --> 00:29:03,529
all right here we're dumping the treats

451
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:07,070
I'm just kind of different attributes

452
00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:10,340
but weed is it's more interesting than

453
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:15,559
yet raised it's just a single season

454
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:21,369
twice and so Duncan tree charts tree

455
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:21,369
structures in stem and High Street

456
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:26,339
inconsistencies

457
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:26,339
[Music]

458
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:37,489
so here you're playing sighs this is the

459
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,489
tree

460
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:47,170
here we will show it listing a property

461
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:48,790
and here you're mounting it with

462
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:53,850
progression Elsie Hill

463
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:56,409
so that's Mount and it was just defined

464
00:29:53,850 --> 00:30:00,810
different properties when you're

465
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:00,810
mounting it that device

466
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:11,470
that's the hold about that it's this

467
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:14,470
thing that's about this I'm here really

468
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:17,350
with Linux but devices are stored in the

469
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:19,120
Deaf directory and they start as big as

470
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:25,709
DB s DC's

471
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:30,580
used us the third year I'm creating the

472
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:34,059
feature FS directory directory and and

473
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:37,840
so then once this finishes run this

474
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:42,928
command mounting and here I'm backing up

475
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,928
to two folders and an account listing

476
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:52,830
all right now give different checks the

477
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:57,439
feature F s CK is a different identity

478
00:30:52,830 --> 00:31:02,780
created for specifically for checking

479
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,780
that I'm saying progress

480
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:11,850
so these are the different things that

481
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:11,850
it checks when you run that feature

482
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:28,399
all right so this is repairing this and

483
00:31:23,469 --> 00:31:33,399
again find the super product so if you

484
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:33,399
like bad just fighting it there

485
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:41,240
restorative

486
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:43,010
extinguish my hand posted that XFS yep

487
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:49,940
does anyone have been questions about

488
00:31:43,010 --> 00:32:00,440
the GFS before you go to XMS okay so my

489
00:31:49,940 --> 00:32:04,550
team that expense yeah she is type cases

490
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:07,720
of STP said to me before this and then

491
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:12,050
the directory that I'm mounting a

492
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:16,900
directory called Mount / 6 FS and then

493
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:16,899
I'm going to mount that it's read read

494
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:23,209
and in the second place

495
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:29,289
second-most unmounting it so it's kind

496
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:39,150
of like a joke with a joke with Linux is

497
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:42,220
you mouth they leave out that okay so

498
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:46,270
listen think interesting thing about

499
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:49,150
exercise is that you can't go back to

500
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:52,779
the medic so you can back it up

501
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:54,669
which meditate up and use like a 500

502
00:32:52,779 --> 00:32:58,600
gigabyte disk when I backed up the

503
00:32:54,669 --> 00:33:00,909
metadata is about 300 megabytes so you

504
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,340
can pack them to metadata and it becomes

505
00:33:00,909 --> 00:33:08,260
corrupt you can restore the metadata and

506
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:12,520
fixes difference so so that's dumb fire

507
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:17,408
so I'm backing it up to file called XFS

508
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:22,330
backup at home my name's bad drivers

509
00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:27,940
that's the file trading and then this is

510
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:30,610
the directory I used to do mouth so Zulu

511
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:34,260
mouth analysis at this location so

512
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:34,260
that's going to be different

513
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:55,460
but that's the monetary but the second

514
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:59,159
part of that so and just labeled we

515
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:03,240
better go through the facts of all

516
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:05,940
Medicaid at the bottom then this is

517
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:09,418
semester school so I'm gonna restore the

518
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:11,880
metadata this can feel crunch here I'm

519
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:14,549
defining I wanted to be covered for

520
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:20,159
posting this group trace is the most

521
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:23,000
verbose option and I'm gonna be using

522
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,000
that file

523
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:29,668
I'm using restored

524
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:41,800
all right so now on to tools is kind of

525
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,800
extra time graphic left

526
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:51,479
50 minutes l5 power

527
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:54,899
let's go cover smart CTL show you like

528
00:34:51,480 --> 00:35:00,000
smart days we did HD farm will show a

529
00:34:54,899 --> 00:35:04,470
lot like features and disks without a

530
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:08,070
driver all of that so I recently read a

531
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:10,049
forensics book where sky found there's

532
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:12,390
two different ways they can do this but

533
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:15,570
hardware manufacturers are actually

534
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:19,160
creating a hidden partition firmware and

535
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:23,730
they are backing up metadata to that so

536
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:26,370
very small amount of data is being saved

537
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:29,820
and actually transmitting head back to

538
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:32,640
you manufactured so they can collect you

539
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:35,340
with a tena so HD farm will show those

540
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:38,609
features and so it's a very very

541
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:43,590
in-depth thing you can bring up a device

542
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:45,810
to but kind of he said read all the hd5

543
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:48,200
a sheet app is gonna show to the

544
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,200
temperature

545
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:57,480
he's always kind of like let me see

546
00:35:51,930 --> 00:36:03,710
listing disks interesting teacher what

547
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:07,140
acceptance is you do backed up MBR and

548
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:08,450
replace it you scruffy actually write

549
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:16,558
over it or something like that

550
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:19,980
that's why CJ all right so this is

551
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:25,730
command line version of smarts PTO so

552
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:30,690
first one here - is all features and

553
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:32,940
prepping so this is uh you're finding

554
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:38,369
this dream your mother supporting some

555
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:40,170
asking is it available and is it in able

556
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:43,069
to purchase it so we've currently

557
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:46,950
disabled at this point year and then

558
00:36:43,069 --> 00:36:49,200
secondly here I'm saying - s is smarter

559
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:53,160
supporters so I'm saying turn that

560
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:56,149
feature on for the first days so SDA is

561
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,149
going to be the very first is

562
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:08,730
you see at the very bottom all right so

563
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:11,100
this is smart about our CTL X all just

564
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:16,910
going to show all the different smart

565
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:22,770
features so you have serial number yeah

566
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:25,440
well WN is forever file systems so disks

567
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:29,759
are going to be allocated device ideas

568
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:34,020
forward fighting each other with s

569
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:41,100
companies so now every prices version

570
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:42,570
disabilities exercises vacation etc so

571
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:47,880
this is the graphical version of smart

572
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:52,290
EQ so it really is the exact same thing

573
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:55,130
except for its beauty so you see here

574
00:37:52,290 --> 00:38:01,160
the exact same thing

575
00:37:55,130 --> 00:38:08,170
what that was saying so you can say see

576
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:08,170
if we report there so this is our output

577
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:22,210
all right easy fire there is a lot of

578
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:26,930
very refined information page design so

579
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:38,089
first things that can just come up or

580
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:40,190
work logical well and 4096 so I'm gonna

581
00:38:38,089 --> 00:38:44,720
go through three different pages that

582
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:47,359
it's going to turn out here coming up

583
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:51,348
here you have enabled different options

584
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:55,210
that hard drive is gonna support and

585
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:55,210
it's enabled start actually

586
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,100
so these are more options

587
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:06,900
the harder I supports or doesn't

588
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:16,660
and freeze your hard drive set passwords

589
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,660
to America

590
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,790
[Music]

591
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:30,560
and evil and you don't

592
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:30,560
for network file system then apply

593
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:38,970
all right so the farm here

594
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:49,100
all right so you can do this with lock

595
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:55,060
tab as well

596
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:55,060
easy farm that particular place is

597
00:39:56,050 --> 00:40:05,390
usually they says it's sta-1 XP - but SD

598
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:10,359
card started with that that game is so

599
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:10,359
here asking it's read-only

600
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:25,598
so I think the SD card beautiful name

601
00:40:23,259 --> 00:40:28,750
all right so these four different

602
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,750
mounting options

603
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:50,350
you just see tail and - I so we can also

604
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:50,350
name it myself low so

605
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:55,359
this file

606
00:40:56,850 --> 00:41:03,839
move it so making that virtual instance

607
00:41:07,099 --> 00:41:15,530
is another GUI like it's very

608
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:25,569
it forces things very well do you know

609
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:27,940
they like versus no only mouth and stuff

610
00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:32,440
like that they don't have a very

611
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:33,789
forceful where's like Mounties through

612
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:50,760
super user

613
00:41:33,789 --> 00:41:58,049
you know that is h d farm so here as a

614
00:41:50,760 --> 00:42:05,279
it's the temperature of this and that is

615
00:41:58,049 --> 00:42:08,279
you can also turn the to do unit equals

616
00:42:05,279 --> 00:42:08,279
death

617
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:17,109
as disks on listing the disks so this

618
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:21,570
das first test and different partitions

619
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:21,570
here secretary

620
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,790
I

621
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:36,850
so you know so this was an encrypted LVM

622
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:38,509
so

623
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:43,690
Elvia was going to three different

624
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:43,690
partitions so actually like it

625
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:55,910
into outer the business there and swap

626
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,910
partitions swap wall

627
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:00,359
here

628
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:06,050
in two different ways so the SIS is a

629
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:09,710
sub-directory original subdirectory

630
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:13,060
block SDA is the first disc with

631
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:13,060
physical block times

632
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:20,750
and here using octave you're saying get

633
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:23,740
physical block size of

634
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:23,740
yeah

635
00:43:30,279 --> 00:43:37,559
I was hoping just another listing of

636
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:37,558
devices or discs

637
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:43,040
and the topology of the disk

638
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:51,630
alright and then the last thing I'll

639
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:53,840
cover here is fixing discs when they

640
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:59,100
become corrupt

641
00:43:53,840 --> 00:44:01,460
basically just okay usually that would

642
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,460
be at

643
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,010
that's what through

644
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:17,970
all right so again I might do a part two

645
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:17,970
I can fight beside yet

646
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:22,800
all right any questions

647
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:30,160
and get in that video tutorials at

648
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:32,490
YouTube

649
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:36,240
archive and bitch you just find

650
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:36,240
America's XP

651
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,159
[Applause]
