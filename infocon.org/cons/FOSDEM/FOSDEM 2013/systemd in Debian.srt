1
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,640
at yet let

2
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:41,640
think we did take here

3
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:56,880
as lynn

4
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,530
lol and welcome

5
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,060
everybody an I'm power for him Michael

6
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,080
the I've been a bit better and of

7
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,660
since 2001 and Michna

8
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,670
Michael and I are here today to talk
about says Indian

9
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,649
yen both the the current state little
bit but system itself

10
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,450
an our plans for desi and

11
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,799
a bit on how see the integration arm all

12
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,069
system the in Debian a special also

13
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:35,290
in relation to two other in its systems

14
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,590
the the idea is

15
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:45,590
be

16
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:42,039
officers probably mostly what you want
as rather persistent the file

17
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:45,930
and the really cool thing here is still
have already said

18
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:51,689
from as the system 5 in scripts are just
another corporation source for system

19
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:52,120
the

20
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,529
a.m. it Parsis the others be header

21
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:59,419
and from I mean I'm going to show it
quickly later on

22
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:04,330
a.m. what you can do his you can declare
dependencies between all of them

23
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,508
so I mean there are other systems which
a

24
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:11,289
treats a.m. system 5 it as a completely
different

25
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:14,430
on separate from the owner in its system

26
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,879
and bacall thing here is that you can
mix and match

27
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,349
and what is also means for devin is that
weekend

28
00:05:21,349 --> 00:05:24,650
later on we can talk about that you can
actually

29
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,739
replace packages one by one it doesn't
matter in which

30
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,250
order that this is happening because the
dependences will still work

31
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,550
so

32
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,289
him cindy has certain units types unit
is

33
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:41,979
a.m. the Center Configuration source
assistant system the

34
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:45,878
its any based any style base and

35
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:49,939
and we have seen an example earlier so
and

36
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:53,080
their is equally II try to group them

37
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,669
their basic a 66 hype so which you need
to be aware of

38
00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:01,089
there's the target which we already
mentioned a target is compare a bill to

39
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:02,979
a two-run level insisting 5 in it

40
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:07,139
arm one of the differences is that
multiple targets can be

41
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:10,939
active at the same time and for example

42
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:15,270
the multi-use a target is compare a bill
to our rc2

43
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,219
or are 22 25 which were using Debian

44
00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:22,990
I a service is the central description
of

45
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,449
a phone actual service that you want to
have started a

46
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:29,779
socket is the special unit file

47
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:33,710
which is needed for services with which
provides Activision real

48
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,109
go into detail later on Manzo to mount
and

49
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,229
and swap units um they're basically

50
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:43,859
most most of the time into love in for
system team

51
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,069
system D parses it a TFS top and
generates

52
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:52,339
units for for the defied devices and a
random on pines and

53
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:56,099
and usually don't have to write a.m.
monde units

54
00:06:56,099 --> 00:07:00,519
so you can do that and you can mix and
match them

55
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:04,389
but most of the time you just keep on
using fessed up and

56
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:09,389
just be happy with it so that their
party units in time units

57
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:13,349
time a base activation is something a
which will become more interesting in

58
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:13,990
the future

59
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:17,039
at the moment I don't think it's really
irrelevant for deviant

60
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,190
so what we're most interested in for

61
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,959
you should be interested in are targets
those in sockets

62
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:29,879
up that's for the quick introduction up
for about system team

63
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:32,919
now I want to talk about the current
state in easier little bit

64
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:37,019
so it's based on version for it and I
already heard

65
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:40,180
about many from many people who his
tests at all

66
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,719
Debian as usual outdated what many
people don't know

67
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:49,039
is that system the and you def or
actually a lot of people do know that

68
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,740
there were merged they were

69
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,060
lot of rumors members a.m. but

70
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,719
to ally and at them the version numbers
a.m.

71
00:07:57,719 --> 00:08:01,469
we skipped 139 for you this I think so

72
00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:05,099
what we are we are currently fortune
releases behind I think it's hard for

73
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:06,409
your something like that

74
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:10,009
yeah I think it's a pretty solid release
was mostly missing in

75
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:13,279
in inversion forty-four is but the
journal is not s

76
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,620
powerful and capable arm butts

77
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,800
but we were as we're freezing of a year
ago

78
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,019
we did that before the the youth system
the merger so

79
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:27,839
that's why we choose that or what that's
why we ended up with that question

80
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,299
so what we

81
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:35,859
chieftain in in we seem and we're going
to show the later is that

82
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,729
basically our RCS around level I don't
know how how many people have you know

83
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,039
also the basics

84
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,510
a.m. workings of a deviant system 5

85
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,680
in it based system where we have the RCS
runlevel

86
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,899
which is basically for setting up the
initial system where you

87
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:56,189
Mom 2 star fair bring up the network and
stuff like that

88
00:08:56,189 --> 00:08:59,279
and we most weepy

89
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,630
basically got get rid of that you can
actually

90
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,959
Deepika's force uninstalled in its gets
package and

91
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:09,589
to some people still booed this is of
course problematic

92
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:14,640
from because in Debian we have so-called
essential flex pretty package with and

93
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,270
happened the other fronts election not
allow you to remove that package

94
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:22,380
with that flake said so what we opted to
foreign status

95
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:27,420
that we blacklist those groups that's a
mechanism by system the way we can just

96
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,339
some link the service to death knell

97
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:35,069
and that means for system to you that
but the church's should ignore that

98
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:35,800
service

99
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,059
so even if the on the line in its good
is

100
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:43,309
system 5% inode based we can something
to eat a definite all in a in and

101
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:46,360
configuration directive from uncertainty
and

102
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,209
to not assistant

103
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:55,279
and some we do have about 1200

104
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,360
season 5 in strips and Devin which is a
lot from

105
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,380
but we don't actually have to care about

106
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:06,439
ok all of them from the start if you
want to have the biggest impact

107
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,790
restarts converting the most important
ones and

108
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,029
we do have that for example you to Ft
bus

109
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:17,350
are syslog so I mean there's the term
plumbing layer

110
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,390
which has been kinda since a few years
a.m.

111
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,670
we do actually have quite good coverage
in in that area we have about

112
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:28,229
16 sixty packages which are already
converted

113
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,279
and for a typical best of installation
it's a

114
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,300
it do not actually have that many other
spaces in five innings troops left

115
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,569
which are still running AST some but

116
00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:42,050
but the basic in it basic system

117
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,660
is brought up by system

118
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,219
so what do you when we

119
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,839
package to stem the we split up in
different pictures

120
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:57,779
there's a.m. for made for me by the
pictures besides a few library pictures

121
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:02,449
it's the system the package then there's

122
00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:07,209
fairly fairly simple and basic UI for it
which you can use that system the

123
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:11,219
agree their system the units last season
5

124
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,630
um which is nothing more than just a
bunch of symlinks

125
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,890
no which replace for example s been

126
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:21,529
les aspin's less in its with a sibling
to to

127
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:24,730
been system the um since that

128
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:28,149
self I conflict with the system five in
a package

129
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:32,020
a and 65 in its the suspect in a package
again

130
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:36,189
has that problem that it's an essential
package a.m.

131
00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:41,099
decides to move all those a.m. although
some links into a separate package so

132
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,329
you can actually install system D
without

133
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:48,160
having a conflict by triggered by the
package manager

134
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,490
and least there's slip 'em system team

135
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,689
which basically hooks into a lot Indian

136
00:11:54,689 --> 00:11:58,550
which is service which tracks locking
users

137
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:02,149
its basically successor of console kid

138
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:05,160
and what list early prime system D

139
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,270
the does is richest reduces the session
for use when you do

140
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:14,140
Larkin and usually you want to do that
if you have a a desktop system

141
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,939
where you want to have ACLs applied for
you audio devices

142
00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:22,649
videotape and stuff like that I mean
their deck and a corner cases where a.m.

143
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:26,540
you wouldn't want to do that on a server
may be a restricted server

144
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,529
but you should I I mean we've seen that
a lot people who

145
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:33,850
this Avery comments know who didn't have
all the time system the

146
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,929
installed well same usually should do
that

147
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:42,250
um

148
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,709
brand when you're starting a system five
minutes grid

149
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:49,768
events brought up during the system this
in osage

150
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,929
finish initialisation sorry a

151
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:55,980
is that it the actually let's get this
started by this

152
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,189
system the um but when you later on

153
00:12:59,189 --> 00:13:02,490
during the run time of this system when
you're running at CNET

154
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,579
arses look start stop restart something
like that

155
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:09,209
um you we will kill the process

156
00:13:09,209 --> 00:13:13,049
but system you will just notice that
that it's been killed in mark this the

157
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:14,289
service has failed

158
00:13:14,289 --> 00:13:17,679
what you actually wanted that in that
place is that you a

159
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:21,720
sent to start stop restart request
assistant Ian system you will do that

160
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,120
restarting for you

161
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,799
so what we applied is well a bit of the
heck I'd say

162
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:32,370
we are not the proud of it but but it's
it's working exceptionally well I think

163
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:37,069
so there are quite a few almost the
netscape system five-minute scripts and

164
00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:37,719
Davion

165
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,059
used a lesbian and functions I'm

166
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:44,179
as that thereof 1200 packages

167
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:48,110
and about 900 of them use those LSP

168
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:51,839
in the functions and we used that

169
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:57,120
that when it soars to use that to
redirect to start stop restart calls

170
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,220
and ever to system D that also means

171
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,839
if you're installing a packet package
a.m.

172
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,959
and the postman tennis courts run a
invoke RC D

173
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,409
and stuff like that it's also indirectly
redirect a

174
00:14:10,409 --> 00:14:13,569
and for that it's working pretty well
but

175
00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:17,280
we want to address that later make the
better

176
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,299
a as a set a split of the

177
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:23,579
the XO siblings the conflicting files
out of its been

178
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:26,699
two different packets system D can be
installed along San

179
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,719
alongside sis for cypionate without

180
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,169
any conflicts um you can still have that
a safety net installed

181
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:37,480
I am all you need to do is to change
your you

182
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,720
boot Kaman would per litre just at in
its

183
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,659
a people's been assistant dean to your
command line

184
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:48,039
and then you'll just fire up and start
system to you will take over from there

185
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:52,150
though we do not do actually

186
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:55,909
change the system in any way which would
make it impossible to go back to system

187
00:14:55,909 --> 00:14:57,079
5 if you

188
00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:01,209
decide to do so

189
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:04,559
so I just wanted to show you did that
the current state

190
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:11,559
of the system a of integration

191
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:23,560
so what we have here is basically I'm
stock installation of

192
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,550
even with the its threatening the the
contest

193
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,639
actually works with Realty income show

194
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,079
folk sign in set: Sopot

195
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,008
do people you mean with a microphone
working

196
00:15:38,009 --> 00:15:45,009
all what I'm going to do is

197
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,000
at those d

198
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:05,849
triggers as

199
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:08,889
to seeing all the time system please
install the medical

200
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:12,329
it sorry comments so it should be
brought in

201
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:15,540
I still hurts five minutes

202
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:22,540
polluted I can take a look

203
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,420
I'm apps

204
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:33,420
sorry you

205
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:39,910
maybe missed

206
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:46,529
so at the moment

207
00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:50,510
what you have to do is you have to
change your configuration

208
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:55,130
to steal food to system I'll do that and
you

209
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:58,670
love it probably the easiest ways to

210
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:02,279
just take that into your to default grew
up configuration

211
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:09,279
and sewn up

212
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,409
now what it did I forgot to remove the
quiet

213
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:21,339
parameter so her persistent insists
there's a

214
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:24,760
a.m. what system the that serious

215
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,510
a.m. its takes the the quiet parameter
with

216
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,710
which is usually used by the kernel
messages

217
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,880
and applies the to its own configuration

218
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,169
you can override that their this isn't
the main page

219
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:42,059
I'll like system the a lock level

220
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:47,440
you can for you you can change it back
and and

221
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,340
things that yet contented you can change
those settings both

222
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,370
on that come come online as well as and
the configuration file

223
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:58,959
old him up

224
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,200
would have guessed

225
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,620
I'm

226
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,678
too bad that with them

227
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,840
called fun

228
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,168
I and it actually worked

229
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:24,169
it actually worked

230
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,420
so systems yell is your

231
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,890
come on with with which you are going to
matts

232
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:46,590
most your services so what you're seeing
here

233
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:50,110
device units a.m. or what about

234
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:57,110
Harbor and right

235
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,260
and a.m. you're going to see here

236
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,260
those are all that if there is their mom
paw

237
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,350
mount units pass than here

238
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,860
services this once %uh the Alice B
services

239
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:19,250
here we do have a native one have any

240
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,540
I mean there's there's there's lots of
stir crazy stuff

241
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:27,850
there which we can between down um
basically if you scroll down you'll see

242
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,959
we do still to have a couple of a
lesbian it's getting there

243
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,679
but ices look

244
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:37,740
per ticket to a big deal

245
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:42,669
that he was a committed services origin
native Nick

246
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:46,710
or other expert pretty well so um

247
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,970
that come into our system CTL that's
basically used

248
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:54,429
terms for for starting stopping you
services

249
00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:58,010
in a services by default are

250
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:01,629
this disabled and you need to enable
them explicitly

251
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,970
from and you can do that with the

252
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:08,640
enable commander disable combine from
system City OH

253
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,179
basically everything I wanted

254
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:19,179
should up

255
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,490
so but but there's still some problems

256
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,610
in the current state of Weezy um

257
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:33,139
in service has a very special way of
defining an

258
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:37,480
system facilities these are a bunch of
facilities

259
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,550
a.m. which are you should

260
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:44,310
actually be declared in this system 5
LSB head of the system by thin strip

261
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:44,909
itself

262
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,160
but too but in surf polls that out and
and has a

263
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,780
at sea in serve con but the directory
wait to Claire's them

264
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:55,550
so it's not used by a lot of lot of

265
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:58,780
us in five minutes ago but if you for
example park map

266
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:02,480
declares among declares a system

267
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,640
facility and you to that a.m.

268
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,270
and if s mounting is currently in not
working I mean

269
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:13,440
we are probably going to address that
since Jesse by

270
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,780
by adding in surprising support with you
have patches for that

271
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,170
um I'm almost like we're just going to

272
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:23,830
to convert a as common in part map to
use

273
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:27,429
suck activation so this problem will
just go away because we don't need those

274
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:31,110
explicit dependency anymore and tallest

275
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:35,459
prison mentioned at the beginning a most
of the time if their problems

276
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,480
with with services inconsistently

277
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,850
its it's because they're better return
and

278
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:45,770
I mean be honest most of us just

279
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:49,370
just copy existing system five minutes
groups do some

280
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:52,929
changing of the past and that's about it
nobody actually understands what he's

281
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:53,860
doing in there

282
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:57,459
so could at least we have the impression
that

283
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,530
most people do that and what we've seen

284
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:04,790
I mean we have around to 1200 in its
group and added a crab Cove

285
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:09,560
over those files ended it were about
1,100 sleeps in their

286
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,570
my I mean that's terrible this is
terrible and

287
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:16,939
one thing that's that's causing problems
for us that people actually don't use

288
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:20,090
a.m. the existing mechanisms to reliably
stop a service

289
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:23,230
start stop the man has something like
that the retry option

290
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:26,770
which waits until the deming process
stopped

291
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:30,310
or at least that the PAD four that
process is long longer

292
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:33,678
running a what what many people do use
that just

293
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,880
killed the six kill the process at
asleep I mean you do

294
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,590
three second five seconds whatever
depends on a faster machine was

295
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:45,889
value developed a ok well you've written
the system five instead

296
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:49,200
and this is this is causing problems for
us for System z

297
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,320
because this to be just a just stop
command and doesn't wait for that

298
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,240
um restart is another problem

299
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,330
whereas in five in spurts do something
between stop and

300
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:05,260
inside and Justin the the asian sex a
lot

301
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:09,660
logic doesn't actually have a restart
kamande in inside so

302
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:13,360
it translates into an in stop requesting
such requests

303
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,760
and so if you do more in in in the
resort action

304
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,270
that's actually something assistant he
will not execute I mean there are a few

305
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,429
a couple

306
00:23:22,429 --> 00:23:25,630
system fashion spreads not that much we
we

307
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:29,350
first fault that we kits at a workaround
to assist in the butt

308
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:32,580
in the end we decided it's probably just
better to get the

309
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,928
thin strip steaks dance we think it's
the right way to do

310
00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:40,090
yet

311
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:44,060
so Anna Jesse the next release

312
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:49,720
the we probably going to be using system
5 in at

313
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,850
on most systems an wat the

314
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,909
obvious at their so in

315
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:01,910
the next income 38 I think they're going
to start depending on system D which it

316
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:02,550
will go

317
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:05,820
cause all kinds out interesting they
want I'm sure

318
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,730
said by default will I I think we're
likely to see system five-minute

319
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:16,560
still the default the to cindy is
obviously going to be supported

320
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:21,178
and if we can move to a single in its
system for desi

321
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:24,400
that would make me very happy but I
think I don't think that's going to fly

322
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,230
politically

323
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,940
am because I name this is

324
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:33,280
this is its as much political question
as a technical question I think

325
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,570
I'm yep

326
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:39,720
the the source trees

327
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,830
for system D and you don't have notched
we're going to keep you down

328
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:47,629
in its own separate binary package say
if you

329
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,630
12 keep system be out to your system you
can

330
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:55,470
at least for the time being do that part

331
00:24:55,470 --> 00:25:00,570
yep yep from dollars as going to take
over from here because

332
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:03,780
I'm also part of the county and I mean

333
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:07,379
p we are quite a few people in Dec 19
and

334
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,230
we talk about what to do it with canola
3.8

335
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:14,679
where more about components are going to
rely on system the

336
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,410
there's inhibit stuff Apollo Management
there's a look in the

337
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:21,730
the already mentioned look in the which
replaces console kit any

338
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:25,370
it's getting a more and more complicated
for us we simply do not have the

339
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,330
resources

340
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:29,960
to to keep the console key to life so

341
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,660
we basically the SOP that for Jesse we
are going to

342
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,720
fully switched to lock in the a which
means

343
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,760
I'll we will will no longer use
complicates on on our Linux

344
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,110
based systems what exactly means

345
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:49,479
for non-existence about K-fifty you see
we actually don't know yet

346
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,990
I mean in maybe it's possible to to

347
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:57,740
to just disable this kind of
functionality income settings the man's

348
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:01,310
and still works we don't know

349
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:05,040
the thing is we have more or less

350
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,470
know that we do not have actually many
or if

351
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:12,490
any economic uses on on K free speech
KCBS The

352
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:15,490
and we spend a lot of time up

353
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:19,880
a fight I'm to just get the architecture
compiling running

354
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:25,510
and without any actually users which
test and run this stuff so

355
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:30,240
I mean it will probably happen that some
of our packages will be timely X any

356
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,870
an account take I guess that's that's
what we're going to see

357
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:38,020
um what it actually means for for
installation of

358
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,429
new systems is that we probably get
going to provide

359
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:45,010
a a crop snippet which the

360
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:48,970
techno all met up packages can depend on
so your system is such a mess

361
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:53,290
automatically setup to boot into system
D so we don't have to act the command

362
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:53,610
line

363
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:57,149
the boot command line a

364
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:00,340
I don't know if it's possible to two to
pet depend on systems

365
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:04,649
let celeste is five because that will
conflict with this is the final package

366
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:08,040
and we want up want to let people at

367
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,889
keep this option to switch back to
assist in five innings if they tooks

368
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:14,910
so deserves a more of a safety net than
we actually

369
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:18,929
encourage that but I mean if people are
given

370
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:22,080
the opportunity to explore the new
system

371
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,290
I mean it's fairly new new come ons it
works different

372
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:28,379
the complete different mental model and
in many ways

373
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,500
and we thought it's probably a good idea
to to give people

374
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:37,230
at least for you really cycle the option
to switch back to assist in five minutes

375
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:41,110
so support temporal

376
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:44,409
yep and we're going to make it easier to
package

377
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:48,800
up a system the support and and all to
make some oh the

378
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,990
tools that we that are in the bay system

379
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:55,590
the more where up system certainty

380
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:59,250
so friends and services local city
update our city

381
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:03,330
right pat says to make sure that they
will actually do the right thing

382
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:06,428
and Aaron actually already patches we
just have to get them

383
00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:09,720
yet with actually get a much I so for
instance

384
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,630
if you disable a service for n in one in
that system

385
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:17,530
it should also be disabled it in the
other one

386
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:21,810
the because you know it's a bit silly if
you

387
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:24,899
disable it I players who disagree with
that I mean it

388
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:31,900
hit the morning

389
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:42,950
okay yet

390
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,480
that the case well we blacklist the
services

391
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,179
from and in its good package that in
that case we won't actually use

392
00:28:59,179 --> 00:29:02,659
update our city to do that we will just
likely deathbed

393
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:05,880
in away which is specific to system D
said

394
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,890
yep don't know absolutely not I mean
like

395
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:12,090
if you then boot into into it is a
5-minute

396
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:16,730
obviously that like then it's great stat
it depends on children just like

397
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,059
when you when you boot system system day
we use

398
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:24,620
that the native services we have for
doing the same thing I am

399
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:29,939
there's also last year there was a
Google Summer of Code Project I

400
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:34,270
which was system D units to assist in
five minutes cryptic letter

401
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:38,020
it needs a bit of fixing and brushing up
and stuff but

402
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:41,149
thats also something want to investigate
because

403
00:29:41,149 --> 00:29:45,580
us us use of writing service description
for system it's really simple

404
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,879
and with could just generate then it
scripts

405
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,370
that would hopefully both make pick a
free beasty

406
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:57,510
people happy because they can keep their
its grip and it would hopefully also

407
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,440
lead to high quality and its grips

408
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,270
if people were to when people are

409
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:06,360
keep using system 5 it I

410
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,949
it's not going to be a solution for all
all of the different

411
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:13,679
the scripts but if we can light

412
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:19,179
for that EC normal demons man's to do
that that's also going to make it much

413
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:20,190
easier to

414
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:25,149
not diverge between at scripts and
system days service descriptions

415
00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:29,260
because let me just jump in here for a
second

416
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:33,299
that system d2 system five in a
conversion is mainly interesting

417
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:37,600
I think in the future I mean that we
already have those system 5 in scripts

418
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,158
written

419
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,820
and I won't go away overnight so a.m.
it's not like

420
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:45,260
supporting system the in Debian means we
are cutting off

421
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,889
K street use the or other ports just
means that

422
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:53,000
you want to support system the you're
going to its those files in the future

423
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,700
and maybe maybe in the future when you
don't want to write system 5 in skirts

424
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,200
anymore

425
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,610
it just use that option we provide and

426
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:05,199
we can still keep support for for those
parts and if it's not possible

427
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,000
to do that with that than it could be
that you still

428
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,460
you have to rights to files which can be
a pain for us

429
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,620
for some a so people but

430
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:21,539
as you've seen they're pretty simple
source file so

431
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:24,658
should much yep

432
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:29,139
and as as Michael already mentioned we
can because we have the

433
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:32,729
because this than five minutes is its
greats our first class

434
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:36,730
citizens we can actually change pact is
one by one

435
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:39,980
weekend we can start shipping if you are

436
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:43,039
if you used have a package in the middle
of a dependency chain

437
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,720
you can start shipping service falls
today

438
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,840
well went essay opens without score
having to coordinate and

439
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,918
with that packages which you depend on

440
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:59,179
and the packages that depend on you
that's pretty a pretty neat

441
00:31:59,179 --> 00:32:05,980
yeah yes

442
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:10,870
yeah know that maybe it maybe it's about
term talking about converting

443
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:14,428
its adding support for the S&P at
updating is a better word which is on

444
00:32:14,429 --> 00:32:15,149
the site so

445
00:32:15,149 --> 00:32:18,459
yet not I mean unless you yeah

446
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,960
that you don't want to drop the it's
just a 5-minute spurt yet unless

447
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,860
for some reason you really don't run
with just a 5-minute which you probably

448
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,490
do today

449
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:32,070
yeah at source

450
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:36,689
yeah suan a/c we are really pretty late
on time so I'm

451
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:43,690
at ok well question sir

452
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:59,409
I think that would be a good idea

453
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:03,480
at the moment for I at least for Jesse
should I repeat the question

454
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:08,020
yeah okay sorry at the question was if I
as a package maintainer 12 at

455
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:11,629
system to support to my package but but
they can't be bothered to write a

456
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:14,670
system five minutes get should it just
depends on the system keeping its

457
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:18,050
and I think you shouldn't do that at the
moment at least for chessie

458
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:21,870
I mean as we sat woo we give

459
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:25,040
we have to give people at least one
really cycle to

460
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,570
time to get used to it too did new
system and

461
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:31,970
maybe we can we can circumvent the
problem by

462
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:36,270
by providing such insistently 2005 in a
converter so you don't have to do that

463
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:43,270
I mean for civil cases the church's work
right

464
00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:50,450
right it that's exactly what system

465
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:57,450
that's that's a different topic and and
that's what we are going

466
00:33:57,809 --> 00:34:02,459
we r going have to do in all-male but 40
for

467
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:09,458
demon although

468
00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:25,169
up still at it I mean YouTube you can
actually know if with them on issues in

469
00:34:25,168 --> 00:34:25,868
the context of

470
00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:28,970
only or if it outside of town

471
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:32,219
so I don't actually think there aren't
that many system 5

472
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:36,009
in his crate sweet which are affected by
or are

473
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:39,889
our index known steak let's put it that
way okay

474
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:43,019
so S et al

475
00:34:43,018 --> 00:34:46,189
out just go to skip over that pretty
quickly so

476
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:49,510
because be running out of time I think
we eleven-hour

477
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:52,659
so unit files are simple declares text
files

478
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:56,399
um that one is important this point
because

479
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:01,140
from I think it's been talk about that
on Debian developer for a while

480
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,799
her some time ago is this over at
mechanism

481
00:35:04,799 --> 00:35:08,599
a which issues more and more in pictures
a.m.

482
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:12,059
and the idea here is that you ship the

483
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:16,039
a the package ships it's it's
configurations or sites default file

484
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:19,720
under lip or use a lip and

485
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,910
if you have to dynamically change it by
by some kind of

486
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:27,078
dynamic mechanism you put that

487
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:30,809
in in flesh run and otherwise with a

488
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:34,789
a an administrator has to override a
unify the service follow our

489
00:35:34,789 --> 00:35:38,150
anything he puts it in at at sea and
there's

490
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:42,380
corresponding director spectacle put
that let me repeat that: packages

491
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:45,440
should put it on their lips and he's
system and

492
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,779
for

493
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:52,369
so there's actually a configuration
package conflict a

494
00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:55,779
file it's called in the system the

495
00:35:55,779 --> 00:36:00,519
a.m. battery pack it we didn't bother
splitting off into the system to use

496
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:01,758
less stuff packets

497
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:04,809
its its kinda pointless because install

498
00:36:04,809 --> 00:36:08,210
like bill depending on system date sir
it all adult

499
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:11,509
install system they on that Billy but it
would actually make

500
00:36:11,509 --> 00:36:14,769
any like it won't make it won't change
the basis that I'm

501
00:36:14,769 --> 00:36:17,799
so its its actually harmless to install
suspect the

502
00:36:17,799 --> 00:36:21,750
on on a system and it doesn't change
anything on the seepage

503
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:25,859
and tell it to use it the question has
come up a few times and we just said I'm

504
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:30,500
what tiny a text file package config
file we want to do that

505
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:37,500
0 added to a sip okay

506
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:43,640
okay

507
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:50,640
and

508
00:36:54,549 --> 00:36:58,710
how higher going to talk call the
package I'm and separate ballot Pickton

509
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:05,710
to up

510
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:27,450
I H yeah okay what I completely forgot
to say at that letter is here

511
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:30,779
the other sister he was an kind enough
to show up

512
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:35,220
can do have applause yep

513
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:40,750
some

514
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:44,200
the different service types I guess I'll
just go there prickly

515
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,350
their own their own mainly 5

516
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:51,450
important once five months and important
ones are forking

517
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:55,230
the bus may be simple the other once one
shot is

518
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:58,690
usual used if you have a a script

519
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:02,410
which has executes system 5 it was a
good example

520
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:05,700
x11 common which just set up a few files
but

521
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,220
but doesn't start and the long-running
service a that's the one you want to use

522
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,089
for a one-shot

523
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:13,500
simplicity fault it's for non-smoking
dance

524
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:18,990
the bus a type specifies

525
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:23,629
a arm by your signal system the way not
been a process has

526
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:26,820
DeMint has started and it's ready to
accept requests that means

527
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:30,590
dependencies which depend on it are
started

528
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:34,170
so you can grab it up name under under
System

529
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:37,880
bus and if that happens system the you
will

530
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,140
continue studying dependent services and
that's what

531
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:44,370
type the buses for a you specify the bus
name

532
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:47,750
and if that's taken the service is
considered up

533
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:51,270
a forking means that the diamond

534
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:54,910
it's a classic system 5 them on

535
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:58,410
if you specify a pit file it will look
into that

536
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:03,390
and usually in in the olden times a when
the pitfall has been written it was the

537
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,200
signal that the them in

538
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,680
was up and ready to surf requests not if
I some things just

539
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,140
specific and need special support by the
by the

540
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,910
but actual them into signal I'm ready
please continue

541
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:20,230
a I think that just a handful

542
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:25,100
I only know ever hit demand which uses
to notify other more do this okay

543
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:30,490
def right but but outside assistant DA

544
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:33,859
doing low lot of services okay

545
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:38,500
one thing you should know is that SP
system five types of services

546
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:42,100
a are using type parking remain off the
exit shoe a

547
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,900
that means I'll to for example

548
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:50,570
0 get sorted out much

549
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:54,120
okay so okay I coated detail you

550
00:39:54,120 --> 00:40:00,009
up

551
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:02,960
just like me all one thing which mobile

552
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,490
I wanted to stress is that assistant to
unify said the different type of

553
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:11,049
so these activations I mean currently
insists just in five in it

554
00:40:11,049 --> 00:40:14,079
we have a basically

555
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,089
the you to assist in a the bus

556
00:40:17,089 --> 00:40:21,160
the man which which starts services on
the month we have people

557
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,740
running stuff and you have rules long
running processes

558
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:30,019
a with you in it in its completely
separated and and and system 5 in it

559
00:40:30,019 --> 00:40:32,169
doesn't know about all this had two
sources

560
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:35,559
Justin the poses altogether and provides
those

561
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:40,410
different types of activations on let's
go over there times

562
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:43,990
she would just skip to completion okay

563
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:47,459
skip over it I guess if you know if
you're interested

564
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,559
I'm we're going to put this light on
line

565
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:53,910
so the I think we'll base will just have
to skip it that way

566
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:58,049
we kinda did and

567
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,089
yes %uh day

568
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:02,619
maybe no time at all those

569
00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:06,320
if you are going to right system

570
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,560
5 in its group are you have system in
streets in your package

571
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,490
you can't do that today to better
support system 5 assistant the

572
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:16,859
and its but basically already what what
we mentioned a.m.

573
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:19,880
avoids start/stop on a Reese

574
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,119
doing special election and restart I am

575
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,609
we do have a a a kind of the heck
consistently where we parse the

576
00:41:28,609 --> 00:41:31,690
the help of put so we know is that
demonstrate parts reload many

577
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:34,930
do get that wrong they payday this

578
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:38,450
dement supports reload even if it
doesn't so

579
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:41,750
try to to avoid doing that a

580
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:44,829
if it's possible don't use
enable/disable flex

581
00:41:44,829 --> 00:41:50,230
you are and and if if possible don't use
any other team in specific config files

582
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:50,750
at all

583
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:56,260
a if for example if in any case you have
two tests

584
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:59,640
because you have to study specific codes
Union

585
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:03,549
but in a spirit or something L just use
that tests and shell

586
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:07,440
going to keep

587
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,150
okay yet

588
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:14,440
so the completion I am

589
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,859
Cantlay don't at like well

590
00:42:17,859 --> 00:42:20,950
word and Miller phrase it's kinda hard
at not I

591
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:24,879
but wat and tell Tess is open and we
actually have some or all

592
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,230
I'll that policy and all that bad in
place because

593
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:33,440
if you start doing too much before than
the you're going to have to do extra

594
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:40,440
work

595
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:43,410
it's better to actually not adds that
extra support

596
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:48,569
than have it broke and surprisingly talk
to us

597
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:52,330
I were on were on IRC

598
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:56,790
we also have email addresses so wheels
are here

599
00:42:56,790 --> 00:43:01,670
so just grab us if you have any
questions we would really like feedback

600
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:05,010
week like I mean it works for me Anna

601
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:09,050
but and it works for Michael that we
don't actually have that much feedback

602
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:09,840
from people

603
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,750
on whether a death works well for people
whether what kind of problems you're

604
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:14,680
running into both

605
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:17,790
in in the system the package itself but
also

606
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:22,150
ass packagers what kind of like do you
like

607
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:26,770
what extra tools you need and

608
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:30,980
yeah don't be afraid we're not that
scary okay

609
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:35,540
so we don't have any time for any
questions or is 10

610
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:39,700
okay I'm sorry %uh so if you're
interested

611
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,120
a and and you see I've questions grab
outside side

612
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,150
yep

613
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:51,730
sir yep

614
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:55,020
at these a moment in time I dunno the

615
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:58,610
strongest part ate their system the or
