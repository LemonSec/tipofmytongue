1
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:06,588
cell

2
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:09,670
I'm then next keynotes and

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,679
is about politics

4
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,870
an and in particular free software

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,140
campaigning the Euro what can be done at
the European level and so forth

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,949
am the speaker is Amelia

7
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:30,949
and his daughter

8
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:35,690
so

9
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:41,120
hello i guess its not morning anymore
but good morning to love you anyway just

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,449
me

11
00:00:41,449 --> 00:00:44,500
late-night yesterday and I just waking
up

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,129
my name is Emily on the then a.m.

13
00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:52,799
I'm here to speak to the concern active
in the European Parliament

14
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,620
I'm not a lawyer by training and I
dedicate myself primarily to

15
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,250
policy right and I followed free
software and policy companies offer for

16
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,479
quite some time

17
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,229
and it is in fact one of the main
reasons that I became politically

18
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:08,539
involved in the first place

19
00:01:08,539 --> 00:01:11,710
soon the institution in which I bernard

20
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:16,339
is my love three institutions that make
legally binding decisions and European

21
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,240
what do we mean by legally binding well
soon rewrite laws

22
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,369
in the later hopefully applied to the
people and public authorities and the

23
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:25,110
company's

24
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,569
that are active in the European Union
the other two institutions are the

25
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:30,569
European Commission

26
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:34,310
which is what we call like an executive
body when

27
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:38,330
be in the parliament have made alarm the
European Commission try to ascertain

28
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,520
that the loss

29
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,910
made are actually implemented correctly
in all the member states and forced

30
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:49,098
be also the single right initiative I'm
proposing legislation

31
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:52,780
so this means that when we in the
parliament

32
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,550
right the law actually don't write from
scratch

33
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:01,140
and it's more like for analyzing and
proposing changes to the proposal that

34
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:01,929
was made by

35
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:06,170
European Commission am so we have a
phone institutional to the Council of

36
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,340
Ministers and this is just an
international organization

37
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,060
operated by governments different Member
States they also develop a general

38
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,489
policy

39
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:18,700
nights European Commission so whenever
the Commission makes a proposal for a

40
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,109
lot

41
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,739
it's not like they just rather than in a
room there accord

42
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:27,560
they also actually have some kind of
general political direction

43
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,379
within which they can make his proposals
and becomes the ministers

44
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:35,690
operate through negotiations between
ministers that come from the member

45
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,459
state governments normally have some
difficulty getting along because we know

46
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:40,880
the 27 member states

47
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,760
so this is a lot of different wheels in
different directions that have to be

48
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,769
concerned

49
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:48,030
am but essentially they can do the same
thing that we do in the European

50
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,000
Parliament which is

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,080
look at the text proposed by the
European Commission say

52
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,920
we don't like this word we don't want
the actual documentation we want them to

53
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,540
the appropriate documentation

54
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,739
or maybe they won't be. adequate
documentation something like this and

55
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,290
they propose these amendments

56
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,540
we call them and then afterwards the
Parliament and the council had to agree

57
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,100
on the different proposals that they
pass on these texts

58
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:16,470
and am that is a very long and arduous
process because often been a completely

59
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,620
different objections to the Commission's
proposals

60
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,430
but I was hoping to get to suck in this
general business as the EU works

61
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,770
talk soon I will move on it's just kinda

62
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:30,040
important new good generally
institutional framework in which we have

63
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,450
to him

64
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:35,299
during which I have to work soon the
first thing that is interesting to look

65
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,590
at result recorders

66
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,130
if of course if they aren't all affected
by European the cancellation

67
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:44,250
am and they are in various ways and I'm
sure that you will be noticed and

68
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,200
probably many are you even dedicated

69
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,470
time into thinking about how your
affected by European legislation

70
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,849
but when a movie is the previous
editions oppose them is that when I

71
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:55,040
follow the legal tract

72
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,069
it's often include reserve recorders
which particular legislation they are

73
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:00,849
affected by

74
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:04,609
or even like which particular
jurisdiction they are affected by

75
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:09,180
so we have some am general lost that
will normally costs a lot of

76
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,489
obsessiveness and rage

77
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:14,680
like the patent laws which are generally
a mess not only for the soccer field but

78
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,019
also for every other team

79
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,030
am or in general so like

80
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:23,359
copyright or licensing schemes and maybe
public procurement rules

81
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,410
but in the European developer
communities in very extensive debates on

82
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,910
on american legislation and the problems
caused by americanization

83
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,009
so sometimes get these emails from
people who've seen

84
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:39,250
maybe a lawsuit somewhere in the United
States they're very agitated with this

85
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,740
because the zone that had to be paid for
somebody infringing on a patent that was

86
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,610
clearly bizarre

87
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:47,370
is very large and than is actually not a
relevant

88
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,410
forward European software developer

89
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,910
similarly if you get an infringement
claim which doesn't really have

90
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,300
like you'd infringed on this patent
please stop

91
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,180
doing that and the only thing that you
have is basically a paper that sees that

92
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,130
and it doesn't say which particular
patent

93
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,480
brainstorm and doesn't say who sent you
this claim

94
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,750
or whenever like that I mean it doesn't
make sense to be really

95
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,190
upset with this to me and so

96
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,570
this is something that so that is
something that I wanted

97
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:20,070
like me because I would European
legislation soon

98
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,900
whatever happens in the US ICS really
not my field

99
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,330
and if you're planning to develop
software in new European Union

100
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,359
probably you should not care about the
legislation either because it doesn't

101
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,570
really apply to you if you're in

102
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,690
in Europe or at least you could claim it
wasn't I

103
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:40,650
see you am some

104
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:45,120
I have to organize my papers

105
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,229
am soon

106
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:51,760
of course before I'm mention European

107
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,659
laws that affect me something I have to
quickly jump back into procedural

108
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,889
again and I apologize for that so the
European me

109
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:02,620
European Union makes loss and the
related normally be implemented in the

110
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,020
Member States

111
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,030
am and in the Member States imports
which

112
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,460
interprets the loss made by the Member
States in that Member State

113
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,840
so when we make European law this is a
bit like fuzzy and often it's not

114
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,650
directly applied

115
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:20,560
I am and very often there is also a
great disparity between how the laws are

116
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,410
implemented

117
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,590
and actually upheld in the member states
and this is partially

118
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,869
European Commission to ensure these some
type

119
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,810
regularity in this rumored am

120
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:36,240
soon the bridge on prime primarily no
and follow our political discussions at

121
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:36,979
the European

122
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:41,659
Union level and that exist in Brussels

123
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,500
am and they're sometimes very far away
from what would be the practical

124
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,699
implementation of these laws in the
Member States

125
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:53,490
so I mention this is a safeguard notes
to help be held to account to believe do

126
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,630
if I make a description of the allergy
that

127
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:59,449
seems to us. if it's not close to what
you are familiar with

128
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:03,800
it's probably because I know but we have
been thinking about the Brussels

129
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,199
and then somebody at the member state
level has been pondering what our

130
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,639
intentions could be and just completely
misunderstood our general directions

131
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,050
am the different laws that applied to
software in Europe would include

132
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:15,889
copyright laws

133
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:19,800
patent laws public procurement rules
which define how the public sector makes

134
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,699
purchases

135
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:25,910
to some extent at least when we have the
by general industrial policy of course

136
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,400
how we encourage the development of
standards in the European Union

137
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,380
and also actually projects that we try
to facilitate between the Member States

138
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,449
through research or government programs
am

139
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:42,259
I can also add some company on which is
party

140
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:46,039
governed although actually at the
European level we have eight or nine

141
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:49,740
company directives that determinism
common rules for how you make a startup

142
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,500
or how you run a company in various
numbers dates but they're actually

143
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,520
there's actually still a lot of
differences so if you're planning to be

144
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,460
an entrepreneur

145
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,430
in the European Union looking at the
European because the freemen normally

146
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,669
isn't going to do you much good

147
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:07,219
you need to be aware of the conditions
in your particular member state

148
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,539
soon if I start with copyright law and
happened mom

149
00:08:10,539 --> 00:08:13,949
it sometimes convenient to talk about
with these negative remarks at the same

150
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:14,639
time

151
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,340
because the shares some similarities
particularly in the enforcement

152
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:23,599
also the problem faced policy-wise are
largely the same

153
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,009
the political discussions are they
remodeled with enforcement havoc

154
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:31,400
and a relatively small amount to very
large industrial actors

155
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,568
are benefiting from public instituted
market monopolies

156
00:08:35,568 --> 00:08:40,189
and are at least partially making life
different difficult for everyone else

157
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,300
it's also a legally complicated feel
since am

158
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:46,579
everything one deals with when talking
about these issues

159
00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:50,149
is basically abstract so if you're going
to

160
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:54,940
consider like a patent or a copyright
how would you tax the value of the

161
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,220
copyright for instance

162
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,269
the city even have a value who decides
what valued house

163
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:03,350
and at what point after its conception
does it have a value

164
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,120
if you write to be schooled today
clearly that could become valuable in

165
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,040
like six months

166
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,430
or a year to somebody even to many
people but

167
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:15,680
how would you kinda packs that that
value that would actually be kinda the

168
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,270
problem

169
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:19,689
if you're dealing with the cancellation
word even running

170
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,720
company around this am psalm

171
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,620
in Europe we have special copyright law
for software

172
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,850
software called therefore isn't actually
covered by copyright

173
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:34,890
as such its covered by are you repeal
law which is based on the copyright law

174
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:38,230
and dependent on the copyright law
existing but the past some special

175
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,750
provisions which apply

176
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,550
will need to code in my country which is

177
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,819
freedom the software copyright directive
is

178
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,180
incorporated in the general copyright
law but there's a special code which

179
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:50,949
again

180
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:55,390
only applies to some record sewn one
difference is that by default software

181
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,430
called which is returning

182
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,579
biannual you in the course of your
employment will always fall on the

183
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,610
employer

184
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,589
normally you would expect this to be
regulated in the contract between the

185
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:08,570
employer and the employee

186
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:12,290
and soon again night

187
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,800
for an example from my country
journalists always get the copyright for

188
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,979
the texts at the written

189
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,910
and in Sweden the journalists gets to
keep the copyright for their

190
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:25,029
for their texts waves winces in germany
you will have difficulty finding

191
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:30,399
publisher who doesn't see that if you
are a journalist in my employment

192
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,140
any texted you right to the copyright
will fall to me but this is then

193
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,170
this is statutory with some so you
cannot be an employee

194
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,519
in the European Union as far as I
understand and write code

195
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,550
and have it dick the software still fall
to you

196
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:47,719
on this you did the code in your free
time

197
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,529
am also home of course for software
programmers the reality is that often

198
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:55,630
you will have this clause in your
employment contract anyway

199
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:59,380
because it's very calm common for
especially larger companies stand

200
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,720
but apply for many patents or trademarks

201
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,160
that normally those companies would not
want their program is to have unnatural

202
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:07,540
kind

203
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,010
right to to stop back

204
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:14,970
am and therefore in the employment
contract will see that

205
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:20,050
any immaterial rights or intangible
assets that are derived from your

206
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,329
employment

207
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:27,050
will automatically fall to us the
employer

208
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:30,380
soon one of the things that is important
to understand about Europe and European

209
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,200
Union is also that we have these 27 sent
to the 28 member states

210
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,980
that have their own legal systems and
their own courts and this means that

211
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,810
something like

212
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:42,849
a software license like GPL for instance
would have to be tried in on those

213
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,540
member states

214
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,250
before they can actually be be valid and
this is like part of the general

215
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:48,930
copyright

216
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:53,040
more like general contract freemen that
in order for contacted about Bali like

217
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,180
between employer and employee you're so

218
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,439
it has to be declared valid by court
because this is the safeguard mechanisms

219
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,279
we have

220
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,709
in our systems just as I'm

221
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:06,560
soon license is basically a contract
between the rights holder

222
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,660
and reveries making claims on that which
is contracted licensing has become an

223
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,010
extremely common way of creating value
in society and according

224
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:18,060
to me is likely arbitrary way of
creating value since it's the only thing

225
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,750
you're doing is basically establishing
that some transaction we look Irvine

226
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,700
somebody

227
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,740
does something we do think that is
normally anyway easily possible for them

228
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,620
to do in pretty

229
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,880
cooking movies are mp3's would be a
perfect example

230
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,490
am up something which is extremely cheap
and easy to do

231
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:39,240
but that we're trying to put into this
transaction rembert but it's also very

232
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,860
different debates

233
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,970
talk about this too much am contracts
and licenses phone

234
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:48,120
under the dome they exist because we
recognize them

235
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,130
be assumed that they're valid and the
courts nation-state cement interview

236
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,230
went to contact the party's

237
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:57,910
have disputes over what the contract
with the license actually requires those

238
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,550
parties to do

239
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,599
so I'm the courts

240
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,769
will solve all the conflicts but only
for their particular jurisdiction

241
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:10,380
and the jurisdiction is normally just a
member state

242
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,829
some through European legislation we try
to make the results of these conflict

243
00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:16,930
resolution mechanisms

244
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,640
to not be and try highly arbitrary
between the Member States but

245
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,890
with things that have very detailed
provisions like for instance a GPL

246
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,470
license or even a Creative Commons

247
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:30,279
license it can sometimes be very
difficult

248
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:34,390
to tell but not all parts of the license
apply in all jurisdictions

249
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:38,079
the European Union you could for
instance imagine that if in one member

250
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,959
states the licenses are completely
upheld in the contract is seen as

251
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,279
completely valid

252
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,189
in the different member states the
courts will beam that according to our

253
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,440
legislation

254
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,110
which has been implemented if different
people only eighty percent

255
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,640
of this license contract actually is
valid I'm

256
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,550
so for the GPO to there was an attempt
to make a harmonized interoperable

257
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,519
license

258
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:01,670
which was guaranteed to be valid in all
the Member States

259
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,750
be interoperable European Public License

260
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,140
was actually work the European
Commission and I think that they deserve

261
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,380
some credit for that

262
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:12,800
and I think that also this is the
problem think that we should want to see

263
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,769
a public institutions doing

264
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:18,720
I'm but the GPO to house also the
feature having been upheld

265
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,680
in many different Member States so even
more me know like how is about

266
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,029
how was it valid where is it valid which
part services

267
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:30,790
and so forth am I'm personally not aware
of any cases where the GPL version 3 has

268
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,459
been tried in European courts

269
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:35,579
but then one in the audience who is
there in such cases could

270
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:39,529
please get in touch with me because I'm
actually very interest in seeing how

271
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:42,750
European courts deal with that home

272
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:47,089
soon other places where one might be
interested in a probability and openness

273
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:50,589
american public institutions other than
licensing and conducting models

274
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:54,070
something record is a core standards
soon

275
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:57,040
the easiest way to make as many people
as possible able to interact with

276
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,769
something relatively complex

277
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:03,829
use to have that complexity complexity
described in some kinda document format

278
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:07,310
which is open and freely available to
people that want to interact

279
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:11,388
and in software birds comparatively easy
and cheap to get started actually trying

280
00:15:11,389 --> 00:15:13,060
to do something

281
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:17,138
and improves the life you or your peers

282
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:20,540
and open freely accessible
specifications are more beneficial than

283
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,790
in other places

284
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:25,219
and the European Union the slaughter
standards normally the commission with

285
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,910
the with the standards and the
parliament will only

286
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,449
kinda intervene when when they set the
framework within which the

287
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:35,490
do these activities and of course many
understand the decision process or for

288
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,060
other parts

289
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,569
industry so there's lower lot of
discussion about open innovation

290
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,610
and talk about taxes the specification
for hardware

291
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:47,430
and other things but different types of
file formats and their various

292
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,699
properties is definitely something that
we bear in mind

293
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,579
am the European institutions themselves
for instance publish

294
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:58,839
always documents in machine readable
formats this is

295
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:03,290
que no well the European Commission has
a cord which obliges them to do that now

296
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:08,430
all EU law in case law entreaties and
many other things are published in HTML

297
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:12,388
from Microsoft bird documents and PDF

298
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:16,160
and that would be like the old Microsoft
Word format because we're just starting

299
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,719
to migrate into

300
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,829
2010 softer now in their previous
editions from 2003

301
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:26,380
some someone you will bondar on so I
make an example of an institution which

302
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,570
publishes document in Microsoft Word

303
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:32,290
but it's actually interesting because
and it's more that there are three

304
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,060
different formats to allow the maximum
amount to

305
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,229
or tournament direction from the
citizens so we have the machine

306
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,540
readability in HTML which is clearly
open and then we also have human

307
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,410
readable which is

308
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:46,490
PDF and that is also clearly open

309
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,790
in the stand the decision procedures we
going to talk a lot

310
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:54,680
in Brussels lately about what we call
fair reasonable and non-discriminatory

311
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,859
licensing terms so this is when a
particular

312
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,079
standard requires the implementation on
something technical

313
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,918
home in order for the standard to be
fulfilled and

314
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,110
that technical thing is covered by a
packed and so you need to be developing

315
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:13,678
licensing model that makes it easy to
acquire

316
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,709
the suitable licenses for those patterns
at a reasonable price

317
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:22,289
so the fair and non-discriminatory
unreasonable basically means

318
00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:25,908
for the totality of patterns that could
potentially be mixed up in this

319
00:17:25,909 --> 00:17:30,769
standard you can get them at the price
which doesn't cure your company or

320
00:17:30,769 --> 00:17:34,059
your activities the technical term for
this is Fran

321
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:37,649
which these fair reasonable and
non-discriminatory

322
00:17:37,649 --> 00:17:41,408
but now from the distance all too many
problems at least or something

323
00:17:41,409 --> 00:17:44,840
programmers and the reason is that the
friend licensed happened ball

324
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,389
typically will still only be available
to everyone the small amount

325
00:17:48,389 --> 00:17:52,600
actors on the market am that may already
be dominant

326
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,350
so it cuts into the opportunities for
developers to make very small companies

327
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:59,399
are launched their products or services
commercial reasons

328
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:03,129
there will be a license area and we are
unable to kind of see the fair

329
00:18:03,129 --> 00:18:04,189
reasonable and

330
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,739
non-discriminatory as being free in
terms of

331
00:18:07,739 --> 00:18:11,429
like free as in free beer in this case I
am

332
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:15,330
so it it will cost money in this is a
barium

333
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:19,699
it was also actually never particularly
obvious to the European Commission the

334
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,590
licensing corporation in terms of round
agreements

335
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:26,830
or patent pools good at all you need 'em
one could imagine that if I

336
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:30,359
big companies have been granted monopoly
rights

337
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:34,779
by a public institution and then the all
join in 1 business than the dissociation

338
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:38,600
to help each other reinforce their
budget position on the particular market

339
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,678
by giving each other discounts on
licenses

340
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,879
I am that would actually be some kinda
cartel which should be which is a breach

341
00:18:45,879 --> 00:18:46,580
of

342
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,570
competition law framework in the
European Union we have a very detailed

343
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,908
framework for dealing with business
standards associations

344
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:57,600
and this type of licensing corporation
in European competition law

345
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,320
am ensures that it doesn't get card last

346
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,960
the reason for this is that the patent
system otherwise would cause

347
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,190
much much more problems than it is
currently doing

348
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:12,369
soon it puts the patent system in a very
interesting night when we

349
00:19:12,369 --> 00:19:15,749
had to create special could special
solutions and deviations in a

350
00:19:15,749 --> 00:19:17,590
competition of rumored

351
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,879
to allow for what should reasonably be
considered a carto

352
00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:24,139
in order for the system not to actively
damage industry

353
00:19:24,139 --> 00:19:27,459
I'm but it's in political problem in

354
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:32,119
in that we really aren't capable of
having

355
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:35,129
any other discussions about this like

356
00:19:35,129 --> 00:19:38,070
politically it's very difficult to move
because there's too many industrial

357
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:41,229
actors impacted by the system and
whenever you trying to

358
00:19:41,229 --> 00:19:44,350
do something about the patent line we've
seen this also last year

359
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,719
the discussions about unitary patent the

360
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,429
again too many directions and you to
never make a compromise which will be

361
00:19:51,429 --> 00:19:53,409
entirely obvious

362
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:57,509
everyone so this is strange

363
00:19:57,509 --> 00:20:01,049
soon home the last two points there are

364
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:04,700
then I can just briefly mention aren't
like public procurement

365
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,909
and this is a bit tricky legal area
because we have many procurement

366
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:08,789
directives

367
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:11,869
in the European Union maybe try to
convince the air how the public

368
00:20:11,869 --> 00:20:14,689
institutions in today's member states
will be

369
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:19,299
making purchases public procurement
essentially is when a public body sees

370
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:23,960
I want to have some service but I don't
want to develop it in-house

371
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,409
some going to contacted in or buy it
from the private active

372
00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:31,419
and because many Member States and
European Union have

373
00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:35,369
be either discriminates geographically
or their problems and corruption

374
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:38,728
we make a lot of Gaza European level to
make sure that

375
00:20:38,729 --> 00:20:42,559
we get cross-border trade in the people
don't discriminate each other basam

376
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,210
geographical origin that kind of thing

377
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:49,549
in the current procurement discussions
that we've had in the European

378
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:50,479
Parliament

379
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:53,599
be were explicitly discussing how to me

380
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:58,109
deviations from the public procurement
rules and your graphical discrimination

381
00:20:58,109 --> 00:21:01,879
if this will spur social order for
environmental purposes

382
00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:07,209
in the IC solutions still we don't have
any we don't have this

383
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:12,489
ambition kinda go towards specifically
open formats

384
00:21:12,489 --> 00:21:16,700
so even if generally we will have on
kinda large political support for that

385
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,070
we don't actually put it in the
legislation so it's not really a reason

386
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,379
to make a deviation from the principle
that a public institution should always

387
00:21:23,379 --> 00:21:24,519
buy them

388
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:28,409
keeping because them buying the cheapest
contractor is seen as the most

389
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:29,499
responsible

390
00:21:29,499 --> 00:21:33,149
citizens money in the European Union
from

391
00:21:33,149 --> 00:21:38,178
also for the e-government services that
I can bring a very briefly

392
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:42,099
these normally big projects launched by
the European Commission to help the

393
00:21:42,099 --> 00:21:43,139
member states

394
00:21:43,139 --> 00:21:46,969
implement some kinda feature that will
make the member states morning dropper

395
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:47,749
bottle so that

396
00:21:47,749 --> 00:21:52,119
if you move from Sweden to Belgium
princeton's you will be able to interact

397
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:55,158
with public institutions in
approximately the same way

398
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:58,879
that you used to do when you were
growing up am and the European

399
00:21:58,879 --> 00:22:01,738
Commission of course concluded that the
best way of making love the member

400
00:22:01,739 --> 00:22:02,619
states implement

401
00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:05,629
these things must actually make them
open sewers

402
00:22:05,629 --> 00:22:09,369
because that we European Commission can
give them away for free and also you can

403
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:09,859
provide

404
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:14,289
the local authorities to genes that
suppress it becomes more convenient for

405
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:15,179
everyone

406
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:19,519
to do with that am and so the European
Commission makes a lot of Cano

407
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:23,059
fluffy proposals like the UN p.m. happen
the unitary patent

408
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:27,009
became from them but to their credit
they have a lot of different units and

409
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:27,759
some of the units

410
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:31,239
lot break and I think the e-government
for instance is

411
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:34,639
one whose institutions soon

412
00:22:34,639 --> 00:22:37,799
one is really difficult with all of the
above topics from the perspective of

413
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:42,580
threesome is tournament free software is
not really a widespread phenomenon

414
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,519
and software programming in particular
definitely is not some

415
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:50,059
the interests in the freezer through
community aren't always congress and

416
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:53,389
also somebody who will develop free
software in their free time

417
00:22:53,389 --> 00:22:57,918
is likely to have very different
requirements on the legislation

418
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,479
the regulatory framework in which from
somebody who is programming a commercial

419
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:04,830
for an exchange targeting business
operations

420
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:08,189
that is they are targeting other
businesses for their products

421
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:12,499
or somebody who is for instance
developing my kid

422
00:23:12,499 --> 00:23:16,769
moose trying to market web browsers to
and consumers alert

423
00:23:16,769 --> 00:23:20,409
for that matter modules to try and take
care of agricultural technologies that

424
00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:21,419
ensure the well-being

425
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:26,879
captor I'm so one thing that I've seen
happening in the policymaking process

426
00:23:26,879 --> 00:23:30,599
though is that and the openness and
freedom means of the infrastructures

427
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:35,129
has a lot of political support and this
is something also that the freezer for

428
00:23:35,129 --> 00:23:38,049
community as far as I've seen often
underestimate

429
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:41,859
I'm political you be home governments
and Leichhardt

430
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:45,549
government representatives and even
ministers the beauty is in the European

431
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,200
Parliament and legislators

432
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,190
not having a problem it on supporting
open standards open source software

433
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:55,429
even free software and deployment of
these in in different localities

434
00:23:55,429 --> 00:23:59,590
soon would be like this actually more
deployment of these tools are you human

435
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,879
existence we have

436
00:24:00,879 --> 00:24:05,840
home suppliers shortage and very often
when people decided that they wanted to

437
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,619
go open

438
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:09,879
they don't have anywhere to turn to
because the dome

439
00:24:09,879 --> 00:24:14,879
they don't have the right number eg so
they don't know actually how

440
00:24:14,879 --> 00:24:18,629
I'm human loss on so it's very difficult
because we

441
00:24:18,629 --> 00:24:22,070
we cannot always will review the results
and what we're doing

442
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:26,599
soon we were discussing the standards
the rectum in 2011 for instance

443
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:29,379
and we did introduce voting on fair
reasonable and non-discriminatory

444
00:24:29,379 --> 00:24:31,080
licensing

445
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,289
and then intervention makes sense if mom
aims to deal with the symptom

446
00:24:35,289 --> 00:24:39,090
and make a particular standard upsetting
circumstance lest severe

447
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:42,488
because the patent system as such

448
00:24:42,489 --> 00:24:45,609
really it's a horrible notes and
political be dealing with this

449
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,779
is next to impossible its there's

450
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:52,159
too many interest groups that the Google
everywhere and

451
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,349
even if it is the cause so many problems
am

452
00:24:55,349 --> 00:24:58,889
its very very difficult to change and
the Tramp licensing

453
00:24:58,889 --> 00:25:04,070
these partially mitigates that also the
brand licensing terms is presented by

454
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:08,729
industry and something that fixes
problems in a very noticeable by and

455
00:25:08,729 --> 00:25:09,830
consumers such as

456
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:14,789
super large contingent shins in in the
Netherlands wins

457
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:20,460
I'm soon and it doesn't deal with the
underlying causes the problem

458
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:24,049
and I think it shows that we have been a
failure in the political system also

459
00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:25,479
because we really kinda

460
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:31,019
lacked direction unable to deal with the
law that obviously causes problems

461
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:35,779
I'm soon the political system in
institutions have a very hard time

462
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:37,919
admitting to themselves also

463
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,090
that there may be problems in a letter
to the freemen the big

464
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:45,009
cannot address from sOooo

465
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:48,269
we get hacks rather than cures and

466
00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:51,639
even when we know perfectly well but
thank you were to the particular problem

467
00:25:51,639 --> 00:25:52,899
we're facing might be

468
00:25:52,899 --> 00:25:56,418
we cannot admit to ourselves that
direction unable to discuss the problem

469
00:25:56,419 --> 00:25:57,609
to begin with

470
00:25:57,609 --> 00:26:00,968
I'm so there's another thing that I've
seen also is that essentially

471
00:26:00,969 --> 00:26:04,419
home well intending proposals and
getting worded wrong

472
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:08,849
this is more like it technically they're
like technology mutual friends is a term

473
00:26:08,849 --> 00:26:09,678
that we use in

474
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,710
public procurement to describe the
procurement process

475
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,269
manner in which no technologies are
discriminated against in

476
00:26:16,269 --> 00:26:20,549
in procurement calls tenders so public
institution would for instance

477
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:25,289
make a tender for I need this small
application for making it more easy for

478
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:29,989
people to apply for the permission to
build a balcony on my house

479
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:33,139
and if that is the collagen neutral
doesn't that kinda mean that you're not

480
00:26:33,139 --> 00:26:34,859
allowed to discriminate between

481
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:38,820
proprietary and free software so even if
you're going to be implemented as

482
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:42,499
software strategy in your municipality
technology

483
00:26:42,499 --> 00:26:45,940
neutrality in that case good can
restrict their options because

484
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:49,549
you have to see all the offers as as
equal so

485
00:26:49,549 --> 00:26:53,179
I'm not sure for instance that I will
always be technology neutral loss

486
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:56,999
in many cases they're good and we want
loss to be generally applicable

487
00:26:56,999 --> 00:27:01,879
I'm but if it's about us making an
investment in infrastructural thing

488
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:04,879
like the software framework local
authority

489
00:27:04,879 --> 00:27:08,309
I we can point to something luxury are
actually basing

490
00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:11,369
that decision at least partially on an
ideological rumored

491
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:15,059
am because in doing so will be also
choosing

492
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:18,479
on which platforms our citizens and
companies

493
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:21,529
and local authorities contract I'm

494
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:25,109
but it turns out when I was discussing
this in in the public sector information

495
00:27:25,109 --> 00:27:26,978
directive that was

496
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:30,179
one when this technology neutrality term
came up

497
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:33,869
am it turns out the actually that
everyone that I was talking to had a

498
00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:36,379
very strong support to open formats

499
00:27:36,379 --> 00:27:39,519
and they wanted normally the public
sector to going to open formats and what

500
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:42,590
they were actually afraid of was more
that the European legislation

501
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:47,590
would force local authorities to adopt
formats that they weren't may not want

502
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,399
or software solutions that the

503
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:53,339
may not be ready to migrate into or
whatever so they were introducing this

504
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:56,049
morning that the peace according to me
would have brought then

505
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:59,749
legal uncertainty for a local authority
in how they can make

506
00:27:59,749 --> 00:28:03,309
strategies for implementing piece of
time

507
00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:08,029
a.m. and with wouldn't want local
authorities to Sony

508
00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:12,580
panic and incur high costs for software
platform migration

509
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:16,468
home but right now we learned in the
parliament that these than expressing a

510
00:28:16,469 --> 00:28:18,419
strong preference for open formats

511
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:22,519
which means that well we would prefer it
if the local authority could investigate

512
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:26,129
ways of thinking the migration costs
nobody will force them to do so and if

513
00:28:26,129 --> 00:28:27,238
the public authorities

514
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:32,580
at the local level Karen the long this
and actually obliged him to do so

515
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,749
am soon in my

516
00:28:35,749 --> 00:28:39,690
opinion because I discovered this time
we had crossed political support also

517
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,629
for the open source solution in the
public sector

518
00:28:42,629 --> 00:28:46,769
I believe that the political fight the
room open source and free software is

519
00:28:46,769 --> 00:28:51,549
more on this one it's good to keep watch
over like the details in the decision

520
00:28:51,549 --> 00:28:52,609
because we still have

521
00:28:52,609 --> 00:28:56,619
words like technology neutral sound
appealing but it may actually cause harm

522
00:28:56,619 --> 00:28:58,299
in some cases

523
00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:01,609
but this is more like you know detailed
worry we don't

524
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:05,519
really need to be afraid of Deputies
openly resisting

525
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:08,839
Open Office of anymore even governments

526
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:12,408
am soon and

527
00:29:12,409 --> 00:29:16,440
this is what if I were a free software
programmer and I was going to get

528
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,899
involved in European legislation making
I would

529
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:21,988
kinda just gently nudge my

530
00:29:21,989 --> 00:29:26,809
politicians into thinking very carefully
about the exact facings

531
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:30,529
or maybe even try to get somebody who's

532
00:29:30,529 --> 00:29:35,379
in Brussels to do that for me because
you do the ideological fight I think

533
00:29:35,379 --> 00:29:38,738
we need now providers and people who
actually start approaching local

534
00:29:38,739 --> 00:29:42,200
authorities to make sure that they have
the software solutions that actually

535
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:42,789
want

536
00:29:42,789 --> 00:29:46,259
am and I would like to and on that note

537
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:49,369
me I think anymore free software
providers that

538
00:29:49,369 --> 00:29:53,999
target public authorities and European
Union need to be making connections with

539
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:57,499
local authorities in particular knows a
government institutions

540
00:29:57,499 --> 00:30:00,779
so that there is actually something for
these institutions to procure

541
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:04,710
because at least when I've been talking
to people in the European institutions

542
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:05,849
even when I meet people

543
00:30:05,849 --> 00:30:10,908
local authorities am even when this
would be submitted

544
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:14,169
soon thank you for allowing me to come

545
00:30:14,169 --> 00:30:17,659
and I hope sufficient optimistic

546
00:30:17,659 --> 00:30:24,659
if you have any questions you can
approach me

547
00:30:31,889 --> 00:30:34,289
so design want to ask your question now

548
00:30:34,289 --> 00:30:41,289
yet

549
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:54,679
hello and I think most of the people
here tonight in favor of open source

550
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:55,460
software

551
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:59,280
but we've just seen another attack on
open sold by Microsoft

552
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,649
where laptops that have been designed

553
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:06,040
for Windows aid have locked down

554
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,490
EFI so that you can no longer good

555
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:14,210
in alternative operating systems I see
there was a question

556
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:18,450
Austin the parliament about that have
there been any answers yet

557
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:21,559
send interesting question actually yes

558
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:24,730
I receive the question in my Inbox the
answer to that question in my

559
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:28,540
yesterday and the Commission's is that
they haven't seen any competitive

560
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:32,059
distortions arising from the UEFI secure
boot

561
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:39,059
yet but that they're monitoring the
situation would you like that

562
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,928
good their monitoring the situation soon
but the on-scene unfortunate

563
00:31:45,929 --> 00:31:49,530
has been transmitted to me in Swedish my
native language should be published in

564
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:50,928
the European Parliament website

565
00:31:50,929 --> 00:31:54,970
sometime soon and it answers those
concerns at the same time so they make

566
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,770
no distinction between the competitive

567
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:59,990
in like didn't make a distinction
between freedom

568
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:03,100
consumer which I suggest be regulated
under

569
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:07,459
consumer protection laws and freedom
developers which I would say is

570
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:11,400
regulated on competition Fremont but
answerable to the mint ones and say that

571
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,250
they have seen

572
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:16,890
competitive distortions arise from the
implementation of this system

573
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:21,330
yet an a.m. we didn't look at it too
carefully

574
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:25,760
yet maybe we can ask followup question
but at least

575
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,929
day been made aware that there is a case
for it and the only thing I can see

576
00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:32,049
myself going on on this line is long

577
00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:36,040
like okay the consumer protection law--
stan is there a consumer protection law

578
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,799
that sees

579
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:41,090
that a consumer cannot be Hannah when
they buy the hardware that can be forced

580
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:41,709
into

581
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:46,770
picking a solution which is found this
way but that would also can oblige me to

582
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:51,168
prove that a consumer can actually be
actively disadvantaged by the system

583
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:54,610
and because the consumer I think
normally be be getting

584
00:32:54,610 --> 00:33:01,610
I'm not sure that that would be the case
it but it's kinda like an interesting

585
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:02,550
mix

586
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:06,760
various topics if you want to talk more
about the

587
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:13,760
me

588
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:30,530
am very pleased you talked quite a bit
about fair reasonable and

589
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,090
non-discriminatory licensing

590
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:36,480
from terms and is the European Union
going to do anything about

591
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,510
industrial standards that are mandated

592
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:43,320
to industry where the agent license
holder

593
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:48,000
refuses its front obligations
specifically based on the fact

594
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,050
that the software is open source I'm not
sure that I understood

595
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:57,950
so there are certain meeting holders
that see that your

596
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:01,830
trying to get paid license for full

597
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:06,449
with the use of open source software and
as a result of that because it

598
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:09,889
in facts you know because the fact it's
open source

599
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:14,040
signal was your request it very similar
to the way

600
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,150
this or the mobile phone industry
companies have been doing it

601
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:21,139
but that's on a much larger scale where

602
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:24,799
you know it where the front pages just
either refused or

603
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,830
they can we all requests where is the
front system should at least

604
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:30,860
some cases of the dialogue was absorbed
ago she Asian

605
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:34,780
those available ago but it's about from
licensing

606
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,220
and when a friend licenses refused yes
on

607
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:42,239
on on on technical standards that are
mandated by the European Union's

608
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:47,069
demanded yes well the Commission working
group on this

609
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:50,429
but because I work in the European
Parliament we wooden

610
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:55,840
a we decided the framework in which the
European Commission

611
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:00,360
been set up working group to address
these issues and

612
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,670
as far as I know we've made a free
market where in which the Commission has

613
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,830
the option of making teaching

614
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:10,610
and i've seen the PD and the prize
organizes workshops on these topics

615
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:15,000
where the invite large stakeholders
including from the open source community

616
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,490
soon am but night

617
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:23,339
it the European Parliament these I would
assume is not the right institution to

618
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,610
be dealing with this problem

619
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:28,550
because we cannot really change much in
that

620
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:32,970
the European Commission tries and I know
that in the industrial policy that was

621
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:37,410
recently released by the European
Commission be explicitly complain about

622
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:42,069
happened gets and happened Wilson what
do you do with standards

623
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:45,410
and transparency like it's almost
impossible to find out

624
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:50,049
who owns all of these victims and I
think that in the industrial policy this

625
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:53,300
is really becoming such a severe problem
now that we need to win

626
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:57,360
introduce some kind of transparency
requirement USM

627
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,680
US company need to be starting to keep
like

628
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,850
files which happens you think that you
actually own

629
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:07,940
Pacific Standard specific industrial
areas

630
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:11,980
breeding and that but you're being in
the European Parliament it's been very

631
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,350
very difficult to get

632
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:17,670
this paper burning new European
Parliament can sometimes the

633
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:22,600
slightly decisive when it comes to very
concrete

634
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,870
topic sleigh whether or not we won't
appropriate documentation

635
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:31,759
or just documentation something like
this but when it comes to

636
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,660
questioning things like intellectual
won't say I shouldn't use that word

637
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:42,350
said when it comes to things like this
entire bundle of the material

638
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:45,600
rights and legal legal rights that we

639
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,630
entitlements that we give to private
actors in society

640
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:53,270
I'm we are very bad at looking past the
enforcement

641
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:57,730
debate and it's very very lot and
basically all the undecided deputies

642
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:58,570
will still

643
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:02,740
default on enforcement and harsh
punishments or something like this:

644
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:06,020
which makes any more nuanced discussion
extremely difficult

645
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:10,580
think the only way to solve that is by
having a more aggressive

646
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:15,620
kinda debate maybe a member state level
so that politicians incentivized

647
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:19,250
to idk about copyright or patent
non-enforcement

648
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:22,760
times but I want to be clear about that
like

649
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,170
when we have a unitary patent
discussions it's not only soft recorders

650
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:27,360
that are affected by this

651
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:31,100
even be agree like we plant breeding
companies

652
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,620
and plant breeding companies are super
you just like the agricultural

653
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,390
industrial

654
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:38,529
complex you know goes to the European
Parliament days

655
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:41,880
we need readers exception and the
European Parliament is

656
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,970
unable to provide that in the patent law
soon and this is

657
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:50,470
they're by no means a disorganized group

658
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:54,910
lobbyists they're actually a very large
industrial complex and feeding on such

659
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,299
extreme difficulties

660
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:01,440
getting from you in patent law debate
and I think that really

661
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,140
tendered symbolizes just how lott

662
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:12,140
and missed up that political debate yes
okay thank you

663
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,200
any further questions 10 him

664
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,930
and you

665
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:25,390
mention that under European law when
someone develops software

666
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:28,430
a software developer the copyright
belongs to

667
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:31,899
whoever base for is

668
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,900
drop am but what is the situation when

669
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:39,309
software is developed I'm there European
funding

670
00:38:39,309 --> 00:38:42,559
so I'm thinking horizon 2020 is coming
up

671
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:45,749
a lot of software would be developed
within that framework

672
00:38:45,749 --> 00:38:49,140
also you talk about their image problem

673
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:53,529
the commissions like it some friendly to
open sourced

674
00:38:53,529 --> 00:38:56,640
I'm work for it on the other hand how
much open source

675
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,930
driving on the desktop server please in
the European Commission

676
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:05,149
and is in there maybe in sense of public
procurement laws for others but

677
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:08,579
when it comes with plagued what's that
what is the situation

678
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:12,239
there how much that there would be on
very

679
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:15,519
strong message being sent to the
Commission said

680
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,118
worked with options some

681
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,489
on the first question is me European
research funding used to develop

682
00:39:23,489 --> 00:39:24,299
software

683
00:39:24,299 --> 00:39:27,650
does it become open source and the
answer is it depends

684
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:32,380
on what the software was developed for
normally it will be the people

685
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:36,900
that a are participating in the project
that make the decision on how to release

686
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:42,329
the proceeds up there their project in
the rise in 2020 you

687
00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:46,549
remote program which is getting the new
research funds the European Commission

688
00:39:46,549 --> 00:39:49,999
has made a very very strong push towards
more open access

689
00:39:49,999 --> 00:39:54,379
and more open publication of results and
data and everything affiliated

690
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:59,160
process the European Parliament decided
to be more cautious about accepting

691
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:03,779
the virtues of openness in a way that at
least I am strongly critical of

692
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:08,039
and grandchildren the parliament went
that way because we'd be more

693
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:11,589
conservative than the industry and there
was really no good reason for us to be

694
00:40:11,589 --> 00:40:12,160
that

695
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,859
but I think somebody just had

696
00:40:15,859 --> 00:40:19,869
and mental lapse and didn't realize what
they were doing

697
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:23,880
on Suman

698
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,989
but when it comes to projects that are
developed this common infrastructures

699
00:40:27,989 --> 00:40:30,779
and even actually the very technical
projects if you look at

700
00:40:30,779 --> 00:40:35,279
previously announcing technologies for
instance or the European Union has a lot

701
00:40:35,279 --> 00:40:38,930
to work with that anything almost that
goes to once the government sector

702
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:42,348
unless you have a very very strong
industrial players participating in that

703
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:44,299
project they will normally be calm

704
00:40:44,299 --> 00:40:47,910
open also open source because the
Commission prefers that

705
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:51,899
know when your second question minus the
European institutions use

706
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,900
Microsoft products in on them and using
terminals

707
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:59,450
this is very simple because they are the
only actor which is capable of providing

708
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:02,519
technical infrastructure for maybe
thirty thousand people are sore

709
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:05,558
35,000 people and I happen to know died

710
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:09,019
even if you were to disagree with the
way that European Commission does its

711
00:41:09,019 --> 00:41:09,718
procurement

712
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:13,140
because it's something truly at the
digit I think

713
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:16,538
which is a unit that the commission that
this procurement an

714
00:41:16,539 --> 00:41:20,229
can be packaged EastEnders and then they
get replies and then they deploy the

715
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:21,919
infrastructure in on the

716
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,809
European institutions any if you have a
problem with the way that you're doing

717
00:41:25,809 --> 00:41:26,269
that

718
00:41:26,269 --> 00:41:29,348
you would have to challenge the
procurement proceedings so there are

719
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:32,109
some legitimate claims that you could
make the public defender's

720
00:41:32,109 --> 00:41:35,788
too soon they make requirements and
obviously can only be fulfilled by one

721
00:41:35,789 --> 00:41:37,009
vendor that kind of thing

722
00:41:37,009 --> 00:41:40,400
but when the peace from nation in Europe
has been looking for companies

723
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,200
in the face of a sec day to challenge
the way that the European Commission

724
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,348
does its procurement

725
00:41:45,349 --> 00:41:49,039
we haven't found any and at some point
if you're looking to go into the

726
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:52,099
procurement at the European level and
you have a problem with the maid

727
00:41:52,099 --> 00:41:56,170
get their software solutions you have
legal instrument with which you can

728
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:57,880
challenge the way they did the
procurement

729
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,289
and if you are unable to find anyone
willing to do that actually

730
00:42:01,289 --> 00:42:04,950
it's not good because we will still need
own computers the word

731
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:08,038
soon for us can do in the meantime

732
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:11,309
then using this solution from

733
00:42:11,309 --> 00:42:15,940
some but but if I think that cuz the
girl for the Free Software Foundation in

734
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,369
Europe

735
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:20,579
nobody would be any happier than he
would be if you went to him instead

736
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:23,829
listen I'm free software provider I
think that I could fix the European

737
00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:25,700
institutions please help me challenge

738
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:30,769
beaded and their procurement thank you

739
00:42:30,769 --> 00:42:33,999
any further questions on

740
00:42:33,999 --> 00:42:40,999
one writes back

741
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,890
hi this is a two part question

742
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:50,890
concerning public procurement

743
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:55,808
first part is a is that legal for
European states

744
00:42:55,809 --> 00:42:59,910
to say I will not accept the new york
tender

745
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:03,069
because it is based on open source and I
don't want that

746
00:43:03,069 --> 00:43:07,509
and the second part is is legal for
European states

747
00:43:07,509 --> 00:43:12,739
to say I will know that's that your
tender if it doesn't already work

748
00:43:12,739 --> 00:43:16,440
as I'm as software in another country

749
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:22,049
so the question is whether or not we
would be

750
00:43:22,049 --> 00:43:26,729
to be whether or not we would be allowed
to make a law at a member state level

751
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:29,839
that refuses a software solution that
isn't open

752
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:33,538
13 yes on

753
00:43:33,539 --> 00:43:37,119
and the second and the second question
was second question is

754
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:42,749
is the valid requirements to say that
for my states to accept this software

755
00:43:42,749 --> 00:43:49,749
it has to be installed in another
country as well in order for me to you

756
00:43:50,809 --> 00:43:54,420
procured the softer it would have to be
sold in another Member State as well

757
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:58,390
yes if

758
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:03,609
it is legal to see that for this tender
I will only accept software

759
00:44:03,609 --> 00:44:10,229
that is already installed in another
state on the first

760
00:44:10,229 --> 00:44:13,499
question i'd tone no

761
00:44:13,499 --> 00:44:17,649
actually I'm not sure if you're allowed

762
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:21,400
to at make the law in a member state

763
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:26,140
that prohibits the procurement all
specific substrate

764
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:30,098
like that prohibits the procurement a
proprietary software

765
00:44:30,099 --> 00:44:35,269
I would assume that you can only be me
but maybe it depends on the

766
00:44:35,269 --> 00:44:37,660
institutional framework in the Member
State to smile

767
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:40,749
some because your looks different mobile
so

768
00:44:40,749 --> 00:44:44,859
in Sweden I would find that difficult to
see how the government could make such a

769
00:44:44,859 --> 00:44:45,359
law on

770
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:48,910
since our municipalities have a very
high degree

771
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:52,269
I'll autonomy but I really

772
00:44:52,269 --> 00:44:56,519
wouldn't be able to tell and then the
second question

773
00:44:56,519 --> 00:45:00,149
and again I mean I am NOT

774
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:03,499
I'm not a lawyer and probe it could
depend

775
00:45:03,499 --> 00:45:07,328
between the members no because that's a
cross-border issues that would have to

776
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:07,759
be you

777
00:45:07,759 --> 00:45:11,519
the in the gas station I some

778
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:16,229
have no idea something to take away and

779
00:45:16,229 --> 00:45:19,939
think about right we're coming up to 10
swans

780
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:22,440
think we'll will draw a line under this
debate
