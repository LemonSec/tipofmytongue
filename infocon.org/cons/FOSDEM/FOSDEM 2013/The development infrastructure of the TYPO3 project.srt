1
00:00:01,579 --> 00:00:04,529
good afternoon everybody the next arc is
developments

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:07,759
infrastructure the table 3 project-based
stephan

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,330
give it so thanks for the introduction
and

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,440
thanks for listening to my talk and I'm
going to tell you in the next

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,650
couple of minutes a bit how type A 3's
development

6
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,769
of course what I Pistorius if you don't
know it so just to give you know if you

7
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:26,359
what you can expect from this talk

8
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,539
you will learn how to set up a project
infrastructure

9
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:32,680
unfortunately two times a bit short

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:38,100
do that maybe to see a perfect
development infrastructure into open

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,200
source because fear

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,000
well I think a pretty good but we're by
far not perfect so

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,469
um you we're getting some pics

14
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:51,920
impressions I think bad at least you
will learn how people in and other open

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,260
source project work

16
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:58,079
and you can see in our infrastructure
that's built from 100 percent open

17
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,020
source software

18
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:03,020
maybe you'll find some inspiration for
all

19
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,320
for your project and yet maybe we can
just getting

20
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,009
a touch together and yet discuss some
things and say

21
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:14,049
why don't you use this tool are using
that and I already got in touch with me

22
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:14,770
doob ke

23
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:18,640
I'm guys thought that would be really
nice to you have more connections to

24
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,000
other open source project

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,640
though us in this case is at Mina types
we don't talk

26
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,380
and most of our infrastructure is public
somewhere and get repose

27
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,199
some in doubt if you have interest in
something just ask us for free to ship

28
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,380
we have to share with you

29
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:39,000
somewhat about myself I used to be a
typed resume as cordoba Loper

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,759
I'm from 2010 until like a month ago
where decided to focus more on the

31
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,979
your infrastructure work in the server
administration team and in my day-to-day

32
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:49,979
job I'm a PhD student in

33
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:53,630
in computer science inverts burkina
center of Germany

34
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,520
but my email address in my Twitter and
love you want to get in touch with me

35
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,119
I'm we're happy to hear from you due to
two

36
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,909
I'm time constraints you might be able
to answer questions

37
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:08,000
just lights are already on slight sure
clutch adopt

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,540
nets the Stephen King and I'm at I also
added some comments

39
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,560
to them so what's type 3 most known

40
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,530
of the most well-known protect I'm a
product of the times we protect those

41
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,780
types 3c amass

42
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,730
its um content management system in PHP
basis

43
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,019
has more than five million downloads and

44
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,620
it yeah was started in nineteen
ninety-seven's orders yeah

45
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,290
bit cold bays and a long time of
development

46
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,000
and a community also brought I'm

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,360
to new products one is a PHP framework

48
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,970
I'm types reflow and if disount
interesting to you there was a talk by

49
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,670
to lead developer Robert them care I
guess you can watch it in the videos

50
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,920
after this conference and also there's
types we niels

51
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,290
'em a new content management system
which is currently in alpha stayed

52
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,220
based on types reflow sue

53
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,440
about a person's of times three
tapestries

54
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,450
community-driven open source terrorists
the wrong key

55
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:15,099
I'm sorry otto's was Twitter very sorry
for that

56
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:20,010
am dubs res community-driven open source
is no company behind only two types be

57
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:20,840
Association

58
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,550
for financial support but it's not a

59
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:28,890
bout paid work it's more about enabling
cause to bring people to

60
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:32,480
man called Sprint et cetera we have call
teams with

61
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,390
yeah like 10+2 fit 25 people who

62
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,809
you have to commit access and a lot of
contributors

63
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,080
so by preparing this talk I saw the pit

64
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,680
what requirements doesn't open source
project have

65
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,080
and I added identified ease

66
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,180
categories one is Scala racin and
communication

67
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,480
the other ones too was caught and the
source code and worsening

68
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,659
and quality assurance and testing and
documentation in translation

69
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:04,599
and I and the following I will present
you with the solutions we using forties

70
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,230
tasks

71
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,670
so you might also ask

72
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,859
why are using your own infrastructure
and why don't you use get up

73
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,030
um some point about this

74
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:19,809
cause of people think about just
migrating to get up

75
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:25,169
but one reason to be we have been there
before there was get up

76
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:29,258
I'm in the beginning when titles we were
smaller sauce pot was used for CVS

77
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:30,960
hosting

78
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,359
it started to being hacked sometimes it
was on reliable

79
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,139
so yet in the summer sometimes
everything was started in on

80
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:39,850
infrastructure

81
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,639
arm do most important point I think that
we own our data

82
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,020
in talk in the times of kid that's not
so critical because everybody has the

83
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,669
copy of the source code

84
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:52,849
but seems like all the issues which are
in the issue tracker

85
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,669
are yeah really worth some I'm

86
00:04:56,669 --> 00:05:01,320
time & work and we were also able to
just switch to issue tracker

87
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,530
like one year ago because if we have
yeah X 20 datum

88
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:09,229
and we haven't on account management
with all the teams

89
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:13,469
that wouldn't be just so easy to migrate
to totally different platforms we don't

90
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,050
have

91
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:19,150
you back in Texas to and the other
things that we want to provide a central

92
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:19,900
place

93
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,580
for the whole community

94
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,120
nevertheless to mid admitted amid costs

95
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,220
mountain sorry we opened two outs other
services which are freely available

96
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,000
and we used him for doing not so
critical things to you

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,169
and one thing to admit have caused this
cost some

98
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:46,169
some efforts to have and on
infrastructure

99
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,250
so the first point communication and
collaboration in table 3

100
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,020
many things are communicated through
mailing list and

101
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:02,140
decided also threw dem and dare you
since 2003 and

102
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,140
I'm it took 10 years to builder yurman

103
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,729
X is above word younger people
exercisable

104
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,470
an interface which is are forum which
was launched

105
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:18,940
last Monday and its based on foot form
and provides by directional

106
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,160
synchronization of mailing lists and use
groups and forums 0

107
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,800
we can now also linked to am mailing
lists threats et cetera so that's

108
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,240
I'm a pretty nice software and

109
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,580
arm that was pretty important for us to
finally Sep such an interface up because

110
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,229
decisions take place on the list and
does the transparency

111
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,680
that two types 3 let's say deciders

112
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,580
um yeah bring to what the other world
and people that don't read it dnt feel

113
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,630
offended because

114
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,280
they say what should I have you been
deciding dinner and

115
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,469
they don't see the discussion before so
that was I'm

116
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,670
important and on the other end we're
trying to really avoid internal

117
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:58,550
discussions

118
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,930
I'm so behind closed doors on internal
lists

119
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:05,810
um and try to yeah communicatins cleary

120
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:11,550
nevertheless we often still fail at this
on for 2p so another thing

121
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:16,210
um for collaboration is all fucked up
form on forged a tie between Aug

122
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:19,530
I'm we have a rep mine running their and

123
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:24,440
does offers project space for more than
20 for 2400 projects

124
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,120
so it's not for the yet topple other
products but also for

125
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,120
community extensions which are plugins
for typo3 CMS

126
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,250
and other for other teams like design
team or the UN team they all left there

127
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:42,100
I'm collaborations space tear and yeah
one interesting feature

128
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,800
one important feature with a is a
membership listing:

129
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,460
for different teams because um when you
say I want to contribute to dis

130
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:54,270
part of typo3 I'm who's responsible for
that

131
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:58,530
with whom should I get in touch so I'm
the good thing with

132
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:01,849
the red menace that problem lists just
all the memberships for different

133
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:02,860
projects and you can

134
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,130
to Skoda and seat that guys are
responsible and I can

135
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:09,580
get in touch with them and ask them and
what I can do for them

136
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,880
and it's the issue tracker full all the
projects

137
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,760
and that some want me out on your end
also

138
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,020
we're not so it's really happy with the
red minus

139
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,990
issue tracker to searches but limited
and especially when you're not

140
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:28,110
so family over for it so you have have
ideas how to improve Redmine search

141
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,020
really

142
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,990
I'm open to earth that I'm

143
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:37,760
other features affect like quickies per
pro check the Repository Browser

144
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,400
news time tracking the cetera says code
and worsening

145
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,400
with as the next topic arm

146
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,410
reusing it since meet 2004 one product
and other products

147
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:55,000
since the beginning of 2012 a 2011

148
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,820
um we're using a special flavor of kids
overcome two dead very soon

149
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,490
arm one known to the pundits still

150
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,560
because of us up means having limited
time

151
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,650
does not get official get support for
our community extended so

152
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:15,430
many of them are still limited to
subversion and we're about to change

153
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,370
that hopefully

154
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:20,760
within the next few weeks so

155
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:26,360
Cisco contrition was pretty short
quality assurance and testing

156
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,380
I'm yeah covers this topic now but again

157
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,920
I'm through code reviews so titles for
you

158
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,680
um is doing code reviews and the
motivation behind that is that

159
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,150
unfortunately bucks to exist it's pretty
sad

160
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:48,360
um we are ensuring our code quality you
through peer review so every change that

161
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,910
has to go in there which is not totally
tribunal

162
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,910
has to be peer-reviewed by at least two
other people

163
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,650
arm discussing the cold

164
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:01,170
improves it's Owen its easy that %um
proof at such a

165
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:05,740
yep a suggest that code change then it
leads to put just a better quality

166
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,589
instead of

167
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:11,100
I'm saying OK we week much it and
afterwards we make it clean and thought

168
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,220
it doesn't work usually

169
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:17,510
and so we doing to reviews before the
merch

170
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,560
I'm when we do it will once we have done
it others

171
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,930
it never worked really and to good thing
or the when your evenings

172
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,040
reviewing stuff from other people you
learn from them %um

173
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:33,209
learn how they called and they can say
why don't you use justice mothered its

174
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:37,750
I'm weekly in a real way faster and so
on

175
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,890
and although these reviews make the
development ran sprints to

176
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,870
transfer into the outside world people
can just go there and say

177
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,120
and see you why it was implement it this
way maybe

178
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,370
or why it was changed or not changed

179
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,800
and which brings us back to the special
flavor of

180
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,180
it is that we're using and Garrett code
review software for this court reviews

181
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:05,069
and Garrett is also or it's over

182
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:08,950
just to give you some spackman small
impression how

183
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:12,430
Garrett looks like you can go to review
to 2 types weiner dog and you

184
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:16,689
just see a list of all the pending
pictures

185
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:20,660
um who the all although is and to watch
project

186
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,839
it I'm the

187
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,880
refers to um once you soon into such an
issues you see you

188
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,829
again the owner and to which Bronx and
the state so it's still in review

189
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:38,719
you see the commit message and you see
devoting spy different people

190
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,350
um and your you need some positive
Maltings

191
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:46,780
to be able to really much debt change

192
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,670
there are also some 1i thinks you have
directly at: few

193
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:54,910
online in Garrett and you can comment on
singer lines and say

194
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:59,250
please do it is way over to it that way
and people can communicate and done

195
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,450
just upload a new patch set if

196
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,690
Garrett is interesting to you I'm and
yet by far not the only project using

197
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,420
Garrett

198
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,560
I haven't second talk here at 15:14 and

199
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:17,560
you're invited to just come back there
in C in detail how carrot works

200
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:28,879
so we also doing continues integration
and we of course have running in

201
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:34,050
Jenkins over which does yet the thing
which are just the usual choose for PHP

202
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:34,959
projects

203
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,149
and the interesting thing is that

204
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:41,269
Garrett automatically Watson carrot one
there is a

205
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:45,249
while Asian up to coding guidelines he
said around but we don't

206
00:12:45,249 --> 00:12:48,490
from to unit test and Gary in Jenkins

207
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,930
but I come to that later and left
metrics to type us we'll talk

208
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,430
a big sonar installation with 5,600
project so

209
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:00,779
although call projects plus the
extensions I'm which are listed there

210
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:05,800
and that presents you could metrics like
diplomatic complexities header on line

211
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,949
spur method

212
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:10,099
and so on so

213
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,470
we have Travis also as continues

214
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,370
integration software Travis is a hosted
service

215
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:21,769
so it don't have it on our own
infrastructure and it's built for the

216
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:23,110
open source community

217
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,149
and you know well what does Travis

218
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:30,220
other Dan Jenkins it still just executes
tests

219
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,309
but um it does it in a

220
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:36,389
were interesting way first it fetches
could frumpy top

221
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:39,980
only from get up that's a bit
problematic because you're

222
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:44,110
a set we hosting or own it's over so we
are replicating just get up

223
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:49,860
and Travis also supports um yeah plenty
of languages so it's not limited to PHP

224
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,709
though Travis CI

225
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:56,779
I'm just dot spins a virtual machines

226
00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:00,319
to run unit tests so you always have a
clean environment

227
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:04,839
you don't have headaches because you're
a which a machine got hacked or so

228
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:10,360
by unit s and it runs to meet different
environment that's interesting thing

229
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,629
for example you could say I want

230
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:17,850
PHP 5.2 to 5.4 and different databases
that builds up

231
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:21,709
I'm this metrics of test combinations
and

232
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:26,349
I'm Travis runs all of them and how
would you as a single developer find out

233
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:30,809
that dis combination fails Travis does
that for you ended

234
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:34,420
relaunched or different versions that
you are saying

235
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,049
it's a test and and reports back all
possible what feels

236
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:43,370
documentation translation type 3

237
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:46,519
um to translate

238
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:49,799
types for you and extension we having
poodle

239
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:54,029
installed Google is piping pages paid
Bass Pro checked

240
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:57,290
um and we're using X live format like

241
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:01,009
two years ago or so Fodor translations

242
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:05,870
and arm every night

243
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:09,929
language packages are built out of the
translations which are entered into

244
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:14,730
I'm poodle and people can go into two
types: reinstallation and say affects

245
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:15,790
translations and then

246
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:22,120
these pictures are downloaded who was
actually pretty nice it also offers

247
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,829
um for everybody to such as translation
so it's not a single team that does all

248
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:27,859
translations but

249
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,899
everybody can just come here with an top
three dog account not in

250
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:36,299
and such as the translation and team
members can

251
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:39,509
really a yet said dis translation active
or and

252
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:42,920
everybody can just two sector the chest
newt inflation's

253
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,160
documentation a

254
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,490
in open source project well

255
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,439
it was a wrap on perot point um for a
long time

256
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:57,920
arm probably not the only reason but one
reason

257
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,889
arm sorry feel free to him

258
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:05,779
I'm mill using restructure text feel
free to

259
00:16:05,779 --> 00:16:08,879
I'm what stirs lights on line

260
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,620
it's the really nice I'm format from

261
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,259
it's built for Python initially and yeah

262
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:19,870
I'm out there for questions nice that he
attended I'm

263
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:23,850
PCs through with lights and also to
comment on mine thanks for attending
