1
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:05,109
right

2
00:00:05,109 --> 00:00:08,389
thank you everyone so arm are we talking
about

3
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:12,829
Tracy come ulcer give you an
introduction to with the project is why

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:13,440
we did it

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,570
from up search began for use cases then
I'll go to the background how's work

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,650
present some features some went from
fish deals and future work in a real

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,459
sometime I'll present some more

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:31,460
work already done didn't use your work
alright so the main motivation is though

9
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:33,790
we

10
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:38,030
you want to tree system calls on
different architectures and different

11
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,800
platform so that would mean Linux

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,870
be used the et cetera et cetera as well
as some

13
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,459
into architectures a remark pictures et
cetera business kinda hard I mean

14
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:47,980
there's a

15
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,078
been

16
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:56,110
been

17
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:00,920
alright so from that we'd better

18
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,430
thank you alright so there is this from

19
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,689
system coco peat race and some

20
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:11,240
it's implemented in B is the in Lenexa
must be unique systems

21
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,158
but thats not very cross-platform in the
sense that the FBI divers on all

22
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,150
platforms

23
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:22,970
an architect is which is kinda to be
expected I guess be alright so we

24
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,960
provide system call tracing

25
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,619
and you can begin to system calls and
signals but you can also modify system

26
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:29,320
calls

27
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,589
which is a very useful feature and you
can even inject system calls

28
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,900
from use goes for it it's you this could
be

29
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,700
jailing processes so you can touch to
reach from process with Pete race

30
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,820
trestle system cause it's doing and
modify them sorry one picks a certain

31
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,669
files right certain files et cetera

32
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,670
arm you can do to spend on if I O which
we

33
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,329
implemented and we can promise you this
later arm

34
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:59,000
you can still be bugging replaying I or
whatever

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,719
you can do some fault injection by
modifying return codes at the system

36
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,658
calls to

37
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,210
savory rush out of memory in Yukon
allocate more memory

38
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:14,209
and you can too I love being alright so
we went a bit over the top

39
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,989
they're just now with just using the
term system call arm

40
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:21,870
out briefly explain a system called to
serve fundamental interface between the

41
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,030
application the kernel

42
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,400
and the hard road to reach the current
status through so

43
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,440
the way you can use you can through
contract with the hardware using your a

44
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,300
program

45
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,300
I am examples will be Rome very typical
examples

46
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:42,300
open right support for work we so

47
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,060
arm we didn't use the beatrice system Co
in Tracy

48
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,120
which is go pretty much the only way to
do it

49
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,050
efficient be from but we provide them
after cleared the woodwork from

50
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,989
other platforms and characters as well
um

51
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:01,010
songs at work basically with betrays you

52
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,909
I durst start a process and the process
as well please

53
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:08,730
trace one around during or you can
attach to an existing process

54
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,540
arm and then you can I do to help you
chose to

55
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,250
trap on every instruction sorry
instruction executed by the program will

56
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,230
stand your signal members will be
stopped and then you can do whatever you

57
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,209
want resume

58
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:26,260
or you can tell it's on the truck bomb
to some girls and signals

59
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,599
which is what we're doing because you're
is very slow in murder me to do it

60
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,399
um it's not worth your Petrosyan
actually POSIX

61
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,730
blue might think that abuse reported
both sexes action no

62
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,929
and well as I said it's no uniformity I

63
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:46,590
arm

64
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,390
so like a third arm obviously you are
lotteries event-based

65
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:54,000
so you consume luggage world I'm

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,180
tell me something when say that it is
using call this function and then you

67
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,090
can text me whenever you on that
function

68
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,400
the same goes for signals from

69
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,489
well business ample for me into the root
system call

70
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:10,159
and I'm calling this function you can
check system calls

71
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,579
when process suspended all talk about
this implementation later

72
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,430
and you can pretty reader writes memory
more quickly

73
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,889
most time depending on what your
commitments arm we have support for

74
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:26,040
both the Antarctic tourism and your
pictures and a room

75
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,729
and we have some bindings for piping
although we were everything in CC

76
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:36,729
as you can see I'm still alright so how
do we implement

77
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,680
a single injection this is kinda main
cora for work

78
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,290
site from just well you know tracing
system goes

79
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:50,160
easy arms or reduces when the program
from susan Collins stopped

80
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,460
and then we can do whatever we want we
can change the registers recanting see

81
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,969
instruction pointer Rican singer

82
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,190
stack pointer whenever from points on

83
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:02,719
and from so what we do is we holders
SystemC arguments are on the

84
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,960
in the register so we can change them
from region system call number:

85
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,909
and on the differences in growth
extradition arguments and 12 system goes

86
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,710
down

87
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,150
we recently instruction pointer to the
previous inspection

88
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,758
which was again system Co and restore
order resistors to what they were before

89
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:25,759
soldier on actually modify the program
aside from whatever fixins

90
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,990
on wheels to distinguish between
synchronous and asynchronous injections

91
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,780
are you can I just say I want to inject
a system call when we come to it

92
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,758
completes

93
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,550
or you can say he didn't exist in
Callington call this function when

94
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,710
you're done

95
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:41,580
which is my certain issue everything
from based

96
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:47,990
program

97
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,710
sorter different ways accessing the
memory when you're treating process

98
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,580
you can do this using a putrid system
Colbert for every word you have to call

99
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,310
that Beatrice it simple which is very
expensive

100
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,460
arm re you can use the special member
I'll

101
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,960
in the profile system which is
relatively fast and witches were using

102
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,469
but you knew some reason kernel for this
to actually write when small

103
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,310
and was very reason grounders also these
two system calls which

104
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:19,310
allow you to the same thing

105
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:24,300
okay so from what does what we did so
far we did some more workers with the

106
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,680
basic thing I wanted to

107
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,130
talk about arm so what we want to work
on his memory showing between the trace

108
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,210
unit racer

109
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:35,280
salute races to program your trees in
your three sir arm

110
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,880
uses for disorder if you say wanna you
wanna chill process

111
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,240
and the processes executing an open call
with some path

112
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,840
and you want to check the participants
found it done another threat in the

113
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,000
process is not anxious minutes with my
change a string assume you said well

114
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,160
there's no clue stream go ahead and and
open the file

115
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,069
so what you should do is computer string
to some save memory location which is

116
00:06:56,069 --> 00:06:57,669
indicated in the process

117
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:00,849
otherwise it can reduce France's call
emblem

118
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:05,289
make sure that most it's great to have
been defensiveness cutie opens com

119
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:08,990
from another big issue is missiles were
read in sport view the

120
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:13,080
but we're planning to what we can do dat
is though from when a process works in

121
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,750
the next you can set some special

122
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,000
of like which were immediately make
mixed-race your purse

123
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,210
but prices well but it doesn't work
amused D so we've made a solution for

124
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,440
this so we tested an expert but %um you
see

125
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,639
but it should work technically arm

126
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:31,199
spins a problem especially when you're
in a system calls arm

127
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,759
handling once a single requires for
complex which is

128
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:38,300
was was quite people have to Mike to the
process which which showed dual do

129
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,060
something

130
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,280
and I'm you can read conversion process
them UAL

131
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,559
be in charge again once a simple
completes its

132
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,060
kinda painful I'm can become restore
especially when you're chasing something

133
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,729
like Firefox

134
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:55,099
arm and an open research questions how
crossbar from we can actually just

135
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:58,050
because next was not a funky things

136
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:02,039
like using different system calls for
basic stuff like networking

137
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:05,430
on 32 bit that's the from them

138
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,639
64-bit through yeah

139
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:14,780
that's kind of a problem we can talk a

140
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:18,818
home in five left broke something

141
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:21,900
I guess few minutes alright so I guess I
covered

142
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,030
this

143
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,099
is just solution to verifying so the
argument

144
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:35,098
open and make sure the didn't change
much from thread

145
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,099
alright so this is more interesting arm

146
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:44,250
when you're running us like that before
system call neutrons created the news &

147
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,399
trailers military abuse team

148
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,380
so you need to execute before to some
colour clone or whatever system

149
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,330
whole creates a process in a safe
environments for which is kinda escapes

150
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,510
so you can attest to the process I'm

151
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:02,230
most recent

152
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:06,050
so we did is we checked some somebody in
the

153
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:10,189
prosper tracing and I am change in
fortune pointer to run into somebody and

154
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,690
you some you're basically

155
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,700
askew 24 call us and the new PID

156
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,089
so you can touch the process and unjust

157
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:22,480
do nothing and so you with a surprise to
new process and just

158
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:29,480
modified instruction pointer to move
away from this and the strip

159
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,060
finally like a ser despues an issue at
times and I wrote a small kernel patch

160
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,160
we would allow you to stow

161
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,230
or make good perpetrates not for you on
the absurd and system calls or

162
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:44,580
when simple doesn't match from Services
Inc also wants a black vest

163
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,700
and that really improve speed if you
just one say only choice you're right

164
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,180
arm it's not biggest employer and I did
in about three days but a

165
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:58,609
those works

166
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:03,240
so that's it arm is me and who to assume
fitted with the University of Amsterdam

167
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,760
I'm thank you for attention if you have
any questions and

168
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:13,760
shoe

169
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:27,820
why did he cry from his

170
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,500
help how is this different from P tracer

171
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,320
other tools that came before all right
sir peter is a tool we use

172
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,570
arm but Pete Rose's architecture

173
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:41,850
dependent so

174
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:46,070
like reading them his different on
architects whose I'm use the

175
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:49,660
you can read memory fast as you can
trace processes mom

176
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,630
system call numbers are different
architectures and usually when you look

177
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,060
at

178
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:57,040
programs and do like use betrays means a
report from sarajevo separate platform

179
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,899
file for

180
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:02,010
like first step is rest of secure more
specific

181
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:09,010
mission

182
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:18,780
on a questions

183
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,620
sorry the microphones coming

184
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:27,360
so it would be virtually a question your
I

185
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,470
I was so wondering whether you will

186
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,390
upstream to buy cheese for Derby trace
this does is call

187
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:37,750
selection no be interesting to me
personally right arm

188
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,930
world there some rule main problems were
and that is

189
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:44,219
them this has been tried before this
kind of partisan was

190
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,160
rejects because was incomplete an order
something I think it's called sir

191
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,270
secure computing succumb in the kernel
which does something similar but doesn't

192
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,220
allow you to

193
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,730
unser which symbols you wanna trees
which is kinda

194
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:00,270
paying I mean for Joan would work but in
general it's not complete yet

195
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:04,120
so this was more to prove concert was
around the time

196
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:11,120
I might look at see if I can give it to
me my bottom purple would be very hard

197
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,740
with me like 30 seconds ago from the
show demo well

198
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,070
mine works you know if time for a quick
ago

199
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:28,070
okay what I will show you is a program
we made which will trace

200
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,870
all be suffered calls and rewrote I'll

201
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:36,370
like he will connect to a proxy server
other than the actual server

202
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,460
a sub up the socks I for protocol and
unjust

203
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,910
some the room a bite so you can
transparently road all network traffic

204
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,550
on the to secure this moment over
program I'm in a very small

205
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:53,550
video so I hope its visible but we'll
see

206
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,540
right to adjust from program twice once
with our like

207
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,139
home for switches on cruel which will
return on some IP and then we'll run

208
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:20,940
with our transparent networking

209
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:26,310
and you can see the appeal to different

210
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:29,388
it's a very simple concept but it works
on Firefox and

211
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:31,060
programs function
