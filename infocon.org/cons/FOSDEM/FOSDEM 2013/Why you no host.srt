single web sites at two creates

17
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:11,979
when it comes and many times

I don't know but I E I heard about

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,689
some security or by the sea problems the
term

22
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:32,360
as to tell you something I am

23
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:39,360
I don't read a terms up services so

24
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,040
he didn't

25
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,229
I also am

26
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,240
heard about something called

27
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:54,298
cell forcing and actually

28
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,719
it was pretty good was pretty good

29
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,850
a.m. there well like

30
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,520
a.m. many many applications

31
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,919
available I mean federated at the
cations

32
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:13,140
and I'm I

33
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,660
I had for every single use H

34
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,690
I had in the cloud I had

35
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,129
an application that's do the job in my
own server

36
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:29,569
I mean

37
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:36,569
free softer so

38
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,220
I thoughts Swiss its was really good and

39
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,420
the first problem II song was that's

40
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,780
a.m. my mom counts

41
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,330
install them and less its

42
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,940
even if its it's a such great saps

43
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,849
I mean I used round cue and set up Gmail

44
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:03,399
I used on Cloud they didn't

45
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,349
have to store anything on Dropbox of may
go butts

46
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:12,530
yeah you know my mum don'ts

47
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:15,720
don't do that's kind of thing in staying

48
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,090
a Picatinny on use on her

49
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,340
on server so what that was problem

50
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,700
and points is

51
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,679
that we wanted to feel the gap

52
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,400
between use the use a chip

53
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,220
thats cannot applications and

54
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,980
a.m. did thickness City

55
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:49,000
to install them and we wanted to

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,049
make a simple solution to

57
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:59,569
to do that's so

58
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:03,488
what's what do that we actually needs

59
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:07,750
what do we want for that's kind
absolution

60
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,569
we won't

61
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:14,689
some

62
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:18,250
some one stable relabel

63
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,570
in easy to install operating system
actually

64
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,729
a.m. maybe a some kind of

65
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:29,609
Debian thing you know

66
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:33,400
in we wants also

67
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,830
a nice rest services in when I said
that's is more

68
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:41,070
must have services that's although

69
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,190
that some everyone what's

70
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,190
like may JavaServer

71
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:53,719
the web so basic services

72
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,690
we also wants and that's not an option

73
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,750
secure protocols

74
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,229
in order to while I want to

75
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:07,659
on tele much about security but Sir once

76
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,470
secure protocols

77
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,880
and wants firewood gestion

78
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:22,880

79
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,919
im we wants term

a multi-user new to domain

81
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:37,609
a.m. meets and events may just win

82
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:41,169
because we want to create accounts on

83
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:46,240
a.m. on our server for for instance my
brother

87
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:04,259
configuration management's

88
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:09,020
with a a user-friendly interface because

89
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:14,109
I don't want to just and

90
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:17,330
I mean administrators held up manually
some

91
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:22,120
finger like that

92
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,539
and wants a simple way to

93
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:30,020
for developer to adopts applications

94
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:34,919
to our solution and simple way to users

95
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:38,650
for users to install applications that
applications and

96
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:45,650
that's new services potentially

97
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,930
we also wants

98
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:56,440
we you would be nice to have some kind
of single sign-on

99
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,960
in order in order to have one account
for all applications

100
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,409
Julie and a.m.

101
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,479
would be cool to have a command line
interface you know

102
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:12,750
but yeah for

103
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,199
my brother

104
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,020

admits thats we already have

108
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,349

such great services

117
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,620
substrates applications said don't waste

118
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:15,789
and

119
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:18,930
we all read we already have the

120
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:24,129
the possibility great that's but from

186
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,359
that much now domains but we have an
application

187
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,550
system which is now we have for like
five applications right now

188
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:37,140
letting the second version we them to
have

189
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:41,280

00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:28,679
of person station and to a kind of a
sixty interface

244
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:35,680
you know the tomb to manage all that's
easily

245
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:45,119
could I possibly convert an existing
dependence tradition you know

246
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:48,158
and an existing devastation you could

247
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:51,289
its a.m. way

248
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:55,539

Dion existing systems butts

252
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:09,478

00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:16,869
question I want to ask first to is this

already have seven but he's not at your
home you can

279
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:52,988
you can insights easily the

280
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:56,149
but some it's also

281
00:19:56,149 --> 00:19:59,209
provide solution for 400 on server:

282
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:03,619
from for home servicing the both are
possible

283
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:08,228
because it's based on Debian but of
course

284
00:20:08,229 --> 00:20:11,669
life he there's those a lot of

285
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:14,720
different problem to consider eights

286
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,349
install a server from a up to

287
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:24,320

291
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,889
it is it is but to actually we

292
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:46,289
already John translated into French Anna

293
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:49,910
English and yup but he

294
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:53,110
could be possible to slated Brazilian

295
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:59,330
but I

296
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:03,020
what about backups from we plannin

297
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,020
second version only throughout the

298
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:09,039
a kind yeah attend the

299
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,710
way of backup the

300
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:16,010
this is not the case info session and
that's it really

301
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:19,250
yup that's an issue G a.m.

302
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,860
that yeah we blended to withdraw from in
the second person

303
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,110
a.m. it sees will be like

304
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:30,280
and networking local backup bus festival
and

305
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:37,280
this is

306
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,760
I'm what's a process to package or
install new apps

307
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,790
0 a and so

308
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:52,920
in the first version is quite
complicated because you have to

309
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,780
make packages to be in packages a in the

310
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,820
the second one we bays we

311
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,149
wheelbase the the application system on
gets

312
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:06,710
so if you have any web applications
existing

313
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:09,980
you were just up to feel a manifest

314
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:14,930
which will be which will be the manifest
like

315
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:18,290
them Firefox OS web at manifest

316
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:22,830
is and stuff like that and you you will
have to

317
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:28,929
scripps your installation for example
%uh to initialize to

318
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:32,240
my school Mayes killed database or
something

319
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,470
later and the that will be all

320
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:39,230
we wants to we really wants the

321
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,970
application packaging to be easy because
the

322
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:46,000
we will have

323
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,350
some tender for on application bottom in
order to

324
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,639
to the soul that's and you

325
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,890
we want some sums we wants do the
application web application developers

326
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:01,420
to to do that to do that job

327
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:05,160
because in the first session we package

328
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,570
geppi some cloud and I'm glad these is
still in

329
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:11,810
I mean for vision because we didn't end

330
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:17,480
after time to upgrades so for them for
