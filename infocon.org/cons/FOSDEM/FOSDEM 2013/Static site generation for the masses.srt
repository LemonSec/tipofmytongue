1
00:00:01,329 --> 00:00:03,149
I'm so I'm going to

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:06,859
helmet artistic side generation first

3
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:11,070
over me Anthony

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,210
you can find me Twitter

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,130
and did elsewhere just google

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,779
like many of you I am a software
engineer

7
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:26,448
and I and the author of non ok

8
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:30,849
is a so excited generator which will be
the subject of this book

9
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:34,690
to I know that many of you

10
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,669
least a few have already used so excited
generators

11
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,180
for those who don't I'm going to give

12
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,519
quick review boys sex I don't us

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,110
so 1i Reid confirmed for my web sites

14
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:54,079
and I prefer to write it mode I'm more
down

15
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,250
is a file format basically plain text

16
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,190
and it looks like this these are aswan

17
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:05,048
paragraph followed by a list been up for
crafters and

18
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:08,850
emphasize words and down document

19
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,429
easily be converted to intestinal
fragment which looks like this

20
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,590
yep actual original coming out there

21
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,720
but at it still fragment its North

22
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,939
entirely politician that for the
slacking either an 8-footer

23
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:27,020
this sidebar there that content

24
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,789
is in daily out and the

25
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,930
they are looks could make like this this
is a really really

26
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:40,509
basic example at the point where does
youth statements

27
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:43,920
that that's where the clinton is going
to be inserted

28
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,990
you have the HTML fragment and the way
out and both of them will be combined

29
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,949
together

30
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,140
in order to form the final original
documents

31
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:57,270
documents will then be written to disk
and you can

32
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,750
uploaded you when you can

33
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:07,450
upload it to you and the any web server
sir

34
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:11,629
that's really easy it's really easy way

35
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:14,929
as a simple way so excited work

36
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:20,970
course can get a bit more complex than
that there

37
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:26,379
why experience with a quip website
generations when I had a PPS a virtual

38
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,500
private server

39
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,560
96 migrated from and I didn't want to

40
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,500
keep on using PHP for my website so I
want to use

41
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,250
we unfortunately on a six mile or so
from

42
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,430
really is not enough previous way more

43
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,959
resource-intensive and thats so it was
too slow

44
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:51,790
basic basically I couldn't host why Ruby
website

45
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,629
on this PBS so I had to take a different
approach

46
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:58,870
around that time frontline

47
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,840
we sitting right there wrote a script

48
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,840
sorry not you throughout his scripts for

49
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,170
generating thought excites he made a
simple script

50
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,700
generated just its channel which is
really easy actually

51
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,250
spar there and decided to take the same
approach

52
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,250
for knock which spying projects

53
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,610
since it's written in Ruby and will be
is a programming language that

54
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,970
originates in Japan also include

55
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,310
o'connor its means that

56
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,870
you know new how to pronounce it openly
right

57
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,920
and also Lost Weekend

58
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,480
there's an you know website and also in
you

59
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,768
while ago after six years

60
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:49,379
it's fun as a local and I even have
stickers

61
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:52,689
issuance the group can get some

62
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:56,989
for ok

63
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:00,739
is not a CMS similar to the complement
system

64
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:05,250
that's not what it is what is it

65
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,280
it's a sexci janitor and I propose

66
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,170
least using the term SSG from because

67
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:16,180
so excited than it was are getting more
popular also

68
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,519
all them say later on this or for

69
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,040
I think this is G is really nice

70
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,380
abbreviation and it's ok it's going to
be all

71
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,389
messages will not be seeing thanks I do

72
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:33,449
that generator in full as I just stumble

73
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:37,150
works astrakhan see right

74
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,179
through airport is so is first

75
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,919
or so exciters already explained a bit

76
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:49,210
the for or whether a capable it's a
really powerful

77
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:53,008
I'm costly we'll expect some

78
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:56,270
something about the lessons I've learned
and also

79
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:01,460
future work this is still we don't or

80
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,960
as Jesus are the mentioned that

81
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,250
basically you have a directory with so
more

82
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,710
downfalls or more than like files

83
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,169
look like this shown you

84
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:19,060
but here is something else you can also
assign

85
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,560
arbitrary me to later so through the
title here

86
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,849
the layouts also include up mutilated

87
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:29,870
item title on Indy

88
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,120
title like in the head like this

89
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,310
right that it will be written directory
structure like this

90
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,479
I up that to create index 2.html

91
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:44,570
files you have a clean URL structure

92
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,030
makes it sound really simple

93
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,448
not powerful at all but you can build
sites like

94
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:56,340
all course another website itself just
not built using Google

95
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,179
this they get a developer resources

96
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,770
it guided meditation is all written
another even though get her

97
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,969
YouTube has their own solution for
stocks identical

98
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:11,560
jekyll they prefer another quarter
documentation

99
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,330
presses much more powerful miss line
website

100
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,900
is a website bills a few years ago

101
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,580
demonstrated its what's possible built

102
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,770
able to link all website without just
from scratch

103
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:30,539
without modifying on itself the up but
not

104
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:33,770
mentation and the flow through the
condition also

105
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:38,198
using 1 I'm particularly proud of is
that business

106
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:42,150
agree but decide is all mates entirely
with Nana

107
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,590
another final agree but with lakeside

108
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,599
sp API documentation

109
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,880
and of course as a this additional

110
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,990
members the 14th but itself which is
both good for a

111
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,089
but I've been talking about knock

112
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:06,120
no it's not the only tool out there year

113
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,330
with

114
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,430
minutes deliberately slow

115
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,529
there's a few I would like to highlight

116
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:19,830
of course this knock with this also
jekyll

117
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,539
rip for from get her use it for good for
pages

118
00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:28,010
refuse good pages will likely use jekyll
ok to oppress

119
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:33,409
the framework builds on total jekyll for
blocking basically it gives you a

120
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:34,550
starter kits

121
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:38,010
really easy start yet so walking

122
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:42,080
middleman also pretty popular community

123
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,460
I think it's I'm a competitor do this

124
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,919
Anderson High cool which is written by a
friend of mine

125
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:53,770
it's written in high school its really
popular in high school or so if you

126
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:57,650
like high school and don't like Ruby
should give it a try

127
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,198
unfortunately this list is incomplete

128
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,490
I'm I already

129
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,690
a good this list with them out to really
highlight

130
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:12,539
individual names are so excited and it's
just that I wanted to

131
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:16,159
talk about butter in the meantime I the

132
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:20,490
tune you so excited so the or local you
once

133
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:23,779
showing up didn't that this is going

134
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:27,360
maybe today there's nothing

135
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,580
you know this is an example of a jekyll
sites

136
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:35,990
from get a pages is another one

137
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,959
get two pages complete can use to see

138
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:44,218
looks like the looks a bit like this
than this most likely going to be built

139
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:48,980
ok so so why would use that excites

140
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,500
custer obviously less dynamic

141
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,170
Memphis well they are very fast because

142
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:59,229
you compile your site to sell tickets to
the mall

143
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:03,970
served really quickly for a secure
server also include that proper lost

144
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,709
more fight and beat like others

145
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:08,930
a secure econ packets that excites

146
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:13,209
there are no explosive because that's
not good running works with your own

147
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:15,829
tools which i think is really important
so you can

148
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:19,250
at your content with for example them or
the max

149
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,750
sublime pics whatever you prefer on both

150
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,300
is in place thanks to you after content
is in some kinda

151
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,410
your formats or database you don't
notice chemo

152
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:32,900
it's really easy to deploy just uploaded

153
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:37,100
or sink with the word is to bring
preview

154
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,069
to compile its to your all local
computer

155
00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:44,140
when you can just you have the Falcons

156
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:48,329
the weather okay or not makes
cooperation easy

157
00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:51,469
which I will demonstrate this creature
from the good

158
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:56,160
oversight which is open source people
sample requests

159
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,300
and modify that way so it's become a
community

160
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,810
open source project basically that

161
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,160
wats that excites others generators like

162
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,839
overview so already capable what makes
them really really cool

163
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:17,709
in they'll all but three minutes later
so ever

164
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:21,599
shown you that you can at title to a
blog

165
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,490
post that's nothing special this chicane
sign the title in

166
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:31,490
your CMS with the issue but I can also
write me today to like this

167
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:35,010
this is a review by road for a
breakthrough to the

168
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,350
game I reviewed in 2008 agree with

169
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:43,140
5 stores is a Seattle sick and that's
that then

170
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:48,180
with in the anything like if you have

171
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,839
list of issues then you can through
overall you refuse

172
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,980
Prince proper number of stores

173
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,079
all about to be title such

174
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,930
you know limited to work the CMS gives
you

175
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:05,089
you have for power with all the time

176
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:09,170
and assisted this'll

177
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,529
filters is Miller useful thing

178
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:17,589
word is shown you that is more done you
can also use exile

179
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:21,060
and totally out your be or you can use

180
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,109
mustache which is which is a bit
prettier

181
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:27,880
analysts much more compact also pretty
popular

182
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,449
and yes filters like all right syntax

183
00:11:31,449 --> 00:11:35,069
bit of code website this month up using

184
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:39,990
class course language: Ruby which is
forty external fire specs

185
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,630
says you should do than go pick it up

186
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:48,290
I'm call right its we have really pretty
colours

187
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,480
I hope because readable variable

188
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:58,199
you okay typing ruby is an example the
library that cleans up your pics

189
00:11:58,199 --> 00:12:01,359
basically support kurds proper bashes

190
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,569
thats Asus such

191
00:12:04,569 --> 00:12:07,599
you can write your own filters easily

192
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,920
this example easel sensor fillers

193
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,050
your own replaced or insists of

194
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,339
knock sucks Rex which has a nice

195
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:21,300
vintage that issue grew Fort Knox in the
gets consensus

196
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:26,140
overnight documentation

197
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,790
for now you have three others how the
you

198
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,990
Toler when to use them that's the point
using

199
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,569
rules for your you have

200
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:39,860
much everything's all

201
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,050
iTunes if it. kind because

202
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,370
or to call venues because filter which
is

203
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:51,100
IMO down implementation followed by
default they are

204
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,380
can also process winery iTunes

205
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,770
here I say run image optimize over

206
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,880
that's a lot built in filter but you
could say maybe

207
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,189
PNC PNG crusher something

208
00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:08,959
you can also create a group in patients
who received much you creating

209
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,170
another output file but this time

210
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:15,270
it's a thumbnail and to get to the Tamil

211
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:18,579
during the skillful for with a with all

212
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:22,410
240 pixels and use them

213
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:26,530
another example you could say take all
my blog articles

214
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:30,669
and I'm creating a separate with full

215
00:13:30,669 --> 00:13:37,079
for mp3s you can say okay I'm going to
use a filter which will make a list and

216
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:40,459
good think that text and creatine AI

217
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:43,579
while containing basically

218
00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:47,829
spoken Texas speech your that article

219
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:51,760
the new lame to get an mp3 file
absolutely useless

220
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,850
I would recommend doing it but it shows
power

221
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:59,030
the rules and filters

222
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:02,220
wide

223
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,620
I assume you're almost your from you
make finals

224
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:10,250
miss think this is but too much make
calls

225
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,850
offer you it's summer but there are a
few

226
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:17,199
differences make calls to define

227
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,459
what's targets you have what I could
fall through have

228
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:24,119
and then you def also define how to get
to the output for us

229
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,660
rules to just specify how to prove

230
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,990
process input files and

231
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,850
you don't care what they are with is
their words written to do it before and

232
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:35,750
I'll

233
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,079
that's the pool forces push the same

234
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:42,870
possibly rules or have a clear syntax

235
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:46,209
new your variables like or store

236
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:49,229
or greater than

237
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:53,850
whatever this I can never remember

238
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:57,380
and do molecules offer

239
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,910
dependency tracking so if you have one
item includes content

240
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:04,559
from another item which denigrates
condom from another item

241
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,510
you modify this heightened

242
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:14,510
the dependences food truck for the ride
I since we we compiled

243
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,610
helpers but like Ruby on Rails

244
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:20,610
you just have module has song

245
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,939
functions pataki help her with it
function

246
00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:26,939
buttons for track which you can use in

247
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:29,959
basically whatever you want so

248
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:33,319
here's what I'd Bates say

249
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:38,130
other backs for this this items for this
seller

250
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:42,030
you just the so this was supposed to say
items for Jack

251
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:47,260
tax Harrisburg just threw it over all
the items and print them

252
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:51,559
like to them we have a link to help
resolve the conflict tonight

253
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:57,689
virtually this all mile compile
statically

254
00:15:57,689 --> 00:16:00,990
so with all this that I've shown you
became

255
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:04,459
bill is so excited but it quickly

256
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:08,819
16 or do you not you will find that your
virtual

257
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:12,559
is going to have changed but
significantly

258
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:15,860
this two steps basically when you're
working

259
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,470
website first of all development to
write content

260
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:24,189
and at some point to decide okay we are
going to publish the website

261
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:27,890
while you're doing development course
you want to use for control because you

262
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:28,569
have played

263
00:16:28,569 --> 00:16:32,299
X-files as ideal for version control

264
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:35,380
this reserve history of your project but
you can also store

265
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:39,000
using branches website something

266
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,319
to the school ski mask and up to of
course

267
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:46,120
history long branches and issue

268
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:53,120
through your website and get her then
you can use poor request school

269
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:57,849
people can for your project rights in
the content or fix

270
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,030
typos with over and

271
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:04,569
all skewed to merge their changes
through

272
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:07,869
your project okay so that

273
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:11,520
article works if you're preparing for a
release

274
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,230
he will obviously want to improve your
site to compose side

275
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:19,789
preview with locally buddy obvious

276
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:23,379
and secondly the release

277
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,750
of made lost weekend

278
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:31,140
supports checking which basically means

279
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,740
automated testing for your southern
upside sex like followed

280
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,059
HTML CSS both internal links

281
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:44,418
quite important politics to release a
social it's also quite customizable

282
00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:47,710
lastly the course of course

283
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:51,020
you can use or sink for example which I
prefer

284
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,370
some people other or output as a gift
because

285
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:58,250
we which they commit to it again after
compiling

286
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,460
Bush your which they repose

287
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,110
3 posts worshipers committee ok

288
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:08,199
on the server which those the

289
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,390
so life on

290
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,660
feature that I like spoons

291
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:19,710
be really useful is data sources which
basically allow you to

292
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:25,039
dictator from and he scores and imported
into no

293
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,049
I'm going to give you an example you
know plates

294
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:32,179
upside has 3 data sources

295
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:35,500
if us the filesystem us what you

296
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,299
normally use just going to end on your

297
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:42,760
foster there's that more like interface

298
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,539
datasource which

299
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:49,720
votes okay so

300
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,020
the knocking on line interface is the
point to sing in internal

301
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,179
VDSL like this

302
00:18:56,179 --> 00:19:00,960
actual use while using our commitment by
notifying this way

303
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,260
also house run/walk which is executed in
uniform to come

304
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:09,690
but this this data

305
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:14,220
this definition issues through first all
generates come online helps

306
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:19,460
say on a call some command and it will
show you

307
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,460
the all with for the course

308
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,380
and all that but you can also use it as
a data source

309
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:30,380
and then you can generates also help on
the right side

310
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:35,710
so this is an example I define to come
out there sexy one place

311
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,860
and then its propagated to come online
help

312
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,799
and the website

313
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,039
filters or document its

314
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:49,640
basically all my source code is
documented

315
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,049
which is really cool because it the new

316
00:19:53,049 --> 00:19:56,960
can generate

317
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,480
come online well I'm you can

318
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,490
generates ok if Kyle accommodation

319
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:07,929
is an example filter to scrutinize

320
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:12,110
it's nice this documentation is nice if
you want to

321
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,789
so if helping but if you

322
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:19,210
only want to use it and the conditions
sucks because you know it's

323
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:23,539
you you can see the forest through the
trees

324
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:28,309
what I'm using to Janet this is your
book your look is a ritual

325
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:32,330
generates this is simple it works in two
steps

326
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:36,620
personally think the source codes to its
a database containing

327
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:41,070
API documentation this ago the condition
is then converted

328
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:46,110
to HTML ok can use that data base

329
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:49,320
in fact with through with it the source
and then imported in

330
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,939
website and then you can generate really
nice looking

331
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,400
documentation very very focused only two
points

332
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,760
from the condition relevant its

333
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,500
also automatically generated again

334
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,850
I document these filters only in one
place

335
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:13,428
and its appear sparsely populated
completion and website

336
00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:17,419
the same is true for for the helpers

337
00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:20,570
also documented so this is basic you

338
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:27,570
extract spring carrier condition

339
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:31,330
thats the sources for monoxide

340
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:35,520
one website also uses

341
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,379
data sources

342
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,549
at the use to

343
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:46,520
the out the all system data source

344
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,460
obviously but also anti-war and
printable or

345
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,669
is conference planning system use

346
00:21:54,669 --> 00:21:56,059
sure

347
00:21:56,059 --> 00:21:58,809
speaker than you attracted it's
basically

348
00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:02,720
its stores speakers

349
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,299
rooms tracks advance anything

350
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:09,330
swing both ways and from that

351
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:12,519
too so the the for them upside

352
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:16,090
as a data source of loads the data from

353
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:19,209
for them from the punter for system

354
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:22,500
and its HTML

355
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,510
like that you all data available

356
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:29,059
its all loaded and

357
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:32,080
you can reorganize it I'm

358
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,379
so for example creates

359
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,809
pages were tracked workroom over

360
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:43,480
even for an entire day so this is old

361
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,080
with now and

362
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:51,529
this if you want to learn more about how
this works

363
00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:54,690
then you can go to get help from class
both

364
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:58,090
such website which is

365
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:01,740
and open source replaces for the first
time

366
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,529
the Folsom outside is now entirely
open-source

367
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:12,529
thing at this hookah place ok

368
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:17,990
you may have to set up on top of the
good work is

369
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:22,110
it's out there learn from it for

370
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:25,419
my experience with this is Jesus would
be a few things

371
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:32,330
but the advantages so the animals as
excited as more than just mowed down

372
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:35,679
plus a fancy doubts converted to HTML

373
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,250
you can use it that way on the personal
website and that's that's fine as well

374
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:43,880
you can too much more as people them
upside

375
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,980
group its it satisfactory

376
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:51,580
money money money cases sorry for them
outside his small tits with the website

377
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:54,970
but its its is due to maintain

378
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:58,830
us as man outside it would also

379
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:02,330
and miss think we're also excited static
so it's

380
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:07,399
its likes but I'm yes but you can work
around that

381
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,500
which I'll skip and works find in most
cases

382
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,930
I'm insane all cases its

383
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:19,430
more than enough more than what you need
and the

384
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:22,510
goal I think more of a long-term goal

385
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:25,879
I think so excited generation general

386
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,310
is that if you have data then you can
use

387
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:32,639
to like through published that data

388
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,220
up converted to something really nice
HTML

389
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:40,710
make it public fiercer accessible bus

390
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:44,460
basically wonderful said those as well
than

391
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,210
only one this restore their conference
data

392
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:52,680
and thats milt

393
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:57,000
copied and pasted and you okay

394
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,610
while developing

395
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:04,020
of course I you were things

396
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:07,680
that's why reasons why assortment

397
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,790
for six years and I

398
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:13,899
work minutes to challenge myself have
issue

399
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:18,040
lessons going to share with you first
thing is I wasn't real

400
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:22,680
the S l's an internal de eso looks like
this

401
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:27,010
the rules while its internal DSL

402
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:31,430
say compiled the about-face I am I going
to processes

403
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:35,550
Crombeen which is mode on implementation

404
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:38,550
as you may have noticed loading

405
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:41,850
impressions over could come

406
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:45,060
at least three wins but thats not
through irrelevant

407
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:49,840
but you can abuse this sir the rules
file

408
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,629
suppose to be inside the car but its
Ruby so you can do

409
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:59,410
people thinks shows this in here

410
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:02,930
I say okay when you think about this
this page then

411
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:07,090
great open going to write

412
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:10,889
some content to another file that's
completely

413
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:14,150
related so abusing

414
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:18,140
the system like there's no side effects
this

415
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:23,210
really no way around that I suppose that
at school has the upper hand there

416
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:26,860
but simply camp

417
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,350
into people

418
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:34,840
another problem is credibility so you
could

419
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,669
right there in like this I'm compiling
or pickles here

420
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:42,600
and the item

421
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,360
has no attributes coldly out company
said it through

422
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,659
cortical than by run

423
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,800
I use that attributes to find it the
Arts family

424
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,139
the arm thing it's using the article
where that looks fine

425
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,810
that's the problem is that you actually
changing

426
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:04,429
spirits here the if that attribute
issues

427
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:09,340
elsewhere and this old accomplished may
be different

428
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:13,470
whether this rule his room at the
beginning the completion process

429
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:17,630
at the end it trips up the defense
instructor

430
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:20,820
and and so on as well so well though

431
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:25,810
what I did is I just freeze everything
so in Scopus and starts to account for

432
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,260
the fight

433
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:30,420
anything which seems like a throwback

434
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:34,710
but its lows it to going to the compiler

435
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:38,720
optimizer make assumptions because I
knew

436
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,990
data it's not going to change and you
don't lose

437
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:48,990
any power don't lose any flexibility
another issue

438
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,830
is speed

439
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:56,970
same you think all you have your site
it's compiled

440
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:01,160
it's on the server it you can't really
go any faster

441
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,470
that's not nice cool and you'd be right
but

442
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:09,190
the actual compilation process itself
obviously also takes time

443
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:13,310
if you have a website with two thousand
pages

444
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:17,710
I do need to compile from scratch and
you

445
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:21,620
still needs to need to process these
first two-time

446
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:26,360
items and if they take a half a second
and you will have to wait

447
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,439
there's no way around that but

448
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,820
those tools and techniques to improve
that

449
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:36,409
for example agreement the compilation

450
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:39,450
basically meaning only recompile

451
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,930
what's necessary

452
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:46,560
for reduces the complexity from with
your

453
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,700
in the number of items at least when you
remember

454
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,810
items to than your this

455
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:58,659
in the world changed items

456
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:02,200
that makes it look trivial whom you girl
look for the change

457
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:07,040
bridges recompile those but that's not
enough

458
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:11,190
two scenarios for example yeah want page
that has changed

459
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:15,210
obviously you recompile page

460
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:18,530
but if you have a change page that is
included

461
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:22,629
and work page than unity cue track
dependencies

462
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:26,080
and recompile also your page that
includes

463
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,879
change space what if you change the
rules

464
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,880
if you change the rules then

465
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,450
you need to figure out what the rules
change

466
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:42,520
what the effect of that rules changes
that's not reveal

467
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,730
manic does that effectively I think

468
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:50,340
do with treating the nobody notices it
works perfect

469
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:56,550
in all cases

470
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:00,490
but there's still some work to be done
school

471
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:03,750
if you care about speed then you should
pick the right way Brees

472
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:07,410
pick the right fielder's so example

473
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:11,480
if you think that thing sport coats

474
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,630
is a good thing excellence

475
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:18,000
and you can use really pants which is a

476
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,630
we port more defense example

477
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:26,420
basically those libraries we present a
groovy

478
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:30,070
make reports more time properties

479
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:33,909
such but like a group leaders more

480
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:37,780
rebounds and they are those long so I've
been

481
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:41,680
working alternative my own

482
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,760
hold fast I like its

483
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,260
I don't think even posted States

484
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:53,140
I hope to release its in the coming few
months

485
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:56,210
preliminary preliminary results

486
00:30:56,210 --> 00:31:00,720
so that's that's about 100 times faster

487
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,980
but groupies it's quite impressive

488
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,190
if you like following a simplex

489
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:12,920
and actually look through have Courtney
could can use pigment eyes which is the

490
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,330
command line interface to pigments

491
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:18,830
and this pigment RB

492
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:22,199
pigments that pigment prize for authors
cells outs

493
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,000
and goals the pigment place online
through well pigmented

494
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,070
RB in fact that the bison interpreter

495
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:33,810
directly from Ruby and

496
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:39,440
pigments RB is way faster pigment vice

497
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,780
is an example I that it will request a
good

498
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,178
API documentation site I replaced

499
00:31:46,179 --> 00:31:51,720
pigment eyes boy begins gorby undisputed
is amazing

500
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,270
resume in before it took five minutes

501
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:58,418
to compile the site after changing

502
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:01,530
pigment ties to pick things up or be

503
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:04,918
it only takes 20 seconds that is in huge

504
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:09,770
speedo all workers use a different

505
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:12,770
so it's true that ok can be slow

506
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:17,389
most of the time is because don't use
all rights holders

507
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:21,300
and all cases of course in Great Falls

508
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:27,850
right levers is rights Eric

509
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:31,790
I'm mark is not finished have been
working with

510
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:34,928
and all that for few years

511
00:32:34,929 --> 00:32:38,790
keep I think a few years ago I thought
okay no

512
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,668
is finished I'm not going to work with
anymore

513
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:46,169
is a is no work to be done for

514
00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:50,460
but thats oversee no the way things work

515
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,550
there its future work

516
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:58,659
for example improving speed Aikens

517
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:03,030
optimize bit more there and something I
definitely want to investigators

518
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:07,168
this investigate is well as Asian

519
00:33:07,169 --> 00:33:10,660
ass you main Ruby interpreter

520
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:14,250
single roots basically account

521
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:18,570
take voltage of multi-course is a

522
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:22,550
big disadvantages of course there's J
will be no

523
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:26,220
which and rebellious and the boat
supports

524
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:29,250
well multi-threading record this article
isn't so

525
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:33,130
I'm going to investigate maybe for the
next week's

526
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:36,730
amateur I think

527
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:39,970
most people at least to course

528
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:43,440
even for people's mortar

529
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,910
that this is really going to be huge

530
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:53,679
supporting huge sites now look was
designed for web sites that were maybe

531
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,130
fifty

532
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:59,169
or and its pages when a star

533
00:33:59,169 --> 00:34:04,830
its can support up to thousand pages or
two thousand pages this work perfectly

534
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:05,720
fine

535
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,970
for the Folsom outside is I assume

536
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:12,580
mates around a thousand pages maybe some
from

537
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:17,429
experts or and works perfectly but

538
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:22,540
a few months ago somebody opens the
tickets on my ghetto

539
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,980
issue tracker and they say

540
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,639
I have a site with a few 10,000 items

541
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:32,699
an account and we're and

542
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:36,668
those reasons for that was never
anticipated

543
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:40,409
sites but sites that we compile

544
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:44,089
but I to go as a challenge

545
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:48,200
I've been thinking like improve that

546
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:53,469
goal for experiences to make

547
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:56,918
basically girl or through large sites

548
00:34:56,918 --> 00:35:03,919
seven million pages it should be compile

549
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:09,420
it's going to be a challenge as well

550
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:16,420
I'm writing documentation is
surprisingly hard

551
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:19,710
I think there's two levels of writing
the conclusion first of all

552
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:23,620
just document everything make sure the
commission is there

553
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:27,420
is to find okay for the next level is
presenting its

554
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,990
organizing its in really proper way

555
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:35,770
I'm getting there its I'm on the first
level

556
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:39,240
second was still for so if you use now

557
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,009
ok you want to contribute and

558
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:46,300
definitely you know

559
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:50,020
and lastly a couple of

560
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:53,250
point I want to build an active

561
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:57,420
community of contributors

562
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,270
I I think there are quite a few no

563
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:03,470
users but many of them really contribute
much

564
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:07,598
I'm still them the main developer and

565
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,760
don't get me wrong I like doing it of
course but it would be nice if

566
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,420
some more people even if it is just

567
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,849
through like a like who

568
00:36:17,849 --> 00:36:21,920
to brainstorm and checkered use with

569
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:28,059
sign boring us the

570
00:36:28,059 --> 00:36:32,740
I've had this I do you for building a
graphical user interface

571
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:37,410
look for for use now because

572
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:41,190
sometimes people come to me and say okay
I ok through the great

573
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:45,300
but I want to use it for your company
web sites and accountants

574
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:49,190
is going to be updated boy secretaries

575
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:52,460
NPR people: such a and they all speak

576
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,180
is is this possible is a easy way

577
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:00,919
let them do that and there isn't if you
want to use my work then you need to be

578
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,770
able to

579
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:05,920
use a terminal and I do think money

580
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:12,250
your people or UNIX experts so I'm
thinking of building a custom user

581
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,069
interface

582
00:37:13,069 --> 00:37:16,520
like comparable but that is going to be
real stones

583
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:20,950
all and it's going to be local work
somebody

584
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:24,109
to help out there the

585
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:28,890
welcome for

586
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:32,339
to recap works at

587
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:36,690
so excited janitors generators

588
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:40,049
they have really big

589
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:43,160
obvious advantages so that they are

590
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:48,308
false they are secure for easy to deploy
and preview its ok for

591
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:51,349
but they also some advantages which

592
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:55,309
or not this at all all four sides

593
00:37:55,309 --> 00:37:58,569
you think we'll me though they tell

594
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:04,058
okay maybe I should be all obvious ones
lawsuit against your local

595
00:38:04,059 --> 00:38:07,420
power basically free for in beta

596
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:10,839
Kim well-defined compile search for

597
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:14,170
data sources also were without data
sources

598
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:20,309
for them so it wouldn't exist that this
right now because you compile

599
00:38:20,309 --> 00:38:24,480
the site up front you can use checks the
checks

600
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,760
or the its ability HTML CSS and to
release

601
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,819
for and

602
00:38:30,819 --> 00:38:35,029
which as a GS you can turn your website
into an open source project

603
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:39,520
so for example because developer site is
open source you can

604
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,520
you can seat occur

605
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,329
and when you have your own so excited
site

606
00:38:46,329 --> 00:38:49,869
project then you can sure occurred
between

607
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:53,540
others when you can learn from others
this the source code

608
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:57,470
is there an conglomerates with pork
roasts

609
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:01,348
example such and with that

610
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:04,380
I would like to initial

611
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:08,150
so if you think knockers interesting
than you can

612
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:12,740
going to you upside you can currency
good herbal

613
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:17,720
good ripples through and you can you can
find some are sealed you know

614
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,770
feel free to job boy thanks

615
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:28,730
ID any questions

616
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:31,730
I think you mean after using

617
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:35,630
these York

618
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:39,460

621
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:59,899
and and there's there's a through you
once I think I find this

622
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:03,250
31 the ones at those
