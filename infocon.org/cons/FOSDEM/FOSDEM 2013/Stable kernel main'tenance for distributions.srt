1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,980
alone I am a member of the Italian

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,339
colonel team a and and also involved

3
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:12,380
in kernel development upstream and
currently I maintained the

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:19,380
3.2 stable brunch so

5
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,650
server summary of how unstable races

6
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,729
work moments probably mostly nice to
this

7
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,039
to a after every

8
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,980
stable release from the next three
clinics there are

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,449
serious have updates that by

10
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,040
usually by Greg kroah-hartman numbers
for you next on why

11
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,930
and

12
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,280
these will be the these have
cherry-picked bug fixes

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,059
sometimes new hardware support if it
doesn't take a lot of it doesn't take

14
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:57,440
your pick

15
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,030
change to do that and sometimes affect
business trip and Porter

16
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,939
because the can leap years have changed
a

17
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:12,080
and these apace continue at least to win
this race is the next

18
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,170
and makes another release

19
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,560
am

20
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,770
and some versions our users based

21
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:27,070
some Linux versions a I come basis for a
long-term stable branch

22
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:34,070
which can be maintained for several
years assert

23
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,850
how the stable the process works

24
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,030
the mailing list for this the

25
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:46,340
Scott high-traffic sable speaker dock ok

26
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,570
on every commits

27
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:53,020
to the Knicks that has a

28
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,210
CC's to this list in its commitments
each

29
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,880
ends up paying

30
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,500
what is accounted for inclusion in
stable updates

31
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,640
gray transcripts that were all

32
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,399
a a copy those to the list once Louis

33
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,150
has pull the strings and history um

34
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,080
and had also report

35
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,330
did get applied to certain branches

36
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,920
crews I'm of it failed because a

37
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,129
occurred around just the code context
has changed

38
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:32,620
I and

39
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,390
in on contaminates a changed at all to
current stable

40
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,640
updates once it's reached Lynn

41
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,260
mystery as a file in the source tree

42
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,069
documentation slash they will kill rules
to text that explains

43
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:50,238
what the rules are for what's what's
acceptable

44
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,580
from and

45
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,050
very occasionally there regressions
because

46
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,290
some change that apply to a stable
branch didn't really belong where

47
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,359
worship in adjusted it wasn't

48
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,930
otherwise everything has to be a mystery
first

49
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:14,080
so the

50
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,659
maintain a stable branch I am

51
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:21,480
will collect up changes for some period

52
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,170
of weeks and will then

53
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,000
send these out the batch for review
before making the release

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,730
those go to the

55
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,959
mailing list they also gas sensor one
named

56
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:42,690
in the original comments and reviews but
the catch things like

57
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,750
this is needed here because the bike
doesn't exist

58
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,769
or this change isn't going to work if if
you take these other changes that it

59
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:51,620
depends on

60
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,650
I am or

61
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,170
this is this cause regression we parted
mainline

62
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,290
is not yet fixed their in which case

63
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,510
was want to the second fix is available
we can take but it wasn't a stable

64
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,018
branch

65
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:10,349
arm

66
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:14,140
following the review that Lissa changes
money to be revised and then

67
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,519
and maintain it can make a I

68
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,239
comply them to vacate provincie targets

69
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:25,310
hands if it matters not greater
magnitude

70
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,040
pull and he there alleged killer or

71
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,840
so what does this mean for distributions

72
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,630
arm

73
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:45,630
how many people here work on the the
institutions colonel packaging

74
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:52,789
clear was a little bit

75
00:04:52,789 --> 00:04:56,139
okay I am

76
00:04:56,139 --> 00:05:01,529
so I the package maintainer of course
you want to get

77
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:05,039
you want to get back fixes as soon as
possible this affair

78
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,509
important enough for stale updates I am

79
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,999
ands also probably you

80
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:16,689
get back reports directly from who usess
you put

81
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:20,899
stream maybe maybe try to fix its
automated

82
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:25,789
needs to be back ported maybe you can
write fix

83
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:29,119
and stable updates a

84
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:32,509
should be way of showing it showing
those

85
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:38,749
fix between distributions you to you

86
00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:42,520
you to use and fixes to

87
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,948
a do you know make fixes a stable
updates you know what persons

88
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:54,949
yeah so

89
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:03,789
I A 1's added pics but it didn't apply
to the stable kernel because we had

90
00:06:03,789 --> 00:06:04,680
another picture

91
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,319
that was needed for and was it clear how
to

92
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:13,159
fix it up a you know you should with
them

93
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:16,498
on your office to pick

94
00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:19,639
also believe that the didn't invest in
for

95
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:22,869
into it because I'm not really occurred
okay

96
00:06:22,869 --> 00:06:28,740
here

97
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,860
ulcer else who's sexually active in

98
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:38,860
in colonel packaging going

99
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:45,930
I am this is going to be very
interesting tokenism

100
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,600
haven't have more came book response
from the audience

101
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,470
I am so

102
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:56,690
yes for its distribution have

103
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,780
for state releases that no link to
maintain here in a few years

104
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,750
and not fully two or three most
pinkerton releases so

105
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:08,610
to the a that means are you

106
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,430
the long-term stable branches is

107
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:15,650
quite important or useful these

108
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,530
arm past

109
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:24,190
well arm well effect started today

110
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:30,700
61 63 to brunch was used as a basis for

111
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,510
a bunch of long-time supporter
distributions arm

112
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:39,520
and that's it to work out quite well
lots of pictures from

113
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,830
i cant its over 3,500 change when to
approach

114
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:48,690
much about fixes am

115
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:55,180
data has been quite as much are a

116
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,320
they haven't the other long-term
branches that have

117
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,190
test and have been shares between 7-8
distributions

118
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,040
for it because recitals didn't we line
up but also

119
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,740
because that is love maybe they could
have lined up

120
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,060
if we'd actually a talked about all

121
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,230
plans and and

122
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:21,240
the try to settle on a a call on base
version

123
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,419
for releases am

124
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:30,030
so I have no one to us now myself from
my

125
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:34,228
serve myself the I certainly want to be
a long-term stable branch whatever

126
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:35,050
releases

127
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:38,789
which is why I wanted to maintain it the
3.2

128
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:43,260
ponge on term arm

129
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:49,200
and I'm not the only person doing that
sir

130
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,580
a per it's open to

131
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,930
anyone who's involved upstream whose
whose

132
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:02,229
involved in stable prices to take on
whose branches

133
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:06,420
if it's useful for their whatever
they're working on

134
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,709
whether they're into the distribution
all embed its

135
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:16,710
systems or wherever they need a long to
respond

136
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:23,569
cerveza

137
00:09:23,569 --> 00:09:27,679
the the documentation in the current
Austria's kind of the FAQ

138
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:31,329
for stable updates

139
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:38,329
and Wells of questions

140
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:47,140
film

141
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,280
so home often do you expect

142
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,510
was that long terms

143
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:57,140
they do colonel of ok of the mine by
world

144
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:03,160
the a long-term branches and just a
continuation of the usual stable grunge

145
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,199
so whatever so

146
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,550
great will pick one per year and wanna
who

147
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:14,670
wants a long-term anyone who wants a
long-term

148
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:18,849
what I want to know if they were rocked
me long to maintain can wanted to do

149
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,230
that

150
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,590
'em

151
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,800
they want to save it said the they have
to

152
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,620
basing to be so who's he's competent to
do that for

153
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:36,030
you know if your if you are a you're
seeing act actively working upstream

154
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:39,339
plan them

155
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:46,340
he should be okay just

156
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,880
am the number of changes in the
two-point seeps Paul

157
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,870
32 branches pretty impressive means
several commits per day on average

158
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:02,470
which is already locked for a projected

159
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:07,080
in itself and it slowed down quite a bit
recently

160
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,650
butter yeah yeah what do you expect the

161
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:14,150
for the 3.2 we use for wheezy

162
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:19,060
do you expect the a big flow of changes

163
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,349
that who lead to good use age

164
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,240
for this service can only belong to a
more should be.

165
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,410
less used you less useful the cynic

166
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:35,199
quite a high rate of change at the
moment a have

167
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,940
100 also pending for the next race

168
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,840
and that's button clicks therapy if to
to three weeks I think

169
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,940
some

170
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,490
at the moment there are actual or
distributions using 3.2

171
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:57,180
bus mmm thing mostly Debian and Ubuntu
derivatives and I believe ubuntu is a

172
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:57,670
fact

173
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:01,540
source moved 3.5 port because I've

174
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:05,250
hardware no new hardware support which

175
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:09,720
if it an extra arm a troublesome

176
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,550
children is lagging you device id: to a
table there five a stable but quite

177
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:14,920
often

178
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,819
me how to support is going to involve
budding a lot of credit doesn't

179
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,150
doesn't go in answer that's one reason
why

180
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,980
a that's one thing that stable Pakistan

181
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,980
don't cover much distributions coming up
to you or safety from cells

182
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,820
and mister gramm move forward to a new
buddies

183
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,140
because security the Viennese alone with
3.2

184
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:42,580
sorry directly to be an easy loan with
3.2 know connie but his size 3.2

185
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,010
but they are program I believe going to
change I'm

186
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:53,010
in a few months

187
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,120
yes that's the vessel going to change
trend pursuant to remove the LTS to a

188
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:03,810
new coalition

189
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:08,369
with voters over something that susie
has been touring with service packs

190
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:15,370
yeah

191
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:20,620
question on

192
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,920
with the say hardware developers say

193
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,329
design news SEC support should they go
with a stable kernel

194
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:33,810
follow the upstream arm

195
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:37,560
Marshall units are you talking about

196
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,040
headings a tumor development

197
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,939
of the developer has to go into this is
Trey or new don't ask industry-first

198
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:51,149
we talking about something like to what
we would use in a board Support Package

199
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:55,279
your it's just I've seen a lot I mean a
lot of the work I do is we've

200
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,800
vendor supplied bought a lot of them are
taking the long term spawn

201
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,849
putting this stuff on that as a star

202
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:06,879
and inspiring that's their customers and
the questions and not going upstream or

203
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,579
and in some cases stuff doesn't get
upstream in the end

204
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:15,560
them I so stop my last exam this with
the Marvel stuff

205
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:21,229
safe they are finally getting upstream
I've seen several vendors do this with

206
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:24,660
taking a long-term support to colonel
and providing that

207
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,449
their customers this is what you should
use on a hardware

208
00:14:28,449 --> 00:14:32,008
thats

209
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:36,079
yes couldn't not a that's not terrible
but I should be getting the

210
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:43,079
the to really should be getting the
changes upstream as well

211
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,230
and as we are working with some

212
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,520
are mister Cee's and seen some community
because they're

213
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,930
about every winter that really cares
about

214
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:02,439
a.m. getting his his stuff not only so
too

215
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,540
to the industry a think should really go
for the for the main line because

216
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,390
a those those vendor supplied BSP
packages

217
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:13,960
are yes packages tend to be horribly
outdated

218
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:18,290
after a year or so you can reproduce it
you will never get that up

219
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:21,740
upstream and a remember

220
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,890
the most talk from just had a very good
hmm

221
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:29,930
concerning them the mother Sox very said
mother hardest to get

222
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:34,469
their support and mainline and we never
ever even look at their views peace

223
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:37,510
we just read it everything from scratch
because

224
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:41,140
the the vendor be as bizarre out at it
broken whatever

225
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,760
and for me the only way is to

226
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,140
to really stick to upstream and get
things a.m. in one by one

227
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,819
sorry for her

228
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,760
make that not men to

229
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,210
disregard your with your work concerning
the stomach or not

230
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:06,210
same time are innocent man agreement hmm
a

231
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:12,300
so I know there's at least one min to

232
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,500
actually maintains is own stable tree
which is the networking maintainer

233
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,190
to you are not sure freighters good at
home in 10

234
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:23,300
David Miller oh yes yes to you in

235
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,490
I'll so he maintains his own stable key
so his

236
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:29,830
he the don't take responsibility for

237
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:34,320
nominating a networking features that
should go to stable

238
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,790
so so you cannot as write to him on to
know when a timber a million

239
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,939
I is taking a sort of authoritative in
that area

240
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,960
not all any such as to maintain a good
could to

241
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,620
insist on doing that if they wanted
sorry that some is not something that

242
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,770
you welcome as a

243
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:55,250
as an approach does not offload you from
a lot of work or

244
00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:00,030
somewhat your a because he's treating
care about porting

245
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:03,319
that

246
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:10,320
stars doctors take some work of me

247
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:24,819
an email question

248
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:31,819
alright I'm down here

249
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:44,950
okay him

250
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:45,200
yeah
