1
00:00:00,979 --> 00:00:03,929
name is Michael and absent you

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:07,430
more project I've been working on in the
last

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,660
mom the Didier is a to

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,860
a.m. be a delay in on topple

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,490
item fun this just been a few word to
describe you

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,109
which do you for those not on us

7
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:25,650
is a Python library the for making that
analysis

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,788
it of course written in Python

9
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:32,430
leche hoops too early missus

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,030
and

11
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,870
and is based in Mumbai an

12
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,959
it is by dawn are are is a.m.

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,630
very popular but popular the language to
me

14
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,650
that analysis and the

15
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,089
the problem with our is the the tease

16
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,300
very specific I'll so the

17
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,839
item ponders user library to

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,860
most more general-purpose language

19
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,620
to work with if monies paid on are

20
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,840
the the main that the structure is the
data frame

21
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,300
which is basically a.m. to Jenny's
magic's

22
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,979
by the but I find a view

23
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,400
you can hold different data types in
different columns

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,650
and funding to do some improvements

25
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,479
today that the frame which I which is
want to bowl

26
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,679
level indexes and the

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,850
some optimization when working with them
serious

28
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,039
knows

29
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,990
many browsing using fungus good
performance

30
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:46,110
because critical code resiliency so is

31
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,170
it's very fast when

32
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,800
when mi Kim merge operation by operation

33
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,420
and of course a all the numerical

34
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,240
function it as

35
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,490
into intelligent that alignment because
the

36
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:08,649
different column sir are actually holder
in different matter she's

37
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:13,769
each one as its own the type and so that
the alignment his captor

38
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:17,140
consistent bot

39
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,630
is still quite hard to explain to
someone who's not a computer scientist

40
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:26,220
someone was not a computer science
background how to efficiently work

41
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,840
we do such to so use

42
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,290
as mall vicious cycle that is I found
myself in

43
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,400
the those that are interested in making
data analysis

44
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,390
you really don't know what to do dunno
how to make that announces

45
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,399
and these are Journal Easter the

46
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,610
company managers and such so

47
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,290
the they the Oscar DC could traditions

48
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,400
to make that analysis but additions
usually

49
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,120
don't have the right tools to do to do
so and they have 2s computer scientist

50
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,720
to out them

51
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,780
if the communication cables

52
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,410
this is the result with the nice but

53
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,859
week show was the question you actually
happened to me

54
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,220
so the goal was to a

55
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,800
build a.m. layer on top of fund us

56
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,900
to make teeing easier and to make steam
mark

57
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,590
scalable and reproductive UL are

58
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,640
what do you have to do we have to

59
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,760
define which the columns

60
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,129
you know that the frames should be used
as dimensions

61
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:42,190
which columns

62
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:46,050
are calculated the from a other columns

63
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:50,239
and the introducers a do what I mean
behavior

64
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,640
in some function the specifically

65
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,129
%um merging operations and the negation
sting operation

66
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:01,980
reach it we call roll up down

67
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,238
there are some statistical functions
mainly use it with time serious

68
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,750
the that are wat always the same

69
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,019
even though they are quite complex to
implement to the

70
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:19,320
to some someone was not the a computer
science background and finally

71
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,169
Reza no need to all the over that
analysis

72
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:27,010
if we cannot produce a some rappers
ovett if we cannot present at the

73
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,820
resulting in a human readable way

74
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,590
so a

75
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,400
the project consists basically

76
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,200
in a emitted meta data structure around
a

77
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,070
funds that the frame a these metadata
described what I just said the

78
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,690
so gives a a role 22 each column other
data frame

79
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,190
and the

80
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,490
them an engine try to the

81
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,810
to find out to what to exactly

82
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,280
the the user want to do we did

83
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,179
so disease

84
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,010
the basically a the first step for

85
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,110
to use a to use them star

86
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:18,480
the would fun us they can load the data
from many different type Alba

87
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,420
of Iowa's or that amazing do you just
one case from issues

88
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,350
by banner I A Porter mind that the frame

89
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,590
inside a star object and this

90
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:34,359
darker surf a marker ardor and

91
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,090
defaulter meta-data or I can pass him
into data structure that I

92
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:44,450
have built before admitted it is
basically

93
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:48,420
the is built the with the bite and
dictionaries

94
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,430
and in a dictionary

95
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:55,220
edge drive type of columns sold a
mentions which can be used

96
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,050
and bite on indexes but be used in don't
know anything about D's

97
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,640
soul the system just define the index is
a

98
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,740
were when is the right time to do it
unwary column

99
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,490
well that's quite obvious the you table
values

100
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,970
are labels or other values that are

101
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:19,550
always the same for a specific dimension
and finally

102
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,130
celebration and operations are columns
that are calculated to

103
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:28,870
like as function of other columns and
the

104
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,939
when I do barter further

105
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:36,120
them elaboration on on

106
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,330
role data D's must not be messed up

107
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,449
so they should be reevaluated

108
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:47,330
when the regional it to changes just

109
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:52,609
just a basic idea behind the mansions a
it's a typical

110
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,770
the star structure which data

111
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:00,539
are in the center and the day mansions

112
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:04,068
definitions and levels are Lincoln
together

113
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:07,360
in a star shape the

114
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,250
typically disease used for addition

115
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,810
operation and that to change ur level

116
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,180
lemme did you go Kazu CD country in
region

117
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,180
which can be easily reach the weeds

118
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,289
just one functional operation

119
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:32,460
%um ponders as he said the a new column
can be defined

120
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,489
as a functional other columns just just
america example

121
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,969
an with star the same seeing

122
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:43,190
is the final with a slightly different a
syntax

123
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,879
the with done the system

124
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,960
how the column should be the

125
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:55,120
evaluated every time do regional values
changes or a

126
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,570
when I do a gaysian that the

127
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:03,620
niches these values and

128
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,980
finally there is a small reporting
engine a

129
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,370
do they're pretty Nanjing let you define
templates in

130
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:14,400
not text or HTML the

131
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,489
we living placeholders for data
representation that they can be

132
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:21,700
represented in tabular farm or graph

133
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:27,650
and the the reason the project due to
build an automatic stay EXR

134
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:32,620
generator Ross

135
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:37,330
particularly an interesting because air

136
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:42,630
I tried to leave space bill and more
module based on my plate lieber

137
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:46,530
Emily different types of graphs by now
there are just

138
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,620
simple typographical like a the

139
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,020
simple plots the bar graph sir and

140
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,290
and scatter but more can be added quite
easily

141
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:02,000
if you if you know month Libya a

142
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,670
diseases the the basic use age

143
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,240
you call is if items creeped

144
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,010
star reporting engine call in a folder
containing

145
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:17,150
both the template la tech or

146
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,390
HTML and data informal

147
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,550
item pickles so are you savor your

148
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,890
your object co-star objectors by 10
people in a

149
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:29,900
in a folder and you can easily produce

150
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,360
forever or if you can or if you want to

151
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,620
produce multiple reports we do for enter
but the senator

152
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,080
but all with the same a template

153
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,510
you can just a concession API above

154
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:51,240
this the star reporting engine what

155
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,450
to I want to do from here first the wall

156
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,490
has had the the automated text generator

157
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:00,690
should be implemented maybe

158
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,410
using Nishiki to learn or some other
machine learning tools

159
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:08,540
I actually don't know and more plotter

160
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,230
much more plotters the invalided

161
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,360
record handling which is quite the same
thing that

162
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,400
evaluated columns but that should work
song record instead of columns

163
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,939
