1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,469
hello everyone our next speaker is

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:07,350
time and then it's and he's going to
talk about how application developers

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,170
can improve their security

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:16,170
using the that attack proxy I hope

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,880
can you hear me OK yeah

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,099
okay right I my name is Simon it

7
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:30,760
and on his talk told you about I'm using
your

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,540
that attack proxy otherwise known as
that and how you can use it

9
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,879
optically within development and kill a
functional testing

10
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:42,440
up before I get started I've got a
couple questions feed I

11
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,980
first one is up if anyone here heard
about what

12
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,398
before this weekend for coming here of
pretty good

13
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:54,719
a anyone heard of that before this
weekend

14
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,840
a few good and you want to use that

15
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,449
not very many I could not find

16
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:05,939
that's what I was expecting so I don't
have to just not talk too much

17
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:10,360
her but if you go any questions in
Chatham out now or I will estimate that

18
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,630
at the end okay so

19
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:18,289
my son but its honey said attack proxies
that project Lee

20
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,439
and I worked for me villa in that
security

21
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,529
2012 isn't gonna give you

22
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,020
on a very brief overview assuming you
know nothing at all about it

23
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,700
which is the case in for most people
then I'm gonna give a demo

24
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,490
I and after that I'll talk a bit more
about up

25
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,110
some the functionality for them you good
to them I know it's

26
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:46,280
dangerous to do life but help so it
starts off with

27
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,270
the obvious question which is what is up
and it is a tool for finding

28
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,339
vulnerabilities

29
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,770
in web applications so even not interest
in the security web applications then

30
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:00,039
you probably in the wrong talk it is so
it's

31
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,259
talk hoping penetration tests on I

32
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,409
the what are the main things is a
wonderful turkey things is

33
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:12,940
it's easy to use atomic as easy to use
as possible it is obviously completely

34
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,150
free and open source

35
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:19,200
otherwise they won't let me in here and
know what flagship project

36
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,810
so quite a few you heard about what
someone you haven't

37
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,910
30 open web application security project
with gotta stand

38
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:31,010
I will come on when I'm not here I'm so
if you want to learn more please come

39
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,268
over and say hi to a swing tell you all
about it

40
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:36,470
up there are quite a few I was project
so things like

41
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,580
top 10 I'm which is the top 10
vulnerability a

42
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:44,879
risks in web applications for their the
hole in a project summer more mature

43
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,450
than others

44
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,480
and a small set a flagship project
including the top 10

45
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,420
including zap and the project which
considered to be the most mature

46
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,690
and the most the ones you should really
look at first

47
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,099
and it is ideal for beginners

48
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:03,659
I'm not that's a very that's a good
reason for that

49
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:08,230
don't really consider myself bi security
expert my background is in development

50
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,709
I started playing around with that as a
way to teach myself

51
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:15,879
about security I realized I didn't know
enough I want to learn more

52
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:20,109
and the only way I'm really learn is by
cutting code so I started cutting code

53
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,440
circling around with things and I
started talking to other people who like

54
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,599
up work with on

55
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,609
realizing they did known about security
stop giving security talks

56
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,750
and to develop a functional testers and

57
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,090
one of those questions I got asked by
developers and Q eight people this

58
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,459
what tools we use Chris developers we
like tools that way

59
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:44,500
yes yes we did I'm still on the ground

60
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,700
and on what I wanted to know what to
recommend toll

61
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,579
which worth effective and easy to use
and free and open source

62
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,890
I looked around and I couldn't find
anything I look thought was suitable

63
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,929
but closest thing I found with on

64
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,290
a to call para Paris proxy that only
used it

65
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,250
I'm its really nice little tool

66
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,400
problems I hadn't been updated for years
I so it's very up to date

67
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,720
was written in Java quite simple so I
stopped playing around with it

68
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,120
teach myself and some things that
annoyed me it wasn't doing things I

69
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,759
started

70
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:20,900
developing myself for the coding thanks
Charlie changing it I now realise

71
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:24,330
but this was actually the closest told
that although I would like to recommend

72
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,340
to other developers so a full power of

73
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,539
and treated as an attack proxy so the
its

74
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,040
always been a focus for me to be aimed
at beginners and people who are

75
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,699
newt replication security however the
thing that really surprise me

76
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:44,040
is that think the security professionals
who took it up first

77
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,070
and this was not what I intended a I
think exciting

78
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:52,169
think that I could actually right to to
look confessional and just as we use

79
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:52,710
because I think

80
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:57,669
books I certainly wasn't one I am now up
to work with the security team so I am

81
00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:01,060
both cutie professional Amber Alert
using a lot of professional

82
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,250
askew team to using it so it goes from
the whole range from

83
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,639
from beginner right up special so it's
actually really good

84
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:10,680
talk to learn with you can teach
yourself and you can actually start

85
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:17,400
using more features as you learn more
about security

86
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,948
but I still wanna my focus is to make
sure that it's

87
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:24,400
really ideal for developers and
functional testers among other things

88
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,448
I'm really keen on

89
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:29,340
is automated security testing and that
some things are something on the talk

90
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,679
about later

91
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,680
I'm building it is becoming a framework
for both testing

92
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,620
so they'll there's a lot of things you
can do I think you can actually carry on

93
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,830
due to very sophisticated things is
gonna get more space to get as time goes

94
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,240
on

95
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:50,240
we're still gonna try make sure easy
issues as possible

96
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:56,330
so few the principles behind that up
mention free and open source

97
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:01,060
us that's very important to me up and
involving is very actively encouraged

98
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,389
they're quite a few to open source
project which are

99
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:08,280
very tightly controlled by one
individual or company

100
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,940
on a problem with that if you release
code is open source and how you manage

101
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,669
it is entirely up to you

102
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:16,859
but I do think the powerful open-source
really comes from

103
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,000
when anybody can contribute anyone can
get involved

104
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,150
and takin a interactions that a

105
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:27,770
the original might not expect so always
said that that is a community-oriented

106
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:28,930
project

107
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,180
it's very easy to get involved in anyone
he wants to get involved please do

108
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,900
just contribute some diesen code and
looking to commit access

109
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,150
it's that easy so a lot of my time is
spent trying to make sure

110
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,560
the people can contribute and help
people come to to contribute

111
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,610
it takes me an hour to help somebody
could

112
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,900
brought to feature I could do in half an
hour I will take that our

113
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:56,900
to make sure because then personal learn
something hopefully contribute more

114
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:01,620
and its cross-platform is written in
Java so some JVM

115
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,729
Daniel run %uh no job it's got a bad rap
for the moment

116
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:08,190
but thats job in the browser John from
service on another

117
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:12,740
as a platform is is OK trust me

118
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,410
easy to use this is something that is
still very important to me

119
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,830
I want to easy to use one because it's
aimed at beginners partly and to begin

120
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,840
this anyway

121
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,090
real thing is I don't like to lose it
difficult to use I want tolls

122
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:29,060
the intuitive and do what I want to do
what I want to know why or what to do

123
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:33,500
that to do things so easy to use is
important to realize that developers

124
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,050
even if they start using that one should
be anyway cuz otherwise to be

125
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,060
executed were so should be is picking up
occasionally

126
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,970
so should be as easy as possible to get
are ok but I do only I remember this

127
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,120
should be intuitive and straightforward
and

128
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,520
one thing we do is if you have problems
you can rate them is that your

129
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,128
eat abuse problems you can raise some
issues we treat those just as serious a

130
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:55,069
functional

131
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:59,009
issues so we can use is very important
to us

132
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:03,400
and it's easy to install I to install
quite a few a lot on

133
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,489
open source security told some other a
complete nightmare

134
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,720
so many dependencies and think and it's
something to be very difficult to get

135
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,430
working

136
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:17,220
won't go up Java 7 JVM Solyndra

137
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,800
and it isn't a nationalized I on it's
always the price a number of client

138
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,610
programs

139
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:26,389
which are only available in English at
the seams result in me

140
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:30,110
I my background him a subside about the
web development

141
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,010
and I just couldn't bear putting
hardcoded strings in the code

142
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,458
first of internationalizing sup I was
written writing and that is what back

143
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:38,029
and

144
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:42,149
internationally all Carrasco zack is now
complete internationalized

145
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:45,700
and it's been translated into thirteen
other languages now

146
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,910
we scrapping dot com which is free for
open source project

147
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,550
is great so anyone can get involved you
would like to help the translational

148
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,910
translate to a new language and just get
in touch

149
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,939
and and you know you've just you don't
have to be not finishing just get stuck

150
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,700
in

151
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,060
and it is fully documented at 10 things
I cannot

152
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:09,880
evaluate a lot of on open source project
my first things I do with I look at

153
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:15,209
the plantation I don't actual to read it
someone tito to intuitively diffuse

154
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:18,819
I don't know the documentation is there
because you know the tall is actually

155
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,800
good in youthful

156
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,569
but he always stop pushing the
boundaries it's good to know that you

157
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,450
can actually

158
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,920
there is documentation documentation
pretty much every feature in that

159
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,110
I'm not gonna claim is the best
documentation every in a with developers

160
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,420
we write yourself

161
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,510
but you know if you have any problems
let us know we'll try and

162
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:41,510
explain things or prove that
documentation

163
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,089
it also works well with other told so
it's very important a major

164
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:49,589
to make sure that that plays well with
by nope that

165
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,700
its part to the its racially poppins
infrastructural

166
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,870
I want to be able to make sure that it
can fit in with other told the

167
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,860
specialized vertical

168
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,100
thing that'll never be everything to
everybody everyone it's got a purpose

169
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,890
and I don't deviate too far from that so
want to make sure that works hotel

170
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,649
security tools other developer tools

171
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:12,899
and reuse is another thing which i think
is very important a

172
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:16,670
I'm doesn't get you very much in
security tools which surprised me when I

173
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,829
started looking at them

174
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:21,279
so wherever possible we try and reuse
well-regarded libros take the security

175
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,240
lobbyist

176
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,360
rather reinvention will every time

177
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,399
so why is that up

178
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:35,300
basically if you write web applications
anyone here on web application

179
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,170
pulling my dick right it that on the
internet

180
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:42,790
they will be attacked if they on an
Internet

181
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:46,430
will be attacked as well people who are
attacking your applications

182
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,640
every day old all day

183
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,610
and the question is who will find upon
abilities it is really difficult to

184
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:54,300
write

185
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,670
good book fully functional web
applications have no vulnerabilities

186
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,719
you have a look at the number below the
belt is found in very well-known website

187
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,700
yet and that the website I'll
applications

188
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,230
have companies who have the best
developers going

189
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:14,010
sewing use of Twitter and things like
that you know it is really hard to write

190
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,660
applications with no possibilities

191
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,490
so the question is who is gonna find
them and it could be

192
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:23,350
a security researcher which is good on
the telly give me some warning

193
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,540
I mean what made you get some pent up to
them but if you're rocking open source

194
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,490
software you for becoming 48 and test
isn't or it could be the bad guy

195
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,339
which is a course the worst-case
best-case is that you find them and you

196
00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:35,010
find them

197
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:38,100
early

198
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,140
and finding things early is really K
because

199
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:46,269
if you do get I me you actually get
contest today typically you get the main

200
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:49,529
you know a week or two weeks for your
life and if they find

201
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:53,329
serious problems the do you go like with
those older do you actually

202
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:56,359
then rework it and put it yet delay or

203
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,930
and go live date which is up the could
cost your company money or

204
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:03,800
what ok to make a much more harder for
you to do business whereas

205
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,139
on because the worst cases actually
finding vulnerabilities applications

206
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:08,120
gonna like city

207
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,610
compromised uses get compromised the
best thing to do is find the probability

208
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,180
ideal ideally in development thing
actually

209
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,339
find them and find out the cause fix
them as soon as possible

210
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:23,420
before you have to me more for both say
thank God

211
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,490
and this may be a little bit
controversial but I think attacking

212
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:29,029
applications actually does make you
better develop

213
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:33,070
I'm kinda launched another but I started
looking penetration testing

214
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:36,490
teach myself about what the attackers
would do

215
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:40,639
I believe you can't right secure
software unless you know how it's going

216
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,750
to be attacked

217
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:48,139
and talk like that can help you find
that out

218
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:53,089
right not for the risk it

219
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:56,880
so what do I do you think a vulnerable
web application

220
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,990
its cool about it still it's free and
open source it on Google Code

221
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,769
so it's an application I wrote a few
years ago and Fort

222
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:08,680
for a course I was running on security

223
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,329
and of course I'm using the that attack
proxy

224
00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:16,959
so that's what it looks like so we have
a

225
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,709
we will eat fat a new version of that
2.0 10

226
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:24,920
this week just Wednesday gone a wants to
get out before this conference

227
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,040
and so is very deliberate timing I'm
says would look fine Advani you fit seen

228
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,689
it before

229
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:33,200
what I think you'll notice which
different is this new Quick stopped ap

230
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,410
so that is obviously aimed at people

231
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,610
and hood relatively new to security

232
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,170
I'm what you can do if you can just type
in the URL

233
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:50,170
the you want to attack look they've
already got in there

234
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,389
the first attack not a straightforward
now

235
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:56,690
what you'll see it done very quickly
that the first thing it does

236
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,269
is its fighters the application takes
the URL

237
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:03,769
the F-twenty and it accesses that URL

238
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:07,800
that choice find all links uncapped and
cruel your website from that

239
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,060
find as much about what such as possible

240
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,489
and then it does the attacking so it's
actually did doing now

241
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:17,620
is active scanning this is the real
attacks

242
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,680
will send a passive scanning so one
you're browsing proxying through that

243
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,469
or spy drink were actually looking at
all the question responses to see

244
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,329
whether there are things we could
problems we can text just looking at the

245
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:32,459
the request responses a certain type of
attacks

246
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:35,969
things like process scripting and SQL
injection

247
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,290
you can only find really fine if you
actually do attacked and this is what

248
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:42,300
that have been doing just now one thing
I should stress

249
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,829
is that you should only do the sort of
test

250
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:50,859
on applications that we their own we've
been given permission to attack

251
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,449
otherwise you breaking the law alright
told you not to do it

252
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:59,569
okay that's my get out of jail free card

253
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:03,279
so happens now started the application

254
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,399
honest on for attacks I will see down
here

255
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,519
the whole set on alert

256
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,620
so let's all vulnerabilities a potential
vulnerabilities

257
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,120
I think potential vulnerabilities
because we'll we're all to making this

258
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,510
the

259
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:20,010
and so you can let you know it's always
with double checking so have a look down

260
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:20,910
here

261
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:25,519
we have a cross-site scripting
portability

262
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,839
and if you double click on the things
you actually get a

263
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:32,130
probably lose more information so it'll
actually tell you

264
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,459
give you a full description all what
they think what the

265
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:39,000
vulnerability is and a solution as well
and that you get

266
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,100
web run HTML XML reports out this as
well

267
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,600
but we can see each you can see the
request and you can see the response

268
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,720
I'm with she got here highlighted is the

269
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,240
the evidence that the sack include see
quite clearly are being able to inject a

270
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,089
script

271
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:59,940
and you can open that in a brown still
get a popup so that is proof that we

272
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,779
actually have

273
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:07,779
a vulnerability in this application

274
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,849
so what I recommend is that you can

275
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:16,410
to get started got a very quick option
you can actually just go to a quick stop

276
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:21,560
put in your URL attacking is enough for
you

277
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:26,069
okay so it it was a the economy into the
talk

278
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:30,310
and it's never that easy application
security quite tricky

279
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:34,670
a it's very tricky back and there are
some limitations

280
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,380
an obvious one if you've got a look in
page hopefully that will be able to

281
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,839
login quite so simply

282
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,839
so you in touch see any the application
at all and the other thing is

283
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,079
the spider up is effective but it it
could always better

284
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,649
be better so I don't make too tall never
understand the context what is looking

285
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:53,180
for

286
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,979
amman is actually doing so it will
supply

287
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,389
dummy values which typically means you
want to explore

288
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:04,569
application fully an obvious thing is
where you have to register user

289
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:08,250
you'll see a form and you put Fredette

290
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,559
and the on that'll put in 123 whatever
does

291
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,649
and you get an error message back saying
this must be an email address

292
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,650
you go okay be an email address Fredette
gmail.com

293
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:22,520
fine and then you you registered whereas
that would just go

294
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,980
but nothing kind of interesting back to
move on so

295
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,150
it's not be much more effective to up

296
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:33,270
have a person exploring application

297
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:36,549
so when you actually do the penetration
testers cute rational

298
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:41,639
or in only two issue your browser any
proxy got through to like that

299
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,240
and explore the application and that's
very that's good from

300
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,650
point of view that you actually you
start learning about the application as

301
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,200
well

302
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,330
but you're also essentially taking that
how to drive application

303
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,830
annual XP will be able to explore much
more the application then you run the

304
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,010
automated toll

305
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:02,490
a the attacking and then you can start
doing the manual test

306
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:06,070
I'm us all well and good I'm you can't
as developing to that and up

307
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:09,820
I've with the Q eighteen to force that
will you know yet estimating manually

308
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,020
what it actually his proxy through that
yielding

309
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,629
explore the official much more
effectively and then do not make it

310
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:20,780
attacking which is great but the
developer this take some time

311
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:24,690
and its its manual it's not bright

312
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:30,240
so just take a little diversion

313
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,440
also quite refreshing test

314
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,910
as a developer on a big fan a regression
test

315
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:42,070
officially text that you haven't messed
things up you can say right direction

316
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,668
with depression has surpassed

317
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:47,660
bullshit are you doing it gunna Dickson
manual test as well use insanity checks

318
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,480
but if the regression test past legal
good set a regression test

319
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,520
then up you have at least some warm
feeling they have really messed up

320
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,179
and if you're dealing with web
applications it's a fairly

321
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:03,820
that a good way of testing them out and
you could have something like a built

322
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,309
all

323
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,590
where this Jenkins or until May vernal
anything like that

324
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:11,409
driving someday unlike selenium Troy in
your browser

325
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:16,360
which drives the web application unit
test as well be unit test test test

326
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,530
small hot where something like selenium

327
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:22,530
is actually testing the application that
the user sees

328
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,889
is no credible individual bits work but
the whole thing is broken

329
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:29,240
you want to make sure that the what the
user is actually seeing

330
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:35,270
works properly so if anyone he got that
sort of setup

331
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,270
few the right that's good and this is a
really great way of doing

332
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:42,110
functional testing it's good because
developers were writing the things you a

333
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,520
people writing these things

334
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,020
understand the application understand
what it should be doing what I should be

335
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,510
doing

336
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:51,840
so a lot of people have the sort a
functional test

337
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,030
will be really great is we have security
Russian test

338
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:59,299
now these a much harder actually very
hard to write

339
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:02,350
and ticket developers and capable of
though

340
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:06,209
understaffed arrow you don't specialize
in security don't really understand it

341
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:10,120
a bowl be really great it if we can
actually magically change these

342
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,219
regression test

343
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,200
and your precious into security test

344
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,559
and my suggestion is what you can do is
you can

345
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:23,428
proxy so selenium driving

346
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:26,669
your browser choice which of course if I
hope up

347
00:20:26,669 --> 00:20:30,309
through that so something it now doing

348
00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:33,559
is you are exploring your application

349
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:36,690
using these texts for your teachings
that how

350
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:41,330
the application works have should be
driven so explore think

351
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:45,059
and then we can do if you get your bill
tool talk directly to that

352
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:48,178
because we have a REST API and

353
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:51,419
so you can actually kickoff things like
the spider and the

354
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:55,440
actress Kamna and then get the bomber
details the Bonneville it is back

355
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,650
taken run your you the test

356
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:03,100
and then run your security test

357
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:08,250
and I'll hopefully you a dip

358
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:15,250
first boo oil believe this

359
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:26,850
so I have here is a eclipse for me

360
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:31,939
onto going to do is kick off

361
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:38,940
a set of function functional Selenium
tests this is the interesting that way

362
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,020
just wait and saving up

363
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:44,920
and something happening I'm feeling
relieved already so

364
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:49,080
what we're doing now is selenium is
driving the browser

365
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,330
which for hopefully is prompting through
that and

366
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:57,480
so essentially what you're doing is
you're converting functional test into

367
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,950
security test I'm what I'm doing

368
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:03,000
part much of Mithila is we are

369
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,120
putting this in place so I'm working
with the Q eighteen

370
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,500
Q eighteen here day iraq

371
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,180
so on yeah he's other so i'm looking

372
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,820
the Pacific Q eighteen so actually

373
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:20,340
in betting this to making sure but what
we doing is

374
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,429
having all the functional test going all
like through

375
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:27,270
and but we just gone through that the
council test worked

376
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:30,870
and but the security test fail

377
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:37,870
so Voice scroll up to even read this or
not we have

378
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,080
protests run run their successfully with
and picked off

379
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,689
the spider and hold the state as long

380
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:54,770
and then kicked off the active gonna

381
00:22:54,770 --> 00:23:00,020
and popular so

382
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:04,879
again we can see good history page all
history come through their

383
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,930
and the other we have a whole set up
alerts now so the idea

384
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:16,620
is you can actually put include this is
part of your continuous integration so

385
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,209
you check some code in at a maybe

386
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:23,430
you know you for you forget to escape
something or something you on your

387
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,100
project

388
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,459
who doesn't understand how this would
work and you forget to

389
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:32,240
you respect forget to escape a from user
input when you reflect a

390
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,490
when you put it back out onto the
two-page and and a few hours after you

391
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:37,330
check out in

392
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:41,290
your functional tests run they get
prompted through that back from the

393
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,350
whole attack site

394
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:45,399
and you get an e-mail alert to say that
you've now got a cross-site scripting

395
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,640
vulnerability in your application

396
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,830
hours after you actually check the code
in

397
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:57,830
as opposed to after its gone life water
will do now

398
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:08,140
is quickly what so

399
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:12,220
that passes REST API and

400
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:16,540
okay it could be better document we have
some documentation

401
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:20,280
one thing we do have is whether you are
around it and for this is

402
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,930
automatically generated and you can
explore different components soaking up

403
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,550
a look at things like the coal

404
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:30,409
and these are all the think you can look
at so let's have a look

405
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:34,520
the alert and

406
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,830
I'll just have first

407
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:41,199
to alert

408
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,830
exiles

409
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:49,100
probably easier and so that URL

410
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:53,090
is the one you like you can actually use
so this show issue

411
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:56,610
all the operations are available at
Conseco actually try it out

412
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:59,639
on manually before we actually have to
go in

413
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,890
and on drive it programmatically

414
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:06,560
we have got documentation online as well
but

415
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,840
browsing at that was probably the
easiest way we also have

416
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,709
I Java and Python libraries so those get
off at the generated as well

417
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:18,730
a few actually like a any other client
libraries and get in touch

418
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:22,090
if you can actually write the you know a
simple cut test case

419
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:26,159
with one operation but I'm probably
getting generate the code for all the

420
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,560
others

421
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,129
it is much easier generation the code
for these things rather not have to

422
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:30,970
write the money like

423
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:37,430
I'd like making things easy myself at

424
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:42,130
loads more information online about this
%uh

425
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:46,220
now that what what showed you

426
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,860
looks very straightforward very easy but
try to get embedded

427
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,280
and get it working well a is non-trivial

428
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,410
a lot of people a working on this right
now from working with a lot of other

429
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:57,190
companies

430
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:01,240
what you doing this to so if you want do
this kind of thing at your company or

431
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,550
when you open source project and get in
touch with me I don't think just try it

432
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:04,860
out

433
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,990
the please get in touch on because
obviously

434
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:10,730
we've got some experience in this and
also you gonna come up with new ideas

435
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,260
any suggestions

436
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:15,540
and I can implement them or can help you
to implement them

437
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:22,540
which is even better from my point of
view

438
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:28,260
so what talk to def talk to you about
now is from the main features

439
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:32,670
of that infecting proxy this is where it
started out

440
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:37,690
so the typical late you speak I'm used
in ways using security teams

441
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,820
a few tell your browser to proxy through
that

442
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:44,770
and then you can say observes that can
see everything

443
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:48,420
the you can see their quest responses
and you can intercept them you can

444
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,410
change them

445
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:52,520
and you got a lot done a whole lotta on
tools and you can fuck

446
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,340
things and do lots of interesting things
let's go active and passive

447
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:00,490
scanners so the passive scanner just
looks to the quest responses

448
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:05,140
works out whether Eureka certain things
you can tell you haven't got

449
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:09,880
said head is in place or you have a

450
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,390
think that you know you know putting
HTTP only on the cookies things like

451
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,440
that which we can to look just look at
the code

452
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,100
the HTML ago your body will simple on
ability

453
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,830
up the active scanner that's the one
docket attacking

454
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:25,889
on so again don't use that on an
application the pub on Hwy 101

455
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:29,220
to the permissions test it's got

456
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,750
walk or traditional spider a I'm not the
one you saw very briefly earlier

457
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,900
so it goes examines all the links and
just keeps on

458
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,960
on following those links finding all
look different

459
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,680
a areas your application this is good
this really fast

460
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,870
but is not so effective if you got an
application use a lot of

461
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:51,189
Ajax for Lotte JavaScript then

462
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:54,830
it can it can have problems you have a
generating links for JavaScript

463
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:58,500
traditional fighters have a lot of
problems with that so what we've done

464
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,900
is we've now gone you a check spider
what that does

465
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,480
is it actually again uses selenium to
drive the browser

466
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,250
an annex fines on them that music eyes
of using a particle called tax

467
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:14,510
and so the actual explores the
application based on the links generated

468
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:17,780
for your browser for as long as you
actually got things to click on and

469
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,480
hopefully of location has a voice-over
useful one

470
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,540
up then that will explore that will find
that all that content

471
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:28,690
save going to Jax application that the a
jet fighters say

472
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,800
I do you want to use for that the
reasons I don't use all the times that

473
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,879
much lower

474
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,580
gonna see it you know it with got a
browser that s

475
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,800
essentially clicking on things getting
responses back whereas the traditional

476
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,020
far as much faster

477
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:46,590
also the WebSocket support they don't
pay using WebSockets

478
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:50,060
few right one thing I lifestyle youth

479
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:53,649
that sometimes as a debugging tool just
when developing things

480
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,890
is really useful if you've got a some

481
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:00,260
the library a tax on livor you want to
see what's going on

482
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:04,129
what the question response till or maybe
made a mistake you want to

483
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:08,550
change summit how the application work
to change some the promise being sent

484
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:12,060
you can do on the flight is that they
can use that the debugging tool

485
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,940
if you doing web using WebSockets you
merely need to use that

486
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:20,270
I think that's got the best a WebSocket
supportive any security tool

487
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:24,420
open source or commercial we have on the
Google Summer code guys over that last

488
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:24,910
summer

489
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:28,410
implemented this so you like you can in
fact you can see all the WebSocket

490
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,510
communications

491
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:33,540
you can intercept them taken changed on
the fly you can send you want

492
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,700
in even faster and so if you do any work
stoppage for

493
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,760
to check out the to play without I got a
problem

494
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,900
let us know force browsing so this is
where

495
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,920
you developer sometimes trade URL's that

496
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,930
matter how many links to them so think
that the bad guys won't find them

497
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:53,010
I'm the bad guys can because they you
stole things but

498
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:57,720
what oster buster which is a which
that's for sprouting destroy slow to

499
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,500
lift though the permutations

500
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,000
so again paltry used to using the device
to code up

501
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,660
and at the library so we can do so you
can actually

502
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:10,730
falling pretty much any URL have a
well-hidden this

503
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:13,790
I'm your footing as well and in fact
terms built

504
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:17,060
the automated scanner that the active
scanner does

505
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:20,550
targeted attacks and looks for
particular touched upon abilities

506
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:24,270
we know that sometimes you can find all
the possibilities that way

507
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:28,050
and so that fucking you can actually
choose what you can know

508
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:31,340
attack and how you can attack it with
different fussing libros

509
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:34,980
but probably more the security folk up
but you know

510
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,840
if you're if you're really came on as
developers well with playing around with

511
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:43,000
and the other key thing above the big
changes in the Richard just got out

512
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,370
is this online I don't marketplace no
idea about the idea of an online

513
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:50,500
Adams marketplace from but the idea is

514
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,040
you but I'm trying to make it as easy as
possible to extend

515
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,220
happen for anyone can to contribute to
it among the waist

516
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:02,300
is by creating Adams will host those and
he got he looked on a beacon

517
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,919
see what that you can browse them from
within that download and install them

518
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:12,250
dynamically

519
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:15,770
as you wanna be up things is all attacks
we using for the active and passive

520
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:16,480
scanning

521
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,580
are implemented as an ALMS of course you
can download them

522
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,710
I'm you cannot update those
automatically which is

523
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:25,910
can be useful if you're skinny person
but if you've got

524
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:28,790
that was part of your continuous
integration you can actually download

525
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,470
the latest plugins

526
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:33,800
before you run your tests automatically
and that means

527
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,169
you might come in one morning and you
have to change the code

528
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:40,690
but we've improved some the tax audit
new ones than it actually

529
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,870
told about vulnerability you did not you
can actually know you

530
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:47,800
at and I've been up in the code for some
time to because we got new tax

531
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:53,629
you able that they will now find

532
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:57,170
okay some pictures i dont the hallways

533
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:00,260
simply aimed at developers the ones
which are

534
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:03,850
may well be of use to you this quick
stopped after I mentioned earlier

535
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:07,060
showed you earlier that nice n Easy his
gurl

536
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:10,120
go attack it the REST API

537
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,409
up some security people using as well to
interact with other security tools

538
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:16,440
but really one entree to this I was
thinking mostly about

539
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,010
develop thank you I and integrating
within a

540
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:23,270
continuous integration by parts of the
real dubs initial focus on it

541
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:26,320
and week extended the REST API in 20

542
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,370
0 so the fact you the whole lotta
functionality

543
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:32,909
she drive by the site my plan is to get
it to actually

544
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:36,270
you can do pretty much anything by the
API as well

545
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:40,070
said we don't chill from Python client
coming if you or any other language

546
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,700
oversee just use the eight players

547
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:46,740
ATI's directly a and we spoke with Jason
XML yes change something in the URL and

548
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,250
Q

549
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:50,530
both supported but up to the clutch make
it easy some people

550
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:53,670
and if that if you want any other
language supported any other scripting

551
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:54,240
languages

552
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,350
money online let me know headless mode

553
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:01,129
that publicist also offers palace was

554
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:04,270
just to you on but with that now for the
demon mode

555
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:08,310
so do you actually running this on a
continuous integration server

556
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:12,440
don't have you know don't have it the

557
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,690
screen connected to I think and yes you
know you're using all

558
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:18,830
just writing a kill you don't need this
going to this right on

559
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,740
in daemon mode so you don't see any that
same thing

560
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,790
got anti CSRF token happily

561
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:29,940
Praha request forgery I don't go to
those

562
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,080
if you haven't need developing web
applications that you really ought to

563
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,879
look at them

564
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,980
and pop by the lost and we'll tell you
all about them

565
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,990
but the trouble is what on do security
testing

566
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:46,310
I whenever I come across these things it
come mixed blessing

567
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:49,379
is good because it means developers
understand developers understand the

568
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,280
problems in

569
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:54,410
affects them but also means the high to
low today from other problems

570
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:57,730
because a lot of security tools com cope
with them so they were trying to make

571
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,260
things two forms again

572
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:04,129
and both those posts will fail because
the right ok it hasn't been generated

573
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:08,510
what that does is that protect tokens
not simple regex 0

574
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:12,290
yet in might not honest know your
particular token be just put that in

575
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:16,029
says Apple but then sampled the tech
with you waste generated where

576
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:19,740
used when you doing in the fighting or
active scanning there's an option

577
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:23,609
rushing regenerate the Falcons for you
to implement it that way of testing

578
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:24,100
wanna

579
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:28,389
location which use these and found a
hole in your own abilities

580
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:33,580
opened up because that handles at ECS
Artec

581
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,949
don't think handles with 10 new features
ill is authentication

582
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:40,290
and is it known he stay but it's
something we can work a lot

583
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:45,020
a bother you while you can to falling
how an application authentic

584
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:48,040
authenticate how browse often takes the
application

585
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,690
at the moment we just have a form simple
forms but going to extend not as much as

586
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:52,639
possible

587
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,659
and you can tell it that how to detect
whether

588
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:58,970
something with an application is locked
in or not and then you can cite

589
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:03,180
when in fact this is loved it your
browser halted log in automatically

590
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:06,629
which is kinda a little trick by the you
why

591
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,750
but his sensual when you start doing a

592
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:13,200
the alt automated regression test Gupta

593
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,270
if you just how if you just use the
regression test

594
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:19,530
then you brushing test if they keep you
logged in

595
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:23,510
following but all the tax a nice
stand-alone ones Logan do something

596
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,690
logout

597
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:28,240
of course if not then try to reuse
session it's just gonna hit the login

598
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,580
page

599
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:33,520
but you cannot see configure this by the
API an exciting right

600
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,020
here's how to authenticate to this
application and then run the test

601
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,780
and then when sacks of trying to do the
actress Connie go I'm not lookin

602
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:45,010
I will login getting you session and
carry on from that

603
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:48,140
up the auto updating as I mentioned
before so that's

604
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,319
that means that particularly when in
continuous integration

605
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,770
you can pull down the very latest
changes on before you

606
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:58,990
doing it before we actually testing
looking up which is again

607
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:02,069
probably a more people new to secure
security

608
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:08,580
if the mods filter

609
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:12,569
so we have a standard mode are standard
mode is

610
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:15,900
do anything you can be as nasty as you
like up

611
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,840
day safe mode and she's not want
security people

612
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,210
but in safe mode as the only attacks

613
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:27,510
but he drained out so safe mode you
can't do anything nasty

614
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:30,550
now backcountry useful if you're looking
at

615
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:33,630
a I'll I unlike

616
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:37,120
wanna your production site for fight you
don't owe you can still use half its

617
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,710
kinda

618
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:41,850
so that will do a passive scanning and
let me see what's going on

619
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:45,170
but it won't allow you to do any attacks
so it's got a bit

620
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:49,280
it keeps you know it make sure you don't
do any damage

621
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,270
and there's also a protected mode i'm
for this

622
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:56,290
again you will be able to do anything
nasty until you actually

623
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:59,759
tell Zack what you want to attack so
what you can do

624
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,350
is you can say this ID

625
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:07,110
a context so contect

626
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:10,280
is actually just I set a regular
expressions

627
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,940
so you can sign you can say which ones
are included which ones are excluded

628
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,250
think actually say this is what they
makes a point application

629
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:20,910
I'm and then what she said that but
default

630
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:27,910
it in scope

631
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:31,250
the website concept is good so contexts
all

632
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,510
typically individual applications you
may only have one

633
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:38,270
context you may have multiple want to be
got their applications are different

634
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:38,940
machines or just

635
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:42,380
all on the same machine doing different
things a good thing if they're in scope

636
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,120
but they'd get

637
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:47,060
target icon up here and that means if UN
protected mode

638
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:52,410
you can still attack them but not I
think outside context actually here

639
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:56,529
this is where we define authentication
saying get the login URL

640
00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:00,400
host data on a lot of things you'll also
do a lot of these things but by right

641
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,210
clicks as well

642
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:06,520
if you're playing around with that

643
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,160
the first time it's well worth right
clicking on everything so there's

644
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,160
always Holodomor options

645
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:17,490
that you've got from heating you say to
login request logo

646
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:24,490
a SOLAS con

647
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:34,000
something additional features up auto
tagging

648
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:41,819
the example a so not pass a series a
maker expressions which you can add to

649
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,400
as well

650
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,390
so it looks a certain things in this
case you can see very quickly that that

651
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,500
particular forms got it. CSRF token

652
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:55,040
come in useful see what's going on Paul
Scott that's nice included a spot on

653
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,100
that standard now I decided it wasn't
quite relevant

654
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:02,310
what most people do it's not in my but
if stills convenient it works pretty

655
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:02,820
well

656
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,030
I but you can download that may add on
marketplace you want it now

657
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:10,210
also got a script console on this is
quite fun if you want to get more

658
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:14,390
and stuff so the script console I said
to give you a window

659
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:18,589
where you can type strict and we support
and I think that

660
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:21,630
Java support so you get JavaScript by
default

661
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:25,200
but you can put a pretty much Negi I
think jobs

662
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,770
course huge range is Piketon Ruby

663
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:32,490
pretty much any scripting languages
supported and because when I open source

664
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:33,180
project

665
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:36,419
we don't we don't have anything Chris so

666
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,220
you can actually act as all with the
internals all internal data structures

667
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:43,890
keychain to you I can go in and delete
things being

668
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:47,680
cause all sorts of havoc have a the
script consul give you really powerful

669
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,220
accessing loop through

670
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:54,100
on the site 3d let you do anything you
like it essentially same issue rewriting

671
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:54,450
that

672
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:57,680
on the fly so we want to get deion

673
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,870
involved taking up the level of the
report generation forget

674
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:07,330
but we could be better be is easy to
read reports and small can support this

675
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:09,610
is something up for the comp talk about
a great deal

676
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:13,320
thought not leverage involved it for
some the other that developers are

677
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,620
youth not cost a lot often taking two
applications

678
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:20,130
so I'm told from the best smart cards of
any security told

679
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:23,180
said context in scope

680
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,810
so you can now define different areas
the application ok with that different

681
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:27,900
applications different

682
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:32,930
on things like the authentication and
properties have those applications

683
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:38,480
session comparison axis come very simple
things they can actually have

684
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,690
both you can have use that with one
particular user

685
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:46,570
and then use that as another user you
can compare and see what they both can

686
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:51,390
on what they can't do Mon account to and
compare the URL side by side

687
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:55,900
this is kinda very basic but one of the
things we've also got

688
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:59,660
apps is no their up

689
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:03,670
we now support a much better support
pretty to be sessions

690
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:07,160
says that understands what obsessions aw

691
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:13,029
30c down here

692
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:16,510
on that is keeping track aborting
sessions you've got

693
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:20,400
take actually have multiple sessions at
the same time you can open it crackin

694
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,130
you session

695
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:25,280
she logged in as multiple users and can
switch between them

696
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,490
and so that about actually be

697
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:31,549
is it's early days but I think it can be
very powerful

698
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:35,210
and one thing I want to make sure is
that we actually stopping up access

699
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:36,340
control much better

700
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:40,720
only anyone does it very well but we've
got all the building block him pay

701
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,080
so this is something is getting too low
to work on in a into

702
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,150
well coming months and years also

703
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:51,330
okay external applications so you can
configure other applications that

704
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:55,759
on you want to invoke from that money
advantage is that as in past context

705
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,250
across

706
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:59,530
see can right click in the sites many
and invoke an application

707
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:04,130
an impasse across whatever on details
across from the URL

708
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:08,390
on the promises passes across the
application make it is easy possibly

709
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:11,799
important information packet any
information that that application

710
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:18,320
generates as well annual thing we got

711
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,860
is dynamic SSL Certificates so if you
want the cation

712
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:26,150
uses Heps them one of the problems is

713
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:31,190
typically browser on schedule to
generate their own certificates a course

714
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:35,100
you know that then your browser will
stop complaining like crazy

715
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,850
what you can do it in fact it generate
your own root CA certificate

716
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:42,200
on is just for you not one standard one
of your personal one

717
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,529
and then you can pull 12 Brownson trust
that and then

718
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:49,270
then Apple be able to infect the eight
the

719
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:52,580
H yes communication secret to show
what's going on but

720
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:59,100
you browse will still be happy the wings
if

721
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:03,890
if babbitt you know will lapse soulful
we'll security needs

722
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:08,009
afraid not and security is very complex

723
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:12,060
and one thing ABS use the automated
features

724
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:14,990
you cannot detect all the
vulnerabilities this so the

725
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:17,830
vulnerabilities a relatively easy to
take by scanning

726
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:21,090
and some the town thought logical
vulnerabilities so the logical

727
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:22,700
possibility of the cation

728
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,240
that no toll is gonna find out so you do
need somebody

729
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,379
think actually going through and looking
at these things

730
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:32,990
and in the end if you're serious about
security

731
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:36,109
then then

732
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:39,180
you actually if you just testing for
stuff for the apt to develop

733
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:42,759
it's a bit late we should be thinking
about security all the way through you

734
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,650
have to understand about security

735
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:49,070
and what touched upon abilities all how
to avoid them

736
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:53,670
to I it also helps to understand how
people go backpacking or application

737
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:55,010
that's how I got involved

738
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:58,240
knowing what the bad guys will do then
you can maybe

739
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,759
vacation package detected and so one
thing i think is really a few

740
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,720
have a good understanding security you
stop thinking they could make out making

741
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,529
application security where

742
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:11,370
if it's relevant cupcakes nichols' so
then an application can actually see

743
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:14,589
what's being attacked maybe put some
fields in there which haunted hidden

744
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:16,180
field which have no use

745
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:20,859
on but are actually taken a result a
trap so you can see what's going on

746
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:23,790
and if somebody changed want to know if
you know you're being attacked lock them

747
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:26,070
out to whatever

748
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:29,090
up I'm you to bring you really need to
consider security throughout the

749
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:30,300
development

750
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,280
so things like threat modeling think
about how an application could be

751
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,200
attacked

752
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,839
and attacks if they're reduction do you
need only facilities

753
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:41,560
is a facility actually adding to me how
potential holes

754
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:46,990
make it work putting in that

755
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:50,060
and static source code analysis all the
things are really good

756
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:53,299
using security libros keeping love is
something I mean it

757
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,010
that another to all this stuff is
another talk itself I just want to make

758
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:57,050
sure he didn't think

759
00:44:57,050 --> 00:45:00,270
that would be all we need

760
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:03,880
on a little bit about Samoa resources
that can help you

761
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:08,270
the top 10 so this is one the most
famous up for the most famous of project

762
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:12,610
the top 10 application risks so explains
very clearly

763
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:15,820
what those risks all how they can be
exploited

764
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:19,940
how you can avoid I can prevent them
from happening

765
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:24,600
62 Realty with anyone that any those
videos

766
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:28,130
a few not many have their own YouTube
the length of the oocyte

767
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:31,770
they're really great introductions three
or four now

768
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:35,020
hopelessly woman's up fairly soon as
well so it's a really great fear is to

769
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:35,650
be new to

770
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:40,330
application security chichi the CiCi's a
really good because they're

771
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:43,500
very they're meant to be smaller
consumable so easily

772
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,360
game head around there are things like
Development Guide testing guide Richard

773
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,620
Wright resources but they're not

774
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:54,130
you know that ft and not great fun to
read good as reference guide to

775
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:58,830
up eat be something which is librarian
available in various

776
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:03,130
out different languages which which if
you like the security features

777
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:06,670
you can make use of unbroken web
application project

778
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:11,410
b2b like if the whole set all vulnerable
web application service you want to

779
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:12,670
learn about

780
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:16,050
application security is a great way to
give me something to play around with

781
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:17,370
some to attack something to

782
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:21,089
legally break-in happened to you on a
course

783
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:24,610
I and there's loads more so go to BW

784
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:27,900
I will stop all I and the whole

785
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:32,180
as low as a great information that a nap
before

786
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:35,330
any questions one thing I would like to
know

787
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:38,540
my last question for you have I
convinced any view that's worth

788
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:44,050
downloading the app in giving ago

789
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:47,460
excellent that's what I want to hear
right on beyond me I will stand

790
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:51,110
so if you wanna come and talk to me %uh
in person please do

791
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:58,110
on but before then said first question

792
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:20,710
thank you I had a question

793
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:21,720
for instance

794
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,040
the prince and the

795
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:29,400
pro site scripting uses sonya
application

796
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:33,110
that was using scripts thanks and then
Lords 1

797
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:36,500
but thats relatively easy year for me

798
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:40,250
our site scripting most of the times
they will be more advanced than using

799
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:43,340
the crazy said that's like

800
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:46,460
the office complex four times or using

801
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:50,680
CSS except JavaScript in them as in like
a list of those

802
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:55,359
field such a simple so the the way back
to text cross-site scripting

803
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:59,650
at it will not find all a it only looks
for a flight takeoff

804
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:02,750
spitting on abilities I but find all of
them

805
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:05,780
but what it does it in Jax a

806
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:10,580
safe token into each printer into and
then it looks to see whether that's

807
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:11,160
reflected

808
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:14,330
the page and also try Skype America
cases as well

809
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:18,610
so it then looks aware cuz and looks the
context of it

810
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:21,780
so looks to see which taxes sane

811
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:24,940
I'm whether it's actually with an attack
with within JavaScript with us in

812
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:25,600
comments

813
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,920
I to the whole series of tests and what
which buy this photo

814
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:32,980
not so actually does a whole series a
test targeting

815
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:37,240
the particular context each everywhere
it's reflected

816
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,939
so it actually gives a very low

817
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:46,020
right all both positive on is actually
very effective a better

818
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:49,450
here is a test called website so I think
that the best

819
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:52,560
the most effective texted web scanners

820
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:56,610
i'm aware. open fourth one anyway and
FAP scored a 100 percent

821
00:48:56,610 --> 00:49:00,080
finding the cross-site scripting and 0
percent

822
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,630
on fourth posted now I'm certainly not
say

823
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:07,240
that just shows is good at that take a
test but aidid

824
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:11,080
in general it's one of the more
effective cross-site scripting

825
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,450
portability scanners but on everything
which is why we got a fucking

826
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:17,919
service especially the one particular
field then you can force it with a Lowes

827
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:18,990
about stuff from

828
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:25,220
load library anybody else yes

829
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:29,520
were can you compare and contrast it
please to the competition

830
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,960
web scarab for proxy others okay

831
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,720
Vera okay I will try and be as
reasonable as possible

832
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,790
though anyone disagrees with him saying
shout out there are a lot of tools in

833
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:41,410
the space

834
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:44,420
the original OS one was web scarab

835
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:47,920
up I actually look to web scarab early
on

836
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,250
I when I decided I want to do open
source working thought about working

837
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:51,730
until

838
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:55,200
I thought about working on web startup
webster

839
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,629
at the time have been updated for a long
time as well it is being updated

840
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:04,270
but not very much and I don't think I'm
the only person who thinks

841
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:08,259
it's quite complex stolen not very
intuitive so

842
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:12,490
I didn't want to I decided it was easy
take a simple tool

843
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:16,600
like paradise and that more
functionality intake halted difficult to

844
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,360
use product like web Sarah make it easy
to use

845
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,600
but also its I want to learn by doing
things as well

846
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:27,490
though I think webster a bit harder to
use it's not as functional anymore

847
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:31,490
and there's very little work going on it
so slow to work going on

848
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:35,970
that works we doing a lot of stuff book
is a different matter

849
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:39,490
book is a really great tool I'm not
gonna criticize it

850
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:44,830
on however 1 it's not open source it's
not free

851
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:48,819
it should not cost doesn't cost very
much so you know from up

852
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:52,690
it's actually well worth it sup and if
the toll I would expect

853
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:57,490
special pen test is to use having said
that I think special pen tester should

854
00:50:57,490 --> 00:51:01,919
really understand or the main toll and
the strengths and weaknesses in Houston

855
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:02,580
accordingly

856
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:06,400
I think that is now one of those tolls
so impressed with fantastic haven't

857
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:06,980
looked at that

858
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:11,980
you doing self-service but 31 expect the
pros to use up all the time

859
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:15,890
but I think that is more is more
suitable

860
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:19,480
a more effective for developers
functional test for the people need

861
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,440
application security

862
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,700
and

863
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:27,200
okay I

864
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,149
I'm really sorry but unfortunately we
around I running out of time so

865
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:35,310
if for any other questions you will
probably can interrupt that the speaker

866
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:38,009
and so thank you and
