misinformation on tell you say I want to
see one thing when we were feeling

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,089
known to overfeeding unit we need to
have solutions

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,930
making which we'll make the suit we need
to have solution

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,230
weighty to make so too in order to don't

to put sounds of all with taste I'm
unedited

106
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:24,310
okay I obvious but I can make lots not
smart

107
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,620
why not using Open Data we were open
that up

108
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,050
you up over beings organized in order to
be

109
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:36,259
in order to be in and that it is bad by
or deny toes

110
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:39,389
we've opened at a UFC Monti quipped the
aim obvious

111
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:43,449
%uh Lisa Eivissa DC research to peak

112
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:46,720
is to take all the informations

113
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,910
Seuss's like we keep a job and two
league then

114
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,190
one between overrun and to make gordon
et

115
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:57,500
9 and two birds earn to be a man with
computer

116
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,490
to make analyses about take for example
it was talking about

117
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,229
David Cameron but we've Wikipedia I know
but the Beacon min

118
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:10,068
is a politician and I we aim now able to
save %uh

119
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:14,639
but mine used is dodging about politics
and I need to be able

120
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,849
to ads lot of may need on my takes and
it's really important

121
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:21,909
in order to make may fit doing

122
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,560
and other things I can make that the
main menus I just take

123
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,090
all menus and I make and I will regroup

124
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,359
all when you see me now one between
overrun

125
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,470
and likeness I can I can say okay always
news

126
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:39,509
the 13 out talking about the subject are
often use them talking

127
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:42,639
about another subject and lately I can
make

128
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,660
morrow and more about my news and about
filtering

129
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:50,800
again now I have on my news I just used
to store them

130
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,160
and families are used know I'll noise
quill death buses

131
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,289
gone a.m. the chosen which is a graph
you wanted that less is

132
00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:05,289
you in used in Semantic Web its

133
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:09,069
it look really fine and it enable me to
make

134
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:13,690
mining to organize my data in its work
to relieve recently

135
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:18,009
in this in my project okay I am in
databases

136
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:21,650
I am i informations and now I need to
make to

137
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:25,539
to write and web interface is in order
to see my news

138
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:30,039
I have made %uh BX I just need I did in
I just need to translate

139
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:33,140
my my questions to a computer

140
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,399
for this I use Speegle request it's gone

141
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,750
it's come from with SIMATIC and the aim

142
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,708
is June mister white week Westlake in
MySQL

143
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:47,500
and two to us food that addresses for
growth that elicits

144
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,529
yeah I am the example talking about
David Cameron

145
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:54,830
I can't say I want all informations

149
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,279
we've the filtering on Benson

150
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,029
it's not just on loads it's way beyond
gonna

151
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:16,839
on context I can say I want to the best
son David Cameron

152

to suggest that the talk peekskill or
some other teams
