1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,689
a good morning everybody

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:07,020
and unwelcome welcome to the second

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,440
force them I'm

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,530
Sam incredibly privilege to be able to
speak in front view all

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:18,520
the only problem is of course that the
acoustics

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,619
this room I like being in a swimming
baths at the bottom of the deep wells

7
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,189
so if you can't hear me please

8
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:29,369
asked me to shout up and

9
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:33,760
the other thing I'd like to say is if
you would like to ask questions

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,680
please feel free to ask questions at
anytime

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,450
during the talk theoretically there'll
be people running around with

12
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,410
microphones

13
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,578
to because your question that

14
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:49,410
streaming but don't worry even if you
don't get the microphone in time

15
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,620
because I will repeat the questions the
streaming

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,620
will be able to capture it so

17
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,690
I my name is Jeremy Allison and

18
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,640
I work for Google in the open source
program office

19
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,340
in California in Mountain View on the
big Google campus

20
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,189
but having said that forget anything

21
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,059
I i mention to be with Google this is
not Google Talk

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,780
it has not been vetted by Google legal
or even seen by

23
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,930
a.m. due to legal so I please don't take
anything I say is

24
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,140
anything on behalf Google I

25
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,090
and don't don't hold my very poor jokes
against them Exeter Exeter

26
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,740
so having said that 1 I'm gonna talk

27
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,170
about today is the some before

28
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,340
release which is

29
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,560
the fourth major release at the sound
the project

30
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,030
I and we did that just before Christmas
and so I'm gonna fill you in a little

31
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:50,380
bit

32
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,710
about the background at the beginning at
the talk

33
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:57,279
it's not terribly technical he gets a
little more technical

34
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,130
going further on I but I can actually
drill-down

35
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,600
into any technical issues that people
might wanna raise or mine

36
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,429
ask or if I don't know the answer I have
some very capable some party members

37
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,539
sitting in the front row so I can always

38
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:13,970
compound differ the questions to them
which really helps

39
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:19,020
so Samba is festival is raining here who
doesn't know what somebody's

40
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,450
just thought I'd better check and I
thank you yes December team guys

41
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:27,280
oh well I'm glad about that I'm because
you know all

42
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,680
commonly the impression I get is you
guys use still going on

43
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,680
did you die at a long time ago um

44
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,709
this is disco man we never die I N

45
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:40,849
so were very old project

46
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:43,950
we actually predate Linex itself

47
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,359
when we started I am we a major platform
was

48
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,410
son of us for not even so lawrence yet

49
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,250
I and HPUX an axe Linex

50
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,620
at the time was not very interesting too
is because he didn't have

51
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:05,040
a network stack so I say we've we've
been around for a very long time

52
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,260
Island back in the days when I don't
know whether

53
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,209
anyone remembers this doesn't even
remember the days when you could buy Red

54
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:13,730
Hat Linux as a box set at your local
store

55
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,909
cool so so you remember at the time it
used to

56
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:21,269
have little stickers on it saying comes
with the sambar 2.0 whatever

57
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:24,349
and you know Apache one-dot something

58
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:29,250
I those were the days wanna releases
some the the number used to be printed

59
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,890
on the side if the Linux box

60
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:35,029
these days I think we've probably become

61
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,489
more part if the infrastructure I

62
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:42,799
and so the perception is that some has
been around a long time work I have an

63
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,080
old and boring projects

64
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,239
there's not much exciting going on I'm
I'm here to it disabuse you of that

65
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,319
I'm here to excite you that somebody can
get you all to contribute

66
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,720
because work we're not quite as bad as
Pearl was still going

67
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,830
and cell you know

68
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:05,500
does does anyone need a local file
server anymore doesn't everybody just

69
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,569
ok load from their mobile phones into
the cloud and let everything take care

70
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:10,280
of its

71
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,830
you know um so many people here actually
do use cloud storage

72
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:19,660
quite quite a few I mean you know I must
confess I

73
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,250
have my music collection up in the
clouds so that I can stream it wherever

74
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:23,970
I go

75
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,169
a.m. in a band with committing arm

76
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:31,690
but how many people also have actual
local storage a home

77
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,770
I yes so that's where we come in you see

78
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,469
I am their their %uh still very good
reasons

79
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,630
for having a file server in your closet
or indeed file server

80
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:47,180
in your enterprise I you know I mean at
least for the home

81
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:53,400
and for the home products legal reasons
why you'd still kinda need

82
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,469
local storage wanted the might be that
you might have some files that you might

83
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:57,729
not

84
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:01,729
let's just say he might not feel
comfortable lootings your cloud service

85
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:03,900
provider

86
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,060
for one reason or another I am

87
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,880
so it's I was like the Alpina I can't
remember the bank that did it

88
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,550
that came printed with the home taping
is killing music and illegal

89
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,320
and they managed to slip a cassette tape
into the final into the sleeve and it

90
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:19,740
said

91
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,479
and he is a copy is it to see a cassette
so you can help

92
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:26,590
I un the other reason is come

93
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,919
how many people recognize the object on
the right

94
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,520
over recall how many people actually
used one

95
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,109
all were less less so might my first
that's actually the people who don't

96
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,320
recognize it what that is

97
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,449
is an acoustic coupla a modem the

98
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:47,110
very very first kinda modems where you
actually plot to the physical telephone

99
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,100
sets

100
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:52,080
into a coupla to get access to the what
was in the internet then it was

101
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,960
your local bulletin board system Mike my
first modem actually looks very much

102
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,818
like that

103
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:59,840
and had the massive speeder for 1200
baud

104
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,190
down down stream and

105
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:09,150
75 upstream so the other reasons that
cloud storage can be a little tricky

106
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:13,169
is that you know the areas in the world
where that would be considered a lot a

107
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:13,940
band with

108
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,199
so it's kinda hard to copy multi
terabyte falls around

109
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:21,729
when you having to do things through
something like that

110
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:25,520
so having local file story he's actually
quite useful

111
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,549
you think so so well what happened
December you know what happen team and

112
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:29,960
we

113
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,020
we used to be close they say wait where
did you go

114
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,690
well we he'd

115
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,930
and kinda thrived here

116
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,080
soul um

117
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,419
I imagine this there's a a wonderful
electronic shop

118
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:50,389
in Silicon Valley call fries does anyone
ever been there a little

119
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:54,380
few people period eats it's like a
warehouse

120
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:59,440
full electronics and electronic goods I
once wanted two rounds the network

121
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,469
attached storage section

122
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,500
and literally every single

123
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,990
product on the shelf the network
attached storage shelf it had sambar

124
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:08,580
inside

125
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,508
none of them sedative course days is
having some summer X on the box a long

126
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:13,169
gone

127
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:16,258
but every single one of those was
actually running a version its amber

128
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:17,190
inside

129
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:21,130
I'll thank you very much Ubuntu gap at

130
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:25,710
you know how carefully yes a an online
account yeah

131
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,758
I thought turn that off anything in mind
some hope is not gonna keep doing that

132
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,139
to be doing the talk

133
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:36,139
I so we actually went and he'd in the
network attached storage market

134
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:40,099
and we've actually thrived I'm quite
well down there

135
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:44,530
a so that the 1i refund amazing does
anyone recognize that little device upon

136
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,229
the top left

137
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:51,389
anyone so what it is I know it's a
little hard to see from where you are

138
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:54,780
it actually a little what they call a
wart

139
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,109
which has and Ethernet port in one end

140
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,940
and a USB port on the other and so you
take your USB

141
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,060
drive that you buy you plug it into that
you put the network cable internet thing

142
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,110
and it's a file server its Linex and
sambar

143
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:13,620
in this just incredibly tiny little box

144
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,860
so we scale from things like that which
will turn

145
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,199
any of the portable and USB Drive you
might bind

146
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,410
places like fries into nasa portable
nasser

147
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:28,539
to things like that does anyone
recognize the the object on on the right

148
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:32,919
it's kinda specific I stole it from
there from there advertising website

149
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,990
I that's actually and IBM so naps

150
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,959
system called scale-out network attached
storage

151
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,309
and that's one of those products which I
love from IBM where

152
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:46,560
if you have to ask how much it is you
can't afford it

153
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,170
so but that also run sambar

154
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:54,750
nothing scale thanks to just
unbelievable ungodly amount

155
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,880
storage me to use by movies

156
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,029
movie producers who are writing for Cape
you know frames and that

157
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:05,410
that putting one frame any

158
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,880
in a separate file for you know 25 us

159
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,000
eighty frames a second know what %uh the
rate is just need

160
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,779
a normal amounts a band which anomalous
stored in that same but to

161
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:19,050
so I I like to I like to joke that any

162
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,689
network attached storage costing less
than twenty thousand dollars or more

163
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,600
than a million

164
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,010
has some bring it but the mid-range is
still kinda colonized by EMC and NetApp

165
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,310
for some strange reason but so we

166
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:36,569
we actually do extraordinarily well in
in the network attached storage market

167
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:42,320
and primarily I am we had a a lot of
tension at the beginning of the product

168
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:42,970
project

169
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:46,080
all we product that you would buy

170
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,080
sort of like you know sambar with new
washes whiter brand

171
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,640
or a week in two parts the building all
the products

172
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,420
and I i think thats kinda family come
down on the understanding that what we

173
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:56,880
are

174
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,700
is a key two parts that all the people
used to build products

175
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,160
actually I i'm quite I'm quite happy
about that because it means I don't have

176
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,560
to focus on writing management
interfaces which really hard and we suck

177
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,729
at doing anyway

178
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:13,220
if there's anyone used what yes yet yes
so you know how bad we are

179
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,510
secured release came out last week so
yes we really don't want to be in the

180
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:20,250
business is doing management interfaces
you want to be doing file sitting and

181
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:26,220
other interesting things so

182
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,459
what took you so long I am so I used to
joke

183
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:34,000
the I'll we were taking a long time to
write some before but at least

184
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,790
gonna come out before Duke Nukem Forever
I

185
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:42,459
and then they finished you Nukem Forever
up

186
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:45,790
not a terrible game but it it was really
sad

187
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,939
that they actually finished the that
classic maple where products

188
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,680
before we finished doing them before I

189
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,339
so they're actually many reasons for
that which I'm gonna go into

190
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:01,870
before actually stop talking about
what's in some before

191
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,959
and essentially we

192
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,359
we had some challenges with it and

193
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,990
from overcoming those challenges
currently take quite a long time

194
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:18,220
so has anyone heard have a boil the
ocean project

195
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,480
included the phrase boil the ocean I
okay if if you view is

196
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,529
commonly used by Bice exxon market
systems engineers where

197
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:30,209
they were talking about when software
design is sit down and try and design

198
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:31,160
new things

199
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,930
they keep adding features and saying
what would it be cool if it would do

200
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:34,380
that

201
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:38,140
would be cool if would do that and by
the end of it you have a project that

202
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,300
essentially to run would be the power
that you would have to boil the ocean

203
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,229
in order to to successfully run it and
some before

204
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,279
started to head in that direction I'm

205
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,510
there were more more pieces being added
I

206
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:55,870
and it started to do more and more and
it

207
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,079
kinda spiral a little bit out of control
for a while

208
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:03,180
and its to the Greek credits have many
the summer team members who worked on it

209
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,250
that eventually

210
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,910
they manage to rein back the ambitions
and say okay

211
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,060
we really have to get this thing out
before the end of the next millennium so

212
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,029
let's stop calling features lights

213
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:16,399
start saying you know this works as well
as its going two for now we'll

214
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,260
will finish the rest a bit later and
they they managed to cut it down to a

215
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,370
more manageable

216
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:26,279
well theoretically more manageable size
project

217
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,459
I am the other thing that nearly
happened

218
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:33,739
we managed to avoid I'm very glad about
is

219
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,930
we nearly ended up forking the project

220
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,510
and that's happened once before and it's
very painful so how many here

221
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,870
a worked on a project for and you want

222
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:48,510
yet few people its if you don't work on
a project and you don't know

223
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,870
he sensually it's like going through a
divorce but you know kinda

224
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,889
uglier a and

225
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:58,410
so each said if developers takes the
tools and goes home intakes copies at

226
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,180
the codes as well you guys suck

227
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,170
we're gonna do it our way and what was
happening

228
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:07,170
least within Samba for a long while was

229
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:11,410
there was the same but what were called
the Samba three guys which was

230
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,850
I was one of those guys which with a
kind of the older

231
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,110
developers who were working on the file
serving project

232
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,529
who are working on the file so the party
the peace that we used in the network

233
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:22,990
attached storage

234
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:26,440
and then the with some before guys who
were gonna replace everything in some

235
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,950
the three and gonna do it better

236
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:31,070
and you know gonna rewrite everything
from scratch

237
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:35,230
it was going to be better cleaner faster
they're gonna Active Directory as well

238
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:38,709
you know and we started to drift apart

239
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:43,170
and you can actually still see that if
you download a source code

240
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:47,569
in that we have source 3 and source for
directories still

241
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,800
but the wonderful thing now is that we
need both

242
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,329
those directories to actually build the
entire project

243
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:58,589
and what was slowly doing is we're
moving the pieces

244
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:02,519
out of those directories into it the top
level source directory

245
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:05,810
and hopefully eventually the source
three in source for

246
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:09,160
directories will be legacy that we will
eventually

247
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,569
managed to remove and that took a lot of
effort

248
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:16,029
that was a hard thing to achieve people

249
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:20,079
people had to kill parts the code that
they were very very fond of and

250
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,180
nobody likes to do that and its to the
great credit many people that they were

251
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,859
they were able to to fix that

252
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,240
so before we managed to remit everything
and and this is

253
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,630
one of the reasons course why we ended
up taking so long

254
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:38,560
to get the project I'm so

255
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,849
there were two file service some before

256
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,089
this summer force the source for brunch
originally started

257
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:48,320
with an attempt to rewrite the file
server

258
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,889
as applicable very clean a synchronous

259
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:54,920
engine and thats

260
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,219
was called the anti the FS standing for
the Windows NT

261
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,350
virtual filesystem and then the SMB

262
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,260
smbd which was December 3 the source 3
version of it

263
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,329
was essentially older but the thing is

264
00:15:09,329 --> 00:15:12,969
what happened is ass the code was
developed

265
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:17,649
as new ideas were created in source 4 we
kept stealing them bringing them back

266
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:20,050
into saw three so essentially

267
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:24,349
their ID is still warm it's just that
they ended up being merged back

268
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,389
into the original code base

269
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:30,940
so how many people have actually worked
in a proper a project that said okay

270
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,500
we're going to rewrite everything from
scratch replace it

271
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,089
and actually worked okay but what

272
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:41,420
what what was the project I'm just kinda
curious

273
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,680
a small part in application yet I saw
there was another person who put her

274
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,790
hand up

275
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:51,339
was a I sorry

276
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:55,240
0 X 386 was I I don't believe that was a
rewrite

277
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,370
that was no so it i think is probably
more similar to

278
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:03,829
December itself it was a for took over
but it wasn't an actual rewrite

279
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:07,209
so what happens is when you have a very
large successful projects

280
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:11,290
and that's been used by many many people
it's really hard to write it from

281
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:11,899
scratch

282
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:16,370
and replace it I'm this is actually one
of the things that

283
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,670
summer the microsoft engineers have been
some very good books about

284
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:23,449
it's much easier to take that old code
base and the factory

285
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:26,800
clean it up and keeping running because

286
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,189
at least at that point you have
interested customers with testing it

287
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,329
it's much harder

288
00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:34,839
to take a brand new code base and
reproduce

289
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,680
everything that the original el pais to
Baystate and those those projects

290
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,969
don't tend to succeed most the time and
so that's

291
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:46,290
pretty much what happened here in that
the file so the peace migrated

292
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:49,509
the good parts at the and TV FS salsa

293
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:53,639
migrated back into smbd the other piece

294
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:56,889
we still have to win by demyans Witcher
the

295
00:16:56,889 --> 00:17:00,930
authentication demons that talk to a
domain controller

296
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:04,959
um the second one right now we've
managed to contain it

297
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,309
we still had to have it simply because
we didn't have the time to merge the two

298
00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:13,379
in the time frame that we had finish to
actually get a really sad

299
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,380
so what we have is we have a winbind
that is used on Member Services

300
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:22,559
members the demesne which is the
standard winbind that people use to

301
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,869
and then we have a smaller more focused
winbind

302
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:29,049
that only runs on the Active Directory
domain controller

303
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:32,418
it is our ultimate goal two minutes
those two demons but what

304
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:35,679
right now we're just having to live with
it I

305
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,880
and then there were many many utility
light base there was a whole replacement

306
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,400
parameter library

307
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,890
to assess replacement string libraries
Island

308
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:47,419
you know many if the people working on
source for they went through

309
00:17:47,419 --> 00:17:50,500
and you know massive credits to them
they

310
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,820
they did the hard work merging stuff
together

311
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,909
so that we can use common libraries

312
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,370
sometimes which is the source for
version sometime we chose a source

313
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,159
reversion

314
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,390
but there's a lot of work a lot of ace
compound a synchronous code is

315
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:08,950
the whole new set event mechanisms that
were invented

316
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:12,429
that eventually came back together in
top-level libraries

317
00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:15,610
and you can see the fruits at this in
that even libraries

318
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:18,668
and other things comments when I the
summer project

319
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:23,070
a new type of part was actually leading
to it review which is this code and not

320
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:27,320
scream at each other in meetings again
and and to actually say you know that I

321
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,649
actually does right

322
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,830
good code even though he's a jerk who
works on smbd

323
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:35,320
I hate him you know and that kind of
thing is I'm sure you know

324
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,928
is a very hard thing to once you've
pushed

325
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:42,270
sells the park it's hard to get back
together again and

326
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:46,330
I love you does not trample this is
still a lotta seething resentment

327
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,980
underneath the on the surface of course
I like to say the

328
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,910
December project in December team is
that class is the master

329
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:53,919
passive-aggressive

330
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,750
you know well if you don't like my code
sweetie but I use yours

331
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,970
on that issue but it does does
eventually a

332
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:06,140
work and you know well we're getting
better and a little more

333
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,450
a little more used to each other again
that's really is the hard part

334
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:14,530
I am some have already talked a lot
about this

335
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:18,530
I am their all

336
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:23,340
yes so the actually I kinda already
covered a lot of the things on the slide

337
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:27,549
I the really hard requirement the one
that we laid down

338
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:30,889
had to happen was no matter what we were
doing

339
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:36,010
in creating the new version you had to
be able to take an existing

340
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:40,410
sambar insulation you had to be able to
tighten make install

341
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:43,660
run a script any have to keep working

342
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:48,750
I am or at least had to be minimal
disruptions to people's existing

343
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:52,350
Samba installations and file server
installations its

344
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,740
it's not completely seamless but

345
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,289
there have been a lot has been a lot of
work put in to actually making that

346
00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:01,289
migration path work

347
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:04,890
I'm not one of the reasons for that is
the people who create

348
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:08,570
network attached storage devices I am

349
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:11,879
they have a very stable code base that
used to working with

350
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,559
we would like them obviously moved to
the new features that we have in some

351
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,490
before the 0

352
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:21,039
I and we've done that by basically
providing them with

353
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,080
extra new flashy features that we think
they'll want but we couldn't

354
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,178
force a massive change in that we
couldn't say on dove course you have to

355
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:30,919
throw away all the configuration
management tools

356
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:34,610
everything thanks to change I'm and you
have to do everything a completely

357
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,479
different way

358
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,700
so the Harvick wyman is that we week
didn't want to make the OEM suffer

359
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:44,710
a massive man is disrupted because to be
honest many apps work for those aliens

360
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:49,659
and so you know it's in our interest to
make sure that everything keeps working

361
00:20:49,659 --> 00:20:54,559
um this still some ongoing discussions

362
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,260
on how to make the ATP's work had a
separate some pieces

363
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:02,419
I'm going to that a little little bit
later on in the talk

364
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:05,750
but I can say things things are getting
back together and we now we now have one

365
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:09,020
code base which I'm really quite happy
about

366
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,490
so what the actual new features I mean
I've been talking about some affordable

367
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:16,679
what is it what's the new thing well the
really big new thing

368
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:20,610
is that its a full Active Directory

369
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:25,070
domain controller replacement I mean you
can migrate

370
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:28,860
from an existing Active Directory I
Microsoft

371
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,799
you can replicate to assemble on you can
promote the sample one

372
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,000
and it will keep you can then turn off
the microphone it will keep working

373
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,120
I'm you can do the reverse you know if
people wanna

374
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,379
migrate from sambar the old

375
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,500
the summer 320 elder based

376
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,799
domain controller you couldn't migrated
to Samba for

377
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:53,070
and that you can replicate the windows
one you can then turn of the sample

378
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:56,178
so it actually works both ways I

379
00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:59,309
the other thing is that's really the
thing that's really cool is that it

380
00:21:59,309 --> 00:21:59,730
actually

381
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:04,720
integrates seamlessly with all the
Windows domain controller tools

382
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,970
so and this is for the Windows guys I
mean I'm not

383
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:12,309
at the main administrator or haven't
been for about 10 to 15 years now

384
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:17,190
but all the tools that those people use
like Group Policy Editor is accept rate

385
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:20,710
they all work against some before the
main control

386
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:24,520
so that's very very cool this still I'm
you know because we're

387
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,990
UNIX and Linux and command line based
people this amber tool that actually

388
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:32,940
configures things on the command line so
that you can do this

389
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:37,120
inside article in its box of course we
thought about putting

390
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,889
all those options into the net binary
which had become a kitchen sink

391
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:45,010
administration tools and look Lee
decided this was a terrible idea and we

392
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,570
were going to do it

393
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:51,189
so how many people here have heard of
Microsoft's new OS two me too

394
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:54,929
three okay no that many

395
00:22:54,929 --> 00:23:00,370
so Microsoft have a.m. had in SF an SMB
sits protocol many years is the one that

396
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,580
Windows XP

397
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,510
I the box uses they actually did a lot
of work

398
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:08,850
and rewrote the protocol created a new
protocol called S&P

399
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:12,770
to which we fully supported in some 3.6

400
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:16,780
and now they've added a bunch of new
clustering features

401
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:21,100
to make a SMB 3 they were gonna call SMB
2.2

402
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,350
but it was such a a radical change their
marketing people

403
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:27,760
to call its amber s mp3 instead I

404
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,990
and so we actually have preliminary
support for that

405
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:34,159
going to what that means a little bit
later on

406
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,890
I the other thing is we got serious
about using it

407
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:41,900
all the extra course that you have in
your service and so the i/o pass within

408
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,580
sambar

409
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,949
and now completely parallel sus summer
itself

410
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:49,470
at least the file server engine is
essentially and a synchronous state

411
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,130
machine

412
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:53,419
that uses threads under the covers to
get multiple paths

413
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:57,919
I going on today so it's time to be easy
to understand in terms

414
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,330
well as much as a state machine can be a
in terms of how to program it

415
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:06,500
and yet it still has the flexibility to
use threats in the places where you

416
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,640
really need it

417
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,440
and Microsoft introduced you handle
types that

418
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,549
will cover disconnection failover

419
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:20,730
and we're starting to support those that
came out only in some before 20

420
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:26,450
and the most full support for that in
some before one

421
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:31,159
I'm so hoop earrings she administers not

422
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:34,460
directory anyone all this that's great

423
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,549
still some people here use Windows south
so I wanted

424
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:41,200
come to Android and to Mac and Linux
these days but yes

425
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,539
the legacy guys like me I am yet

426
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:48,190
a stuff everyone else essentially Active
Directory is those

427
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:52,190
its many more more things of course but
it's essentially no web server

428
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,270
a dynamic DNS server curb risk ATC

429
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:59,100
a file server and a DC or PC

430
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:03,449
services it's all those things but the
main thing it has

431
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:07,789
is a central data store and that's
that's very important

432
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:11,039
and that's that's what actually a.m.

433
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:15,570
that's what actually drove a lot of the
design decisions in creating some before

434
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:21,230
so okay there's all those five things
right see you got OpenLDAP

435
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:25,409
that year old observer you've got behind
that CDNs

436
00:25:25,409 --> 00:25:29,000
other you've got MIT and on the curb
Rhys choose one

437
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,580
educate EC's then actually got the open
group DC source code to this year the

438
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,408
CrPC

439
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:38,779
and sambar I'm cassese's par so we just

440
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:42,850
integrated those all together and we
were done right

441
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:46,240
well so there was a proprietary product
calls add

442
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,820
from a guy look how it is very very
clever guy now living in Berlin

443
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:54,230
I playing music a.m. he did that

444
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:58,090
I'm lotta work did a wonderful job we
the

445
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:03,918
choose a different path

446
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,970
a said ok we

447
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:10,450
I yeah we we created all our own code
for

448
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:14,529
every single one other subsystems so we
haven't held up server

449
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:17,960
we have our own DNS server

450
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,440
we have our own KTC embedded in SM we
already had

451
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,220
and we didn't is that the CrPC killed
anyone I feel happy about

452
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,799
is not using the DC points is the Open
Group D COPC code

453
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:36,480
just that coat sucks I and it was never
properly security audited

454
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,529
there'd be many other products that use
the I think Apple uses it

455
00:26:39,529 --> 00:26:42,950
in that in there version

456
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:46,429
I said an SMB to serve a SMB wants me to
serve a

457
00:26:46,429 --> 00:26:51,390
I don't trust that code it was basically
it's all proprietary code got thrown

458
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,289
over the wall about five years ago

459
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:57,580
nobody to my knowledge it in a security
odiaun it nobody's in a review the

460
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:02,549
I don't recycle I there's probably
horace looking in that that we will be

461
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:03,770
seeing CV's

462
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:07,220
the next 10 years on you know if anyone
actually

463
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:10,220
goes into its I i'm I'm happy that we
ended up using our own

464
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:15,320
that but for the rest well why do we do
it

465
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,960
why did we do it so the new single
really good reason this not one

466
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,850
thingy or one personal one thing you can
point to and say it's their fault they

467
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:24,350
did it

468
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:27,370
that's why we did it the most

469
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:32,090
common issue the the thing that was
brought up the most

470
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:36,070
that ended up getting us to do this was
the need for

471
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:40,470
a common data store and it's hard to
coordinate

472
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:46,360
the back-end data storage for all those
different products into one place

473
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,090
I'm remember Active Directory requires

474
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:54,199
the you can set a password I L that and
read it but the CE

475
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,200
or data password biker breasts and then

476
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,039
you know have it enforced by all the
other subsystems

477
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:06,970
Ackles magically appear when you create
objects and inheritance has to work when

478
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:09,700
you create objects inside the old up
database

479
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,039
so it's not just a matter of saying most
Italy's products together

480
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,740
and you have all the pieces you need
it's much more complex than that

481
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:21,440
sad had the luxury basically shipping
modified

482
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,669
custom versions all these things stitch
together into

483
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:27,700
a product we didn't have that luxury we
would have had to

484
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,899
upstream everything and that was not so
easy

485
00:28:31,899 --> 00:28:37,158
on so more reasons

486
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:41,080
suit rage how many people here note rage

487
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,889
okay so so I am you not be ninety
recently sees kinda semi-retired

488
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:50,899
but if you don't reach was once listed
as the smartest man in Australia

489
00:28:50,899 --> 00:28:54,309
actually believe that and he's a really
smart passive

490
00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:57,370
Samba sow to deny it credited with
creating sambar

491
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:00,799
but anyone has talked to both his nose
that one of them is smart and one of

492
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:01,889
them is me

493
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:05,210
so trage spent

494
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,950
and I'm not gonna name the subsystems
book in development in some before

495
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:13,960
he actually spent a week trying to get
two components to work together

496
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,149
I will say that cryptography was
involved just to give you heads

497
00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:21,279
he managed to make it work it took

498
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:26,820
him a week to figure out what versions
would bill with what libraries to make

499
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,270
the things actually work and at that
point

500
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:34,320
he realized week you know even if we
have

501
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,970
and I don't know how many do we hear
CMOS talked yesterday

502
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:41,610
cemented a wonderful talk an SSD but he
pointed out

503
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:45,620
that in order to configure the things
that you need to for free IPA I think it

504
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:45,979
was

505
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:49,890
you have ninety six separate steps you
have to do

506
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:53,279
to integrate all these pieces you can
expect

507
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:57,590
happens to do that I mean if it would be
like saying he has some before and then

508
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:02,760
a pending a box of LEGO bricks a little
fluency yet to build it yourself its see

509
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,830
I am so actually

510
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:10,120
building some those pieces that sells
meant that we could

511
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:14,168
actually ensure the those things were
integrated

512
00:30:14,169 --> 00:30:18,450
I'm although it does kinda suck a.m.

513
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:21,970
so we need to make invasive changes in
upstream product projects

514
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:25,760
that we weren't necessarily sure would
be welcome at the time

515
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,429
so Microsoft made specific changes to
curb Ross

516
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:33,169
to embed what they call a privilege
authentication certificate

517
00:30:33,169 --> 00:30:36,620
in the tickets that they were generating
so that men

518
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,789
up three changes to compress to embed
window seats

519
00:30:39,789 --> 00:30:43,919
into you know standard MIT your I know
KTC

520
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,220
and you know quite rightly those guys
would say well where we gonna get them

521
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:48,669
from

522
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:52,390
why do we need them and Booker of
basically

523
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:56,159
where's the sambar for version of it
which is actually a copy of the Heimdall

524
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:56,820
source

525
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:02,389
and imported in December week we can
create those transparently is needed

526
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:06,429
and the other thing that took a while to
realize is that we didn't know what we

527
00:31:06,429 --> 00:31:07,919
didn't know

528
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,110
so there was a lot of experimentation
that was done

529
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:14,168
to figure out what changes were needed

530
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:20,049
so yes we probably could have done this
using the external projects

531
00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:23,510
it would have been harder we would
probably still be working on it

532
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:28,129
whether that was a wise choice in all
time we'll time we'll see

533
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:31,380
um and finally you know

534
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,669
we have we want to create something that
aliens can at least

535
00:31:34,669 --> 00:31:38,580
download install and set up with the
minimal sauce

536
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:42,399
and we want to be able to test
everything

537
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,600
so having to say well we work with this
they should have opened up because we

538
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,408
tested it but if they updated it may
break things that we don't know

539
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:54,090
it's very hard to test the whole system
as a coherent consistent

540
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:58,809
whole which if you going to replace
something as complex as Active Directory

541
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:02,779
you really need to be able to have a
testing framework

542
00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:06,309
that will test the entire system I am

543
00:32:06,309 --> 00:32:10,149
and the other nice things the other
ex-con a side effect

544
00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:13,649
is that having this embedded blog Samba
for

545
00:32:13,649 --> 00:32:17,439
that's in AD domain controller it allows
other projects

546
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,909
to essentially use owes the components
without them having to reproduce all the

547
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:24,240
steps that setting up these things
separately

548
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,500
and so open change which is what

549
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:31,149
allows Outlook clients to work
transparently against latex

550
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:34,949
UNIX servers I using all that the native
protocol

551
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:38,080
rather than having to install plugins
that

552
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,590
need some before as an 80 domain
controller and that

553
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:44,760
two-week collaborate closely with that
project I'm

554
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,830
they they essentially uses as part of
that

555
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:50,949
configuration and that actually works
really well

556
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:56,039
so now now we have something that's out
there that works

557
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,629
theoretically we could revisit this

558
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:02,830
and start doing the work upstream all
the changes we need

559
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:07,110
in the various different product
projects and to get everything together

560
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:10,269
so that we can use the existing
components

561
00:33:10,269 --> 00:33:13,320
it's gonna be a lot of work and so

562
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,980
you know if anyone is really interested
and has time to start looking at this

563
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,700
problem

564
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,269
I would very much welcome people to come
along and help us do that

565
00:33:22,269 --> 00:33:25,470
I'm the Samba team is probably

566
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:29,570
at its maximum 10 to 15 really active
developers

567
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:33,510
minimum between five and ten and right
now

568
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:36,929
just keeping this model it's running is
big enough

569
00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:40,899
is hard enough work we don't really have
the time we have a budget at the time

570
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:41,729
with us a thing to do

571
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:48,730
yes question

572
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:56,970
so the question is do we have code that
will synchronize

573
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:01,220
existing open El Cap with the Sam hell
that at no we do not

574
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,779
we will synchronize and replicate with
Active Directory

575
00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:09,739
because we used the Microsoft direct
replication protocols which will be /c

576
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:13,388
a pc-based you would have to explore
things in El death

577
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:17,129
you would have to make sure the scheme
as much and then you could be important

578
00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:21,168
into sambar that would be the way you
have to do it but no we do not have

579
00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:23,129
currently have to go to do that does
that

580
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:27,250
what's your question yet so such good
would be very welcome

581
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:34,250
I yes another question what version of
the standard

582
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:40,109
mmm

583
00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:44,440
sorry with the

584
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,690
her

585
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:52,200
you have multi master

586
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:56,460
okay

587
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:00,630
so the question was what version
unveiled ap are you implementing

588
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,980
are you implementing a master-slave or

589
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:07,960
multi master so I don't think that's
actually change in the over

590
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,030
protocol on the wire past talking about
a change in

591
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:14,569
in the actual open elder code itself so

592
00:35:14,569 --> 00:35:18,170
I'm gonna horribly sty sidestepped the
question by saying

593
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:21,400
we do what Windows does it Sep

594
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,810
so weak we implement the standard that
Microsoft has

595
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:28,779
because that's the standard that we have
to create in order for their clients to

596
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,319
work

597
00:35:29,319 --> 00:35:33,180
so it kinda that so I

598
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:36,859
a goal is to have multi muster
replication in exactly the same way the

599
00:35:36,859 --> 00:35:37,799
Windows does it

600
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,589
which is almost certainly completely
incompatible with the way open elder

601
00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:42,099
said

602
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:46,280
would be like answer to that one some
sorry that sucks but thats

603
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,319
your remember a goal is to make seamless
interoperability with Windows

604
00:35:50,319 --> 00:35:53,640
and so that's what we have to do so

605
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,859
a new hope we may be able to do new
things

606
00:35:56,859 --> 00:36:01,569
so right now we have a bunch you we
Emnes who ship file server products

607
00:36:01,569 --> 00:36:04,970
what I'm really hoping to do and if
there are people here

608
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:08,709
interested in creating such products I'd
love to talk to you or email me a very

609
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,730
easy to find I am

610
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:15,859
it would be very nice if people thought
about creating directory services

611
00:36:15,859 --> 00:36:17,779
products based on top of this cold

612
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:21,290
so a small business server would be an
excellent

613
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:25,029
in a small business authentication
server I'm

614
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:29,069
you know back-end campus back into cloud
applications

615
00:36:29,069 --> 00:36:32,750
there are many many things you can do
with this code I

616
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:36,450
and I would really love to help build
and ecosystem

617
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:39,890
we ends we're building product out at
the eighty

618
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:44,368
controller in some before so I and
that's that's kinda hope at the moment

619
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:44,660
we

620
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:49,160
we have we have one not to vendors who
are doing this on a small scale

621
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,609
I would love to see someone like Cisco
or something like that pick it up and I

622
00:36:52,609 --> 00:36:53,290
i thinkI

623
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:56,529
might be very useful for them am

624
00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:00,550
so but hurry up a little I am

625
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:05,349
also for improvements as I mentioned all
a fast pass I always now completely

626
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:06,230
asynchronous

627
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:10,700
I am and we can keep this the systems
pretty busy

628
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:15,270
the core the code is as I say a big
state machine

629
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:19,040
I said SMB three

630
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,690
now includes transport level encryption
and as Microsoft actually did a really

631
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:25,770
good job of designing SMB three

632
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:29,720
in that they allow you to turn on very
specific features

633
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,078
individually but when they were doing
SMB one

634
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:37,109
all the features will mingle together so
if you all of a sudden you said you

635
00:37:37,109 --> 00:37:38,359
supported one feature

636
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:41,619
the clients with then start doing a
whole host of other features so you

637
00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:44,040
couldn't separate out the pieces you can
implement

638
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:48,009
cleanly with SMB three diff actually fix
that you can pick

639
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:51,250
I'm gonna do encryption this week I'm
gonna do you know

640
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:54,460
durable handles next week you can
actually

641
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:58,970
specified by negotiated bits the
speeches at the protocol that you will

642
00:37:58,970 --> 00:37:59,560
implement

643
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,380
and the client's obey that so we now
have transport leveling friction

644
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,990
that actually a as an aside quite a
funny story

645
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:11,839
that basically the reason that got put
in there the microsoft engineers with

646
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:13,000
very very happy

647
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,250
that's amber Pour transport leveling
friction into SMB wall

648
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:22,869
which we did have for a while I own
fortunes to the limit skill engineers

649
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:25,960
useless as they are never bother to
implement in the

650
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,940
in this its plant in the cable but we
had transport level encryption at the

651
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,819
S&P last for a long time

652
00:38:31,819 --> 00:38:35,270
and apparently the mike is a third-year
always wanted to put this

653
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:39,520
inside Windows but the security people
would never let them do it

654
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,440
said oh I P sec now and forever is the
way to do proper encryption

655
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,580
but the fact that we had in Samba enable
them to

656
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:49,980
leverage with their marketing people and
say all those guys have it we have to

657
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,640
have it too

658
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,500
so they actually finally put transport
level encryption SBC which is a very

659
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,670
good thing

660
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:00,730
because as as into you know no package
should go the networking group said

661
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:04,810
I am with added support for the new
handle tight

662
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:08,029
I'm you think the other thing that we
split them into whiz

663
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:12,170
I'm treats Boca and some of the other
somebody members

664
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:16,790
created a clustered distributed database
cool CTB

665
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:21,500
which was used for the basis up the
scale that's onassis' Kayla aspirin from

666
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,430
IBM

667
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:25,569
and that allowed transparent clustering

668
00:39:25,569 --> 00:39:28,700
to multiple nodes which is something
that Microsoft SMB server

669
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,450
never did so this is a brand new thing
that was working with Windows

670
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:36,359
lines I'm and so as in creating SMB
three

671
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:40,089
Microsoft raise the bar and of course it
was easy for them to do so because they

672
00:39:40,089 --> 00:39:40,880
have control

673
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,740
the client code so the change the client
code to actually make

674
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:48,759
failover multi-path and a bunch of other
enhancements

675
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,790
I'm to SMB clustering and of course
we've been doing lots of work on

676
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:56,609
scalability and performance which is
still ongoing

677
00:39:56,609 --> 00:40:00,869
so the passover is actually quite nice
in in in some before

678
00:40:00,869 --> 00:40:04,339
I am and and so we we've actually done
some

679
00:40:04,339 --> 00:40:07,540
process improvements as well how many
people here

680
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:12,470
work on free software projects that have
mandatory code review

681
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:18,220
not that many well I mean having worked
inside large organizations

682
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:21,970
creating software man difficult review
ease

683
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:25,000
where we're going and you really need to
get

684
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,359
in terms of quality at least trickle
bases largest Sammy it is the

685
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:33,310
only way you will keep that thing
working without breaking

686
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:37,750
and moving forward so if you're not be
mandatory code review now

687
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:41,230
think about it please plan 3 it's a
process improvement

688
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:45,150
that you really really need to be
thinking about I am

689
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:49,650
nOCO changes going to any release
without Bugzilla report

690
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:54,380
sign up by two engineers on the patch
and hopefully regression test case to

691
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:54,930
going

692
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:59,450
to fix it as well to to make sure that
we have regressed

693
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:02,609
every single commit goes into the code
base

694
00:41:02,609 --> 00:41:06,759
has a make full make test run against it
which tests

695
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,380
as many things as we can including
creating a new active back to main

696
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,390
controller during replication

697
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:16,970
doing file activity to it filling in for
doing a full regression test suite doing

698
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:18,379
all the locking tests

699
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:22,880
all that has to pass every single commit

700
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,010
I and then we also use I mean I must
admit we look in this because they've

701
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,790
given it to its the free

702
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:32,720
casework accountable well-known project
but we have automated

703
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,560
scanners and foes is running against urs
all the time

704
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,140
and so this is one of the reasons that

705
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:43,868
week we we pasqua verities a.m.

706
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:47,299
wrong to certification for security or
whatever you think you have to do of

707
00:41:47,299 --> 00:41:48,250
course is one those

708
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:51,660
guys did you report says you have to
read them and fix the box

709
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:54,859
I'll lot of projects get reports the
don't actually do anything with them

710
00:41:54,859 --> 00:41:58,210
week tend to treat those things the very
high priority

711
00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:01,460
so responding to reports getting

712
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:06,829
code forces and scan is running at your
code is a very very good thing

713
00:42:06,829 --> 00:42:12,020
so but a very little I relations with
Microsoft

714
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:15,230
so I don't know whether anyone read the
summer for

715
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:19,099
20 press release but we actually had a
quote

716
00:42:19,099 --> 00:42:22,910
goodall Thomas from the direct route
development

717
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:27,129
a Windows Server now he's not actually
producing some the form each

718
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:31,319
in with trying his best to buy me is
marketing people don't let it go so far

719
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:35,369
you know he's he's praising the fact
that their interoperability labs helped

720
00:42:35,369 --> 00:42:35,940
us develop

721
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:39,580
which is true absolutely true well

722
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:43,790
the idea getting an official quote from
Microsoft

723
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:47,430
for a free software release I mean I'm
just

724
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:50,730
staggered by that especially as the most
time

725
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:53,830
in the past I've been to Brussels more
often

726
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:57,529
the lawsuits that I have the false cell

727
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:01,260
so the change in in getting up from
Microsoft I think he's

728
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:04,830
very positive very helpful I

729
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:09,040
and on an engineering basis

730
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,580
you know essentially every year we hang
out at the Red Robin in Redmond

731
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:17,220
eating burgers together so from an
engineering point of view weekend with

732
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,629
Microsoft extremely well

733
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:22,040
we still have a little trouble with
their legal marketing people sometimes

734
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,160
hopefully that will hopefully that will
change

735
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:29,140
I so yes I i'm I'm actually quite
positive and confident about that things

736
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:29,790
are getting

737
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:34,210
really going really well so

738
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:37,339
what could go wrong what really worries
me

739
00:43:37,339 --> 00:43:41,279
and that's just to such a wonderful
quote because they really are inside the

740
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,030
code and they're gonna get is

741
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:46,460
I so

742
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:49,710
there are things that worry me about the
future sambar and you know I'm gonna be

743
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,619
honest and I'm gonna

744
00:43:50,619 --> 00:43:53,859
help with those so

745
00:43:53,859 --> 00:43:57,310
this POSIX on the edge it is it going pp

746
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:00,520
and this summer running well beyond it
going

747
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:03,880
looking for the Acme parachute which we
know is gonna work

748
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,980
on we now have requirements

749
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,980
the way way beyond the filesystems a

750
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:14,310
that limits and POSIX will provide we
need

751
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:17,410
durable handles we need direct releasing
handles

752
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:21,348
these are actually some of the same
things that NFS v4 needs

753
00:44:21,349 --> 00:44:24,880
but he sensually were out there in the
wild chopping down

754
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,660
you know the on the brush to try and
clear away to get some standards

755
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:32,368
working on minutes because these are the
things

756
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:37,990
the filesystems and you know proprietary
enterprise solutions a selling to people

757
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:41,520
and so we have to have those two limits
has to have those things

758
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:46,740
you know filesystems enterprise storage
we have to have this level

759
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:50,589
failover reliability I'm right now %uh
standards

760
00:44:50,589 --> 00:44:55,119
just don't cut it and it's hard to get
new things into Linux kernel and of

761
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:56,940
course the other theories that

762
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:01,020
you know this is going of the age and
standing there the back is BST

763
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:04,529
because they haven't implemented some
things that limits as we don't want to

764
00:45:04,529 --> 00:45:09,240
become a limits on the project

765
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:12,669
complexity I am

766
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:16,599
its complicated now the

767
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:20,839
now if tritch were if trick him into
retirement that might then be one person

768
00:45:20,839 --> 00:45:21,830
who understood the

769
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:26,098
and coat fully but without that this
just shows a bunch of guys

770
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:31,160
and it's too complex for any one person
to fully understand

771
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:35,589
I mean I am feel less I will put books
into any part of the code in San

772
00:45:35,589 --> 00:45:38,810
right but I don't always know what I'm
doing

773
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:42,349
I'm confident the file server I would be
very pushed

774
00:45:42,349 --> 00:45:47,240
to fix bugs in the 80 control or
something the old

775
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:52,040
so we need more people to work in a we
need more subject matter specialists we

776
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,569
need more experts in various areas that
the code

777
00:45:54,569 --> 00:45:58,440
it's a complicated beast now

778
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:03,109
I and it's getting bigger and that of
course

779
00:46:03,109 --> 00:46:06,598
II gonna leave yet a little time to read
this probably the best deal but I've

780
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:10,400
I've read in a very long time

781
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,049
together we can strangle innovation and
plans to the lies Asian back into the

782
00:46:14,049 --> 00:46:14,920
dark ages

783
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:18,000
a better description a software patents
I have yet to read

784
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,369
I am so of course this is a problem for
all software

785
00:46:22,369 --> 00:46:28,690
but particularly free software because
echoed is out there and people can see

786
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:31,910
and I don't leave notice

787
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:35,240
but a war has started or begun the
patent wars

788
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:40,160
to do my own impression I they've all
started so each other

789
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,569
and and you know any free software
project

790
00:46:43,569 --> 00:46:47,190
could end up as collateral damage in
this really really

791
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:50,700
ugly war that's going on between the
Giants

792
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:54,009
I and you know

793
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:57,490
remember a corporation as Simon fits
wants marvelously said

794
00:46:57,490 --> 00:47:01,310
Yukon argue ethics for the corporation
is like talking to adult

795
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:04,990
you know corporation is machine machine
for making money it doesn't understand

796
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:06,580
right or wrong

797
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:09,470
there's only the people with any and if
they do something that doesn't make the

798
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:12,009
corporation enough money they get
replaced

799
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:15,080
so software patents just

800
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:18,380
terrible terrible idea and you know

801
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:23,180
us dog but club Lee points out we
complain civilization into the dark ages

802
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:24,049
so we do

803
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:27,279
we do have a choice on that I'm

804
00:47:27,279 --> 00:47:31,049
you know we're doing this to ourselves
and maybe I should be back to the people

805
00:47:31,049 --> 00:47:34,660
in the legal tract can listen to this
part

806
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:38,129
and I think I finish perfectly on time
woohoo so

807
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:45,130
yes question

808
00:47:45,349 --> 00:47:49,279
some third party software needs scheme
extensions

809
00:47:49,279 --> 00:47:52,779
ido Spartans on some for sorry some

810
00:47:52,779 --> 00:47:56,349
third party software needs a scheme
extensions like

811
00:47:56,349 --> 00:47:59,470
a ninety territory yes I believe you can
do that you can

812
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:04,200
you can update the schema in Samba 40
directory see more grammy from wrong but

813
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:09,000
yes cell a.m. please any Windows
software that works against Active

814
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:09,599
Directory

815
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,859
please tested and some before if it
doesn't work it's a bug

816
00:48:12,859 --> 00:48:19,859
and we have to work on it any other
questions

817
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:29,230
I i'm out to sea world is still possible
to have a open album

818
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:33,610
back and forth a son before so so the
question is is it still possible to have

819
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,450
an open now but back in for some before

820
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:38,830
no I'm sorry it's not as i as i
mentioned

821
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:43,430
before that essentially would have been
the integration peace

822
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:46,799
I and we would have needed many changes
in the open all that back and

823
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,900
now I would like us to be able to do
that

824
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:54,020
but that is its as I said something that
right now we don't have budget staffing

825
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,250
or time for sale

826
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:58,730
if people are interested in that I would
love to work with you can tell that

827
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:00,150
people to make that happen

828
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:03,380
but I don't have the time to do that
okay and

829
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:08,360
one what one person I think the Dons i'm
suppose you're in the

830
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:12,030
mixed environment using Microsoft an
open source products

831
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:15,980
and yours slowed replacing the Microsoft
products by

832
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:20,370
some %uh products up and eventually you
find yourself in a completely open sores

833
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:21,190
environments

834
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:24,460
the hot just using Samba what with the
value be

835
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:28,930
in keep using Samba at that point
instead of replacing it with something

836
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:29,299
that's

837
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,720
may be better suited what certainly does
it all invitees

838
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,069
when the virus is taken over the host
you still need the virus

839
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:40,240
I know that's a good way to put it
absolutely no

840
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,140
once you have a completely free and open
infrastructure

841
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:47,339
I using proprietary and we have the
complex

842
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:51,390
very in some protocols is probably a bad
idea and you should probably minutes to

843
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:52,549
standards-based once

844
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:57,740
good look alright without I think I bet
if any sam ran out of time

845
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:59,000
thank you so much for listening
