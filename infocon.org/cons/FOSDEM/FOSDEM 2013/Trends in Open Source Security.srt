1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,330
I'm going to talk about

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,480
three main areas: 10 voted tracking how

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,000
we can offer loss distribution all of
himself well

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,099
track while blankets in the upstream
stop its ships

5
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:18,310
I then about to change hardening and

6
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,409
final part about this occasion I picked

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,550
paperless a nice so

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,650
liability tracking these days all

9
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:34,269
all major Linux distributions a
city-based CV

10
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:38,680
come on abilities and expose health the
project started by mitre

11
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,960
and did aims to SRM

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,410
a unique identifiers to happy publicly
disclose

13
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,980
liability I'll

14
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,129
I've put up I

15
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:56,789
example 'cause Watson identify fiftieth
CV

16
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,730
dash the year dash ok increasing number
within that

17
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:07,090
your on the TV project doesn't

18
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:12,170
create a taxonomy it's more like but
bringing in the sense that

19
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,890
a on it poses put on

20
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:20,810
they're going through numbers on
electric boat so they can track them

21
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,500
CV is I am tax

22
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,240
identifying vulnerabilities in concrete
software products

23
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,750
in concrete versions not about Jan all

24
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,920
on Liberty classics like overflow
exploits

25
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,920
possible up um what happens these basis
that CVS Pharmacy other

26
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:46,658
distributions because anybody can
download out

27
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:51,520
the CV data buyers all like this website
and you can see okay

28
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,729
compared to yesterday there have been
these

29
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:58,200
identify fired and then you can start
processing

30
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,700
issue 1 abilities that works very well

31
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,960
for public issues and

32
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,019
we actually happened and mailing list

33
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,770
one by open wall called always a
security

34
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:16,410
where r right half court i feed what's
this

35
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,770
at this time I'll

36
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,980
CV identifiers for as the

37
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,030
request but coming for assignment so
that

38
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,879
the

39
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,018
a a wondering if that happened

40
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:38,250
have received your CV identified yet

41
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,580
catwalk there are also many identifiers

42
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,290
assigned by vendors

43
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,810
who have their own pool with so they can

44
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,360
put on a CV identify our

45
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,010
when they believe the security adviser
without coordinating with anyone

46
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,280
the cabi he identifies of have

47
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,650
Left Banke a public descriptions so we
don't really know all

48
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,489
what that %uh powered about for yes a

49
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:10,690
identify further fired through the open
process

50
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:15,819
court it's very diligent and making sure
that the

51
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:18,920
I'll one abilities

52
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,809
are precisely described so that we
actually can do is this I don't

53
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:27,470
feels like light all so how

54
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,680
do we them your status

55
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,620
identifies we have to poet

56
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,230
the identify relation to the software we
ship

57
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,459
and those the first aspect if the
package

58
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:44,730
we have time identify that

59
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,879
which packages affected and

60
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:51,709
for each bronze we ship we can

61
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:55,040
fifth the notably mini Olympics

62
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,530
version when you winner picks the
partners this if the

63
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,730
an approach with based on version based
politics pecking

64
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,129
on first I wanted to present a

65
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:10,679
a the ultimate approached on a ball hit
tracking

66
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,900
but it turns out that I have

67
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,699
forgotten that it's really really
complicated in some corner cases

68
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:22,150
to make this work cell

69
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:26,289
a that in this doing this for fall

70
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:30,340
for the unstable failed distributions

71
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,690
and we have learned over the years

72
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,020
that it if really complicated

73
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,460
a to cap all eventualities

74
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,380
but it North fostered works for you

75
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,090
well to some extent I'll

76
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,630
everything version based partly typing
with the

77
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,630
tighter version numbering scheme and
branch mortal soul

78
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,850
you cannot we use studying

79
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:02,550
versus version numbers on going to law

80
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,530
even on officers of it or that that's
not going to work

81
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:10,239
so here's an example from

82
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,970
Fantasy VIII before that for father GN

83
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,280
program ramps which is related to John
Wall

84
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,758
passing you have a list yet another
Markup Language Center task the

85
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:26,090
a are aspect that it's a superset

86
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,448
of Jason and XML the silent our

87
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:32,449
same time and the Ruby

88
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:36,160
program last year's the annual pass for
to her

89
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,900
pass the XML anti-sniping

90
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,219
and there were

91
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,310
upon about this for the animals for all
of us

92
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,820
that's comparable to PHP Sun serialized
all

93
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,830
highs think or or or

94
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,000
stall and the fact they wanted your

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,759
see allies and I'm Trafford object yeah
almost almost guaranteed to have

96
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,389
arbitrary code execution because down
all

97
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:10,560
dethier updates irritation effective

98
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,030
arbitrary objects and you don't want to
do this for fun

99
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:17,909
with the data so years in exile perform

100
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:22,720
a dead end person tracking database

101
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,400
and I'm just concentrating on their
intentions

102
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,560
so for the unstable Broncos

103
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,270
for sprees table release

104
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:39,590
are disgrace really is hah have pretty
effed and

105
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,630
security update so

106
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:46,479
that was a subsequent security opted

107
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,599
this one aren't we

108
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,759
it it's on the same bra I'm so we know
that is pics

109
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,680
by comparing it with prime specific

110
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,729
fixed version on for the on fix russians

111
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:05,889
we have I

112
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:09,639
and older were rushing from testing that

113
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:13,410
that war for and and testing on fable

114
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,750
before ob are cross

115
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,949
fixed and years in older version prong

116
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:24,590
the Squidbillies Ron which predated the
pics were

117
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:29,818
and the very thing thing that is that
the

118
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:33,470
this data can be used to rate install
packages

119
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:37,900
on the system's sorry can use this data
to see if it

120
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:44,900
your cup all abilities on your system
are

121
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:49,590
the other approach for viability
tracking

122
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:54,270
that probably use by both other
distributions

123
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,849
just fire truck a box in your
backtracked up

124
00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:01,270
I that wat red-headed doing

125
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:04,530
adore hand

126
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:09,039
the supported products basically

127
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,900
the Securities response team created for
track and back and back to the top

128
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,289
better

129
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:18,000
Kong which is the area to the city

130
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,610
ir this trackback will be made I'll pick
up

131
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:25,160
disclosure best also extended

132
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,449
meta-data and the white portion of that

133
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:32,430
Park which is all publicly accessible

134
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:35,958
this talk about dependence on
product-specific back

135
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:39,289
usually you can only see though this

136
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:42,870
forfeit or not for the

137
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,610
the internal internal fire parked car

138
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,630
didn't I don't like about for Paul B
Enterprise Products up

139
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,970
officially Nepal not public yet sorry
accessible what got that

140
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,269
today information and that officially
not interesting

141
00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:03,180
so what happens when you blow to the
head or are using

142
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,540
you're alone for track a pixel about
profit or if that

143
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:13,040
adopted sister actually expected
expression information into

144
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,709
I filled up so you have to

145
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:20,209
a single player at all this is quite
different

146
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:23,219
phone version based tracking

147
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:28,950
by a the pontiff conceptually much
simpler all

148
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,279
and it came cover any case because here
at all

149
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:36,630
actually after compare version on I saw

150
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,760
University numbering scheme is totally
strange

151
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,950
X perfect record bags Stone cover it

152
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,700
so the if the same

153
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,160
by Liberty are and

154
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,170
pretty up the slack to available

155
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:59,729
web page working look at the

156
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,930
preference but they are the you our

157
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:06,390
Paul his perceive each I got back you
could

158
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,720
actually put the CD name

159
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,420
behind the eye people signed with for
work because the

160
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,189
here and

161
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,760
the I the

162
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,390
for dog checking back to public and
there aren't all bikes for

163
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,890
the enterprise products which also
affected by responsibility and

164
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,949
the eighth Enterprise Products

165
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:35,930
retires or were eventually fixed
authorities security atwater's

166
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:39,300
that eventually there obviously there's
a lot of hard to manage

167
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:46,300
automation for this to working with

168
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,790
so I believe that you're going to Jan 20

169
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,060
this is a sera similar schemes

170
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,518
all for Volvo the tracking

171
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:59,750
and the good thing is that no such thing
products

172
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,000
provide critical information to to go

173
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,899
Paul this thought of about 30 tracking

174
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,820
they have there are impact and a
analysis under

175
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,930
country description of the viability in
the security adviser

176
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:18,459
or end up back to back up

177
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:21,989
and they offering to individual patches
or commit

178
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,670
thing Kate or like a real repositories

179
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:28,829
the takes specific

180
00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:32,959
all abilities so I'll

181
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,260
we need as a necessary addition we need
these

182
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,790
individual patches to be able to

183
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:43,930
to for Best Picture Day updates because
we don't want to

184
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,229
bill ponder months all I'm related
development

185
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:53,190
work well for security update because
too much could

186
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:58,000
so if we don't have that information we
have to reverse engineer it

187
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,170
fall ta bort

188
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:06,370
we could die download from form for your
website

189
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,459
this times continue already have done
this

190
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:12,540
work I

191
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,870
we would like to spend time on precious
you are testing

192
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:20,529
for at the you know if this official we
were always

193
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:24,320
system repute I selected security
patches

194
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,760
I'll make it quite with the whole

195
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,670
feel fixing because I that's just how

196
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:34,699
we propel the updates I and

197
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:39,120
some of the analysis also on on the pop
it was a security alert for

198
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,399
by hiding this information you have out

199
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,800
much security advantages so

200
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,800
the the important thing

201
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,389
here is that we

202
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:57,839
oh sorry a we really want to have

203
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,190
have a real one thing patch upstream to
made

204
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,589
available individual commit

205
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:07,630
public person control repository so that

206
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:12,680
the security fixes can be prepare a
timely manner

207
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,479
so one thing that

208
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,490
comes up at this point is how can we
improve

209
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:24,029
cross distribution information sharing
at this part

210
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:27,439
I'll one thing that annoying all

211
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,910
just a fact of life is to passing
schemes that package

212
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,639
to her gravely between different
disappears even though

213
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,940
we are shipped Firefox on the somewhere

214
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:45,029
worshipped a sissy ship a we ship Apache
httpd

215
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:50,820
had yet the names of packages all a bit
different and we also

216
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,050
inchoate the upstream version and
different ways into all

217
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:59,939
worsening skiers but

218
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,639
I think and abstracts and CV two
packages

219
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:06,800
nothing could be shared I'll

220
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,670
that's a separate project for that all

221
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:14,050
follows call a pic to caught come on

222
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:17,189
by Paul enumeration but offer for

223
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,779
martyr I am this marks

224
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:24,649
a actress s meet in the middle point

225
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:29,320
well both the distributions care see
okay this city

226
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,130
I'll applies to this

227
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:38,290
see PE and on packages to the CP

228
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:42,599
such insights and this shit like this
initial mapping step

229
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,910
his ear but a up on that

230
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:51,469
I really difficult to

231
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:55,300
to to heartened by versioning

232
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,699
part of this whole what is the pics of
him version looks like a

233
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:05,290
this information with really hard to to
automated

234
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,360
by again please publish a security
patches

235
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:15,339
a pic except publicly accessible version
control repository a separate comments 0

236
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:18,850
this is something we as I think
exhibitions we've ever

237
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,709
you tremendously a would like to

238
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:27,660
think house to keep it that way it's not
a trend that bind us thank our

239
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,399
away from publishing

240
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:34,870
individual patches Bob the past

241
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:38,560
bill a few project the fact that have

242
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,589
have always operated by releasing

243
00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:44,810
complete tar balls which can obtain
unrelated

244
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:48,829
unrelated development and not just
security fixes

245
00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:51,989
and of course there are some products

246
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:55,320
that go from

247
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,160
supper at part of theater to toppers

248
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,569
to distribution we all hope to

249
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:06,630
distract that that this turns into
tracked all

250
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,000
I cause for problem for us for poor

251
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,709
preparing security updates

252
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:17,209
so that it for

253
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:20,569
wanna busy tracking

254
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:24,110
the next part is to change hardening

255
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:27,860
are basically there that's about
changing decency

256
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,259
be injured feels the car on all its the

257
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:34,600
everything that bela lives you know

258
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,970
most programs running

259
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,589
grueling hours the

260
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:45,990
a change that to reduce the impact of
security fall

261
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:52,240
boat its well as the fifth
countermeasures up power this day

262
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,250
kinda messed up again code execution

263
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,740
that means that thats AlwaysOn non-zero

264
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,449
all ability that an attack goes who
because this run in SF

265
00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:06,409
involved if the attacker or guesses
correctly

266
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,589
it going a its going to

267
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:13,079
rethought holding situation and

268
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:17,329
the economist at here onto to

269
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:21,599
Diff'rent areas wanna aspect is

270
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:26,688
we tried to may care more difficult for
the attack at

271
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:30,970
right the specific memory location

272
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:34,870
that is I'll

273
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:39,299
at that affect the program's control
flow so

274
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:42,660
on it should not be

275
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,929
easy to redirect execution because

276
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:49,350
I the memory location is not

277
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:53,090
either likable at all oil difficult to
locate and

278
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:58,049
program and the other aspect is that we
want to make it more difficult

279
00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:01,289
to pride

280
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:05,530
about you that have some meaning Paul
impact

281
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:09,950
Paul for the program being attacked all
a

282
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:13,500
so that it doesn't saw the crash but %uh
something more interesting for the

283
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,960
attack a

284
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,710
and it's important to keep in mind that
these

285
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:23,570
are not complete solutions

286
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,629
what we do is we make the program
crashed

287
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:30,030
the countermeasures effector I'll

288
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:33,030
code is not executed about it so I crash

289
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:36,600
is back obviously still need fixing have
just

290
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:41,049
something that might be lower priority
but

291
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:47,110
it's still something we actually want to
fix at some point

292
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:50,659
so these Peter

293
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,570
mention on on this page up

294
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:59,620
I'll mostly enabled by default just

295
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:04,229
if he is chasity on and to attain

296
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:08,120
the first point this address space
layout randomization that

297
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:13,070
me arduous shell ivory saw their
position

298
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:17,239
the outer space it thought it was a
perspective to analyze the starter

299
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:20,779
if it's Brenda Myers this makes it more
difficult to

300
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:23,980
to find spaces to writer

301
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,230
predictable fashion and a

302
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:32,210
also makes it more difficult to cared
about financial pointed to code

303
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:38,399
shot largely because the after that
there's another aspect

304
00:19:38,399 --> 00:19:42,570
about program started dresses

305
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:46,239
aren't going to cover that net than the
next

306
00:19:46,239 --> 00:19:49,889
think that you get as it is for free yes
nonexistent

307
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:54,119
double stacked keep it that means that

308
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:57,449
or when the attacker supplies Co to your
program

309
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,879
and its stall he'd I

310
00:20:00,879 --> 00:20:03,988
it it is not directly execute all

311
00:20:03,989 --> 00:20:07,309
coffee haven't got the executed it

312
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:10,769
the pass protection for that means I saw

313
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:13,799
Harper support or

314
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:18,779

generally available

317
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,850
there office I'm

318
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:34,428
from time ago author being sorry yes I
know if that

319
00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:39,259
we have pigs juleps the soul that
toppled theme parks were here

320
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:42,950
yeah look at this time pointwise do not

321
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,399
we saw them

322
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:52,580
in a park that started it Bible for code
execution or defend your place and

check their do it see that detector

325
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,769
such targets portation attacks then
there's

326
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:06,480
aspect protector that about protecting
the return address

327
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,950
on the stack so that affect a scuffle

328
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:13,399
know that almost that override the
return address

329
00:21:13,399 --> 00:21:17,918
also bribes or write to us to carry

330
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,690
to carry their is its check before
returning home

331
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:26,179
function if it has the expected value if
it hasn't we

332
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:29,499
assume it has been over Britain by an
attack on top of a program

333
00:21:29,499 --> 00:21:32,499
this character you have to know where

334
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:36,419
explicitly barred most distributions a

335
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:40,950
tree 50/50 defaults in a way that this
is always active

336
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:45,549
when Park programs than there are
additional compile warnings

337
00:21:45,549 --> 00:21:50,190
for formspring miscues some
distributions turn back to us

338
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:54,600
either doing boat or a separate step by

339
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,399
examined both locks and the warning to
CS written

340
00:21:58,399 --> 00:22:01,619
and also warnings about

341
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:04,749
such cases of integer overflow

342
00:22:04,749 --> 00:22:08,960
that trade undefined is your walk

343
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,539
you what at that that landed in case
ASEAN last

344
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:18,809
Wallace operator Aremu heartening for c
plus plus programs

345
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:21,918
they used to be in really old part a

346
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,499
disclosed in 2002 which

347
00:22:25,499 --> 00:22:29,159
a as a means to if allocate a lot

348
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:32,740
array using gcc

349
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:36,879
and operating here it could happen that
the value

350
00:22:36,879 --> 00:22:39,949
wrapped around internally and want to
get back

351
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:43,169
from for on the sea prime-time lottery

352
00:22:43,169 --> 00:22:47,029
is just as the very small this morning
people are

353
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:50,359
and then use of lighting into the area
and together

354
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:53,570
he based buffer overflow are

355
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:56,720
this has been fixed and discipline for

356
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,960
by a which is cool coming under
development

357
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,980
I it's always active doesn't know where
to turn it off

358
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,480
and for

359
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,480
patch has all ready the impact or to
trade or 18

360
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,950
so federating in Farah

361
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:18,840
18 most critical patches packages have
been rebuild

362
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,908
a chasity and the pics fired

363
00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:26,279
but that the the unfortunate thing
aspect of this property is

364
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:30,230
that effing code generated by GCC

365
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:34,980
so you have to recompile everything that
mike is this

366
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:39,070
the above plus functionality and a

367
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:42,749
before that you still have let exposure

368
00:23:42,749 --> 00:23:48,090
responsibility but it's going to be
fixed and

369
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:52,349
this issue 4 horner's it's going to be
released papal

370
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:56,460
way I think so for it

371
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:02,299
just pick up to but Potter Petra Kvitova
so another thing

372
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:05,740
about to attend harming this is
completely optional but many

373
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,539
distributions

374
00:24:06,539 --> 00:24:10,379
a lattice called 45 false the

375
00:24:10,379 --> 00:24:14,939
think very neat aspect is the first

376
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:19,480
either cooperation between GCC and g++
look-see

377
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,669
pcca uses car provide to compile a whole

378
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:28,710
and with way K put in a pointer about
point over RF information

379
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:33,230
and GCC uses contact from the program
source code it sees

380
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:37,240
to infer plank of the IRA are

381
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,879
military contacts rappers that power of
banks information effective

382
00:24:41,879 --> 00:24:45,199
available always deliver help us to

383
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,279
Rep fortunes which performing checks

384
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:51,899
so what you get area

385
00:24:51,899 --> 00:24:56,289
your have I'll

386
00:24:56,289 --> 00:25:00,820
to have stack-based buffer overflows
which

387
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:05,099
I reliable assault in crashes because

388
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:08,710
collector tactic their entire the
program

389
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:12,320
for the of all of law actually occurs

390
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,399
pad community is that the

391
00:25:15,399 --> 00:25:19,570
disabled person and write a home in
Springs

392
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:24,039
have to fortify source mall used to be a
backpack

393
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:28,919
this has been fixed at perfect point

394
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:32,849
the this enables dissolves

395
00:25:32,849 --> 00:25:35,859
for its being attacked the use person

396
00:25:35,859 --> 00:25:38,949
had for writing

397
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:43,269
data control fresh

398
00:25:43,269 --> 00:25:47,089
so not everything

399
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:51,070
a is we we don't know all

400
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:55,939
I'll hardening opportunities of
functionality that

401
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,399
is readily available to change right now

402
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:03,959
for instance the one thing that would
how

403
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,990
which is on the sample way a stricken
rid of 32-bit architecture

404
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:13,099
because 32-bit

405
00:26:13,099 --> 00:26:16,619
32-bit Jeff to that all

406
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:19,720
a content to too little entropy

407
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,839
to cared for randomization

408
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:25,879
at predictable the bed addresses

409
00:26:25,879 --> 00:26:30,289
or shell Rd addresses I'll

410
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:34,799
that's also the another aspect because
size t a 64-bit

411
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,720
and 64-bit architectures

412
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,849
yup you often have I

413
00:26:42,849 --> 00:26:47,289
integer overflow of that with other a
whole host which are only of exploit a

414
00:26:47,289 --> 00:26:49,869
longer trip to a bit architect just
because

415
00:26:49,869 --> 00:26:53,119
on 64-bit architecture modification is

416
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:57,389
for in 64-bit just as in all of law

417
00:26:57,389 --> 00:27:02,189
there so Canada 32-bit

418
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:05,269
once that that's going to happen
eventually

419
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:09,159
I'll will help us somewhat this area

420
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:13,269
another thing at actually pretty easy to
do but

421
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:17,230
adoro for example has indicted
developing pulling

422
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:21,499
disabled at Earth space layout with
renovation because

423
00:27:21,499 --> 00:27:24,549
it picks a thing of fixed-line you know
that

424
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:27,960
is valid I'm takin one

425
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,690
to erectile on the system so it's not

426
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:35,169
I'll entirely predictable still

427
00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:39,389
all works quite well I guess that were
based attacked welfare

428
00:27:39,389 --> 00:27:42,498
about whether it had a sissy the

429
00:27:42,499 --> 00:27:46,089
addresses on the local system but

430
00:27:46,089 --> 00:27:49,819
it doesn't work again loca attackers can
just

431
00:27:49,819 --> 00:27:55,470
track what are the address issues of
this system by peeling

432
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:58,710
use the disinformation for a

433
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:02,829
further attacks what we should do

434
00:28:02,829 --> 00:28:06,918
is randomization of programs thought
address with pat is 1.3

435
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:10,839
do not pulley what we do not put in
randomized

436
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:14,730
a executed pages India in the process

437
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:19,369
ms basically or process a stop address

438
00:28:19,369 --> 00:28:23,178
I'll were for

439
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:26,490
we're just so for a couple of zeros

440
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:29,490
that the constant the fears

441
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:32,829
the the actual program

442
00:28:32,829 --> 00:28:36,200
self-contained now machine code

443
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,710
to provide targets for guitar and

444
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:43,250
programming so to is the potential all

445
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:48,960
up address space layout randomization by
Pastor

446
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,519
this hasn't been implemented because
there is a concern for

447
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:56,569
overhead a a proper a ps3

448
00:28:56,569 --> 00:29:00,928
it outside palace isn't it looks like we
should be lied to this

449
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:05,240
had inhabited for everything and not
just critical network South

450
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:10,369
like open SSH that another thing we can
do which is

451
00:29:10,369 --> 00:29:14,418
readily available is by now that's

452
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:19,019
I feature all the idea so dynamic linker

453
00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:22,889
deconstruct the link up here

454
00:29:22,889 --> 00:29:26,639
perform all simple resolution

455
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:29,740
at program start and and a

456
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,740
kick your butt off the table dollar

457
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,829
with mean the lolol

458
00:29:35,829 --> 00:29:39,690
of the Taylor cannot be overridden by
attackers because it has a starting

459
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,460
point for my offerings

460
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:46,359
Paris really important here a

461
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:49,849
get this protection or you also can do
mock

462
00:29:49,849 --> 00:29:54,189
which doesn't seem to what's on the
radar is

463
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:57,409
we could cope i laughing package for

464
00:29:57,409 --> 00:30:03,329
have crappy with banks and itself
causing see deterministic using

465
00:30:03,329 --> 00:30:06,349
to complement its aromatic

466
00:30:06,349 --> 00:30:12,710
are I at this only helps problem
programs which years

467
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:16,679
incorrect ways for all for checking NCRC
puff puff

468
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:20,500
soul it's not really compelling to it
now that

469
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,940
cusick interferes will optimization

470
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,369
up maybe we have to buy power have a
better

471
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:31,019
as well the next point there

472
00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:35,659
that also partying Jesus he has been for
a while

473
00:30:35,659 --> 00:30:40,109
bath at spectacular STEC taking

474
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:44,579
are that appall I'll

475
00:30:44,579 --> 00:30:48,369
sectors a whole flowers horse perfect
point I love

476
00:30:48,369 --> 00:30:51,759
I'm relation to restarting Paul I don't

477
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:55,829
loka call all

478
00:30:55,829 --> 00:31:00,069
Bible and array location almost there

479
00:31:00,069 --> 00:31:03,879
I think what happens is that

480
00:31:03,879 --> 00:31:07,849
I quarter and okay with a lot argument

481
00:31:07,849 --> 00:31:11,939
of the stack pointer from within the are
located

482
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:16,250
stay completely outside just back where
anything can happen

483
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:19,379
most of the time there was going to be a
crash pad

484
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:22,480
it's conceivable that this is exploit
want

485
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,200
I think it has been too demonstrated
recently that

486
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:31,259
this things carry we thought an
arbitrary code execution

487
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:35,069
the stage right now is that s sector

488
00:31:35,069 --> 00:31:39,210
hath comfortable or outside

489
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:42,990
impact because every cause instrumented
even though the spectra

490
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:46,619
small and doesn't contain Alexa call for

491
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:49,949
we really me too

492
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:53,000
work on that I happy

493
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,309
cut ties in back down time we can start
looking at

494
00:31:56,309 --> 00:32:00,190
I before them back and wanted to arm

495
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:03,329
as a backup plan there the

496
00:32:03,329 --> 00:32:08,369
px occurred current approach a bar which
by

497
00:32:08,369 --> 00:32:12,849
I'll probe values on

498
00:32:12,849 --> 00:32:17,019
in a sequence on the stack and hopes to
reach got paged

499
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:20,579
on I la jolla and which were killed

500
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:24,879
process I'll if this approach with the
loop and bill

501
00:32:24,879 --> 00:32:27,889
although writing us too expensive for

502
00:32:27,889 --> 00:32:31,990
I don't care we have have a poor
background we

503
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:35,079
all he could think boundaries provided
by but

504
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:39,460
stacked without actually an album but
thanks we would only use the stick

505
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,579
expect our readers

506
00:32:40,579 --> 00:32:43,859
his personal attacks I'll

507
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:47,259
to detector

508
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:50,970
that we have to close to their topple
perspective for Paul

509
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:54,279
Alexa allocation request

510
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:57,819
II hope that we will be able to

511
00:32:57,819 --> 00:33:01,990
tackle this problem this year because
there's so much code altogether

512
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:05,129
with Alexa so far

513
00:33:05,129 --> 00:33:09,549
a tad to 22 discourage its use have

514
00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:13,249
here receive by program that's because
they like it

515
00:33:13,249 --> 00:33:17,169
it's an easy and effective don't have to
coffee I like Baloch

516
00:33:17,169 --> 00:33:20,499
but a

517
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:24,559
it up if they have a security risk and
so we have to fix it

518
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:29,139
should check one thing that I'd like to

519
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:33,008
see fixed as well as sucks just checking
checking for

520
00:33:33,009 --> 00:33:37,759
operator brackets and

521
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:43,740
see pulp that effect than a vector
standard springer spaniel right

522
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:47,119
so if you use the shot notation

523
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:50,970
it's basically and they have pretty lips
see per

524
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:54,069
this chasity it if the safest see

525
00:33:54,069 --> 00:33:58,319
necessary programs because there's no
wage setting even though the runtime are

526
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:59,149
reno's

527
00:33:59,149 --> 00:34:02,289
all along the IRS and couldn't stop

528
00:34:02,289 --> 00:34:06,079
the size checks a hazardous fun for Java
or

529
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:10,469
pie all many other programming languages

530
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:13,980
with a proper standard all actually give
permission to do this

531
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:17,230
check I'll but

532
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:20,409
we tried to make the

533
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:23,879
change politely and implemented and it
seemed to have

534
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:28,429
performance impact on tired saw we had
to

535
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:33,349
up put it on the backbone of picked off
an hour

536
00:34:33,349 --> 00:34:36,460
a I think that percentage research
needed whole

537
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,799
character K address this and

538
00:34:39,799 --> 00:34:43,119
in the meantime receipt of past program
want to start

539
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,509
sup scripture you have to use the at

540
00:34:46,509 --> 00:34:49,879
member function which is the same St

541
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:53,109
first trip to operate up pops it's
required

542
00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:57,339
to perform the substructure tech

543
00:34:57,339 --> 00:35:02,450
so this is something where we still have
to do some work Frank

544
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:06,308
so one aspect that

545
00:35:06,309 --> 00:35:09,430
Maxit difficult

546
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:13,348
for of to talking about it's harming
fetuses

547
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:17,009
that we have to decide how much
performance impact we

548
00:35:17,009 --> 00:35:20,740
want to take in order to

549
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:24,270
interest security hand

550
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:27,690
1 I'm trying to show years we have

551
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:31,089
on a countermeasure that we implement

552
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:34,240
and and the damage just

553
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,348
space I'm changed I and

554
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:40,740
now we keep our and effective
countermeasure and

555
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:44,750
the damage we met for comment extra
measure goes way down

556
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:48,380
and then company attack and goes up a
problem with that is

557
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:53,020
we like paint on detective attacks about
large-scale

558
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:56,049
a because

559
00:35:56,049 --> 00:35:59,140
we County on to target

560
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:02,759
in the face that are

561
00:36:02,759 --> 00:36:07,230
I'll won't be different if Parker had
also asked the

562
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:10,809
Java plugin obviously but fortunately of
the kinda what up

563
00:36:10,809 --> 00:36:14,160
horoscope for alright that then we would
have these

564
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,310
this data available what changed to make
and what changes

565
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:21,460
a we see in

566
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,370
a tactic for by

567
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:26,509
I got this data makes it very difficult
to

568
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:29,970
I'll a

569
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:33,189
jobs security

570
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,380
country from the two attended objective
way

571
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:40,510
for your victory krikalev of things we
could do

572
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:44,650
we feel that we are all 12 make things

573
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:48,890
com a to take it to a new level I'll

574
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:51,950
there are some things we can do to seize
the puck past that

575
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:57,140
probably I change the language quite a
lot

576
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,580
I week while

577
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:04,000
always stand up for so it's a very long
time

578
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,270
project

579
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:11,220
I'm not sure if if that's going to
happen anytime soon

580
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:15,859
and equally unrealistic this live free
consultation

581
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:19,850
the that

582
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:23,509
a failing that should

583
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:28,900
have box unlikely to materialise I think

584
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,450
most Linux distributions ship for

585
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,730
5 different implementations of SSH

586
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:39,700
and that Soundway that

587
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,980
for conflict ripped or a

588
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:47,570
protocol that's not going to helped
bring down securely box

589
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:52,450
one thing that might help us plus
specific secure carting

590
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:55,560
the car according to guidelines there
have been a couple

591
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,330
up books about secure coding by David

592
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:02,630
usually do not address

593
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:06,460
the morning at Snead and our

594
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,760
pretty much out of date by also

595
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,030
will probably have to revive that and

596
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:16,230
eventually all this for

597
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:19,330
I experience we gained

598
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:23,840
profit from robert is documenting risky
live recalls

599
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,650
show Albany fully to bed I API said

600
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:31,740
point also all along tell I have cost

601
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:36,319
we can go completely crazy and rewrite
everything in a different programming

602
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:36,960
language

603
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,800
and curiously that's not going

604
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,700
it completely on practical right now
because or something new system

605
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,850
programming

606
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:50,060
hard tough not deeply about over

607
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:54,720
sense that we can replace coding lottery
and the calling

608
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,359
program doesn't notice that it's no
longer

609
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:02,760
see part rust for example netscape
security sucks it sloppy

610
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,850
could eventually use Ross or
implementing critical functionality

611
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:11,130
about right now me though that anger to
think that

612
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:14,960
a that many alleged qualify for this
kind of data

613
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,830
batting I'll and a test probably not

614
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:22,180
at to everyone's taste buds had

615
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:27,899
there are tremendous there's a
tremendous amount of tools available for

616
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,900
a DUP

617
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,960
which help to both secure software apps

618
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,440
bishop to look into that more and I S II
has a

619
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,710
a Church following

620
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,910
all a problemas foster saw

621
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:46,410
why it's going to be interesting a

622
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:49,899
so wire final Topinka

623
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,970
distribution white effect on analysis

624
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:56,080
are

625
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,340
missus a about

626
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:05,020
using tools to find properties across
the whole distribution

627
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:09,320
Island what I did for preparing the
slightest

628
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:14,240
so me rare a proprietary aesthetic and
I'll

629
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,330
analyzer on all

630
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:21,710
change I had to them Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 6

631
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:25,620
which were released into the hall well a

632
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:31,819
we'd looked at the changes reported by
the static and now have

633
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:35,250
that interstate effect in life reported

634
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:39,550
a huge number of potential issues and we
looked at

635
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:43,040
the before or after

636
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,200
state for each have reported Park

637
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,330
and power interesting

638
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:54,270
interesting on actual matches for
viability

639
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:57,560
where and box we have fixed then

640
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:02,180
I'll we have fixed their

641
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:05,600
at and rata during 2012

642
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,190
on the first one is that real security
bach the other one

643
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:12,740
square regular box in the first one
actually was

644
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,950
caught by by the

645
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:19,490
a 45 sauce of a checking logic because

646
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:22,490
did he have thought of it so instead a

647
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:26,689
analyze and implement it so something

648
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:31,460
we should gather more data on it and
that affect our project

649
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:37,340
if the URL which I i still gotta all
kinds of information about

650
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:41,140
a open sauce

651
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:45,290
static analysis tools so we can use
their

652
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:48,370
inferred or and actually

653
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:51,540
treat them so that day

654
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,560
matched closely to the API's use and

655
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:59,170
provide us with good information about
our code

656
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:02,670
one thing that I find very interesting
is

657
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:06,700
matching machines in humans

658
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:10,689
and coupling their

659
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:15,470
different skill set one thing that you
can do it you can take a

660
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:20,240
search engine what actually is happening
right now a lot

661
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,000
and search for certain para

662
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,730
and that manually go through the hit

663
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:33,440
and identify potential security issues
that are

664
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,320
related to the search thing for example
the Ruby on Rails

665
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,790
what a pity I mentioned earlier a

666
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:44,410
could be located im

667
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:48,620
using this a string this could point to
code copies that

668
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:52,009
have civil or on politics

669
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:56,200
bytecode search engines are sort of
difficult to set up so

670
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,990
a mentioned and lie nato myself

671
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:04,950
I have Britain index of 40

672
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:08,700
tell someone database with for how
simple that I said I think it will be to

673
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,529
me

674
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:12,920
a I'm paying RPM packages

675
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,440
pipe them through and al pols or

676
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:20,240
and no a retard Center pasqua quote that
applies

677
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,819
I dad have

678
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:28,340
really interesting applications you can
use before par

679
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:32,610
pass press car driver and he joins to
you is

680
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:36,590
and you stand to find lobbed a recall of
that

681
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:41,350
are highly likely to be Obama budget
violet to specific

682
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:44,569
I'll attacks like a

683
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:47,910
you know the first example earth up
Forex play

684
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:51,000
are caller X amount of a create

685
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,850
but do not mistake to entity expansion
using them as an entity that will handle

686
00:43:56,850 --> 00:44:00,740
this means to a small XML file a
doughnut hole than that

687
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:04,850
can blow up in your process into what'd
you go by

688
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:08,450
I'll Xmas what

689
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:12,020
are you or this one is pretty
complicated

690
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:15,930
can be implemented and ask you know you
can implementing

691
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:19,390
dynamic link all what all the time but
not dynamic linker

692
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:23,190
using recursive various and hospice well

693
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:26,820
than you care by in securing uses of cat
and fall

694
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:29,950
power and SS themselves

695
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:34,540
bitch what your thoughts that the

696
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:39,120
I this is something that could lead to a
privilege escalation because

697
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:43,640
the the want to know the palm 120 the
ss12

698
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:47,060
catron I'll privilege process

699
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:51,759
shot such as sq or possibly

700
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,070
so I think for governor and as we could

701
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:59,230
too much more we have better tools

702
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:02,970
okay just keep talking formation for

703
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:07,540
something we could do is we could
actually passed compiled code

704
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:12,840
and I expect further information fund is
a family

705
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:16,620
and it would be nice to cover additional
languages and put that everything or

706
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:17,410
just like pie

707
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:21,670
or PHP Paul are her is 62

708
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:25,700
cather good information about

709
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:30,370
the factions which appear in court by
programs

710
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:33,710
so what I hope to have eventually s

711
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:38,610
to have combined yes on both its simple
data base

712
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:42,270
well something that go through to binary

713
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:45,390
expects function arguments for example

714
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:49,790
actors that to buy the day tempted to
discover

715
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:54,240
sup types of are apparently it's like a

716
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,549
I'm thank you lasting demands or

717
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:01,140
expect accent accidentally disabled SSL

718
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:04,870
certificate validation hollow

719
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:08,440
I for last point it's about power max

720
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,570
a box because PowerMax actually

721
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:15,290
hard limit on the North had

722
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:18,509
we could use the app simple database
assigned next to the Cape

723
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:24,040
interesting points had yes this assembly
to extract function argument

724
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,210
actually fine whole the score reliable

725
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:30,880
I'll so

726
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,590
that's it for me on

727
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:38,210
song I think into things you should take
homeless

728
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:42,100
weenie should try to fix allocate this
year

729
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:45,470
I static analysis and code search

730
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:50,290
search engines are exciting and please
share your version control repository

731
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:55,480
so that we can use that to profess
acadia

732
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:02,480
okay that for me if there are any
questions

733
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,200
on since the there is

734
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,259
not so much time there are there is time
for just

735
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:25,260
to questions to anybody

736
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,320
is there any question white

737
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:35,640
who

738
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:36,469
okay then thank you
