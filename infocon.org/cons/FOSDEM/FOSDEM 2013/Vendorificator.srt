1
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:03,570
so

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,898
lol my name is much and I want to do a
quick shower and demo of

3
00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:11,300
small utility that I have

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,910
just open source towards us Justin
tenderly very because I put their

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:22,910
0.1 version today it is called vendors
educator and I don't know if you are

6
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,029
familiar with the discussions

7
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:29,220
named vendor everything it is point of
view that

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,488
if you have a project you should keep
all your dependencies

9
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:38,250
together in the same repository to be
independent of charge no authority

10
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,250
pulling the source of lying to be
independent of

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,770
Robbie James breaking to be independent
of

12
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:49,239
pipe I being offline which happens

13
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:54,459
way too often and so on and two may
agree or disagree

14
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,629
are agree partially about to it's worth

15
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:02,320
moving the discussion and vendors
secretaries have told that to

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,040
works with git to make possible to not
on the Inc Lord

17
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,740
the vendor or upstream sources but also
make it possible to keep track of

18
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,610
it keep track of what pieces do you have
where they came from

19
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,740
the in which versions and

20
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,100
what are the local changes because they
are always local changes

21
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:28,100
it works only with gate it is written in
Ruby so it is available as a ruby gem

22
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,950
it works by creating pristine

23
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,369
orphan Browns for all the upstream
modulus

24
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,090
which means that every module has its
branch

25
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,880
which is on the then merged into master
or whatever branch work on

26
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,100
which also means you always have a whole
list of modules you always have

27
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,880
de France between wat was or should I
download

28
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,079
and what you work with and so on and if
you

29
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,610
ever go through or and a startup
acquisition are any

30
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,640
license compliance audit their auditors
will thank you for that

31
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,590
so

32
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,099
to get started at installed
undereducated RAM

33
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:14,379
in it gets repository and

34
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:17,730
the main configuration listen the
so-called vendor file

35
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:22,290
or if you don't want to clutter or
directory just invent context lash

36
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,489
and RB Antron endorsing

37
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:29,430
to synchronize to download the now the

38
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,150
Quique de Moor position how it's looks
that Coke works

39
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,190
it's an example vendor file

40
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,989
it gets pop culture Google Books I don't
want

41
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:46,790
all the dependencies sir just some I
want to download virtual and for Python

42
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:47,299
on

43
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,660
sample books and something forget

44
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:55,620
this bit customized it is not a simplest
example bob

45
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,030
it shows that it rocks were third
various kind of upstream modules that it

46
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:00,280
is

47
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:05,849
extensive boy just how capable and let's
see what can we do with that

48
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:09,390
when we try to look at the state us

49
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,488
we see that there are some new modules
and that

50
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:16,980
met today to offer cool of travel books

51
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,200
cannot be read so it cannot figure out
the dependences

52
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,540
let's try to SEnuke

53
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,420
that the and a right now

54
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,929
this is not a live demo because right
now the vendor educator award download

55
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,000
a lot of stuff and it takes a while but
8

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,090
downloads all the specified modules and
their dependencies

57
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,440
and after that we can see the state owes
that

58
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,620
everything is up-to-date in clouding the

59
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:53,920
dependences including the call box that
the ones that we specified

60
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,958
depend on we can see that for every
module for every don't know that piece

61
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:00,860
of software

62
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:06,159
a separate branch has been created a
separate

63
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,298
tagged in it has been created for every
version or download

64
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:14,459
and we can see that

65
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:18,019
the branches are orphan they don't

66
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:21,430
inherit from muster they include only

67
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:26,550
the pristine pure upstream source which
also makes it easy to emerge from their

68
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,630
pristine brown trust

69
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,530
different branches of your a project
without

70
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,770
running the risk accidentally emerging
in Psalm changes of

71
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,299
your own called

72
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,979
and we can see that inventor
subdirectory

73
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:48,389
all kinds of stuff has been downloaded
and

74
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:51,490
I don't like the the the trial and

75
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,100
beats I want to edit it I want to

76
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:59,360
have only some of the files not all of
them not all supports groups and so on

77
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,940
does the documentation and a the main
python script

78
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,900
their arses clatter so I changed the
vendor file

79
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,638
I can always add a block call the block
to edit

80
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,030
whatever was no no doubt

81
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,080
I also upgrade the version at

82
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,250
the Schwan or whatever to let under a
ticket or no

83
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:29,250
that it has been changed

84
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:34,180
and in the stages our sports the

85
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,150
we can see it is this one is outdated

86
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,638
when we think the outdated model is now
know that it is

87
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,720
always even difficult to and download
something unjust

88
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,669
always download it from scratch into an
empty directory:

89
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:54,500
no incremental downloads no s you mean
that everything is the same

90
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,870
to be sure that what was don't know that
is

91
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,300
clean original ups themselves

92
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,009
has been downloaded unpacked tagged

93
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:09,690
as previously and we can see that

94
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,740
carl s files i'd didn't

95
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,310
folder taxing screenshot but a new
attack also has been

96
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,990
crater there

97
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:24,970
and a in the log we can see that

98
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:29,229
in the pristine the change walls
introduce into the pristine branch

99
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:33,370
with a new tag and merged again into
master

100
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:37,569
so all the changes in models all the
upgrades all the updates

101
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:41,080
work on the same person branch which
means if you

102
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,430
operate and dependency goal from

103
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,440
virtual and one point age to 1.91 is

104
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,910
when it is released you also have a
clear difference

105
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,090
of Wat happened between the previous
version used

106
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:59,869
and the current version and issue
introduced any local changers

107
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:04,160
bullying a new version is nothing more
than a

108
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:10,150
get March the if you have conflicts you
will have to resolve it box

109
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:15,120
in I don't think it gets any easier

110
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,449
and the evander educator also supports
keeping track of local changes

111
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:26,330
for a test I have for changed introduced
a single line change a single command

112
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,568
and I can Ron vendor def

113
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:33,180
the and it shows me a gift DF again de
France

114
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,639
the for all the branches that are

115
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:42,539
that half any changers between current
works three and the pristine branch

116
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:47,610
I can see wat exactly I have changed how
exactly I have diverged from

117
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,960
upstream I can view the same as a

118
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,520
get a log of changes that are on my
branch but are not

119
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,758
on the pristine branch and this is also
good

120
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:03,810
tool review and keep track of your local
updates after a local purchase of

121
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:07,669
for wat can be

122
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:11,849
and enoch work with open source some of
the changes you may

123
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:16,889
wont sometimes to Porsche to the Arjan
authority

124
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:21,039
talking about open source if you work on
a single branch

125
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,280
you want keep track of it it will be
hard to untangle

126
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:29,198
display you keep all the change issue or

127
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,469
and you also stay accountable to whoever
reviews if you're

128
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:38,190
okay without a license on the model or
not

129
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:41,320
so that would be it

130
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,140
now is def five minutes for questions I
suppose and a

131
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:53,140
other and then

132
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,709
the question was how it works with John
file actually

133
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:12,560
to be honest I don't use it with Japan's
for this if I want to vendor are you

134
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,420
lose a bundle cash from gym

135
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,670
for John file and I don't think it

136
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:21,719
could be integrated at on the other hand
if you will

137
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,029
who wants to have some a really cost all
murder i'm for example you copy it from

138
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:30,990
deter from an under these branch and
then at on top of it at your own

139
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,060
modifications

140
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,339
you can just added to vendor file have
it in directory

141
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:39,839
and point to Jeff I to that directory
this will

142
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:46,839
this will also work

143
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:55,720
okay

144
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:02,720
I guess that's it than thank you
