1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,000
popular I'm height remains their goal

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,109
I am programmer at Facebook here talk to
back it up

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,460
we written about for years ago
introducing

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,980
Cup for the first time and a few things
have changed in that space

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,869
I how many viewers here three years ago
few

6
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:23,920
okay I'm medium you at least have an
idea of what the copiers

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,960
whining and you probably around

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,540
I hip-hop event came out three years ago

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,879
was a PHP to ship was placed

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,550
translator in which is kinda sharp
enough to make I was a bit flow

11
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,290
for Chanel work it completely changes
come by product anymore

12
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,300
it only bears the name in common no in
from

13
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,849
pipe so let's get into it talk about it
a little bit

14
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,809
in CHEM I'll tell you what's wrong with
it because there are few things to wrong

15
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:55,199
with it

16
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,449
factor hopefully its 2.8 maybe from you
want to try it out

17
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:02,659
I'm get involved shark commit to think
back

18
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:06,119
are are open first picture was kinda
broken for a while but we're trying to

19
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:06,960
improve their

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,320
so moving on on this you can be

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,509
you know what we're going to talk about
today are why to pop in here

22
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:18,390
roughly how work and a

23
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,450
are you sure should be using it so
problem we had a facebook

24
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,740
is backed we've got now a few

25
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,570
few years ago we had a few hundred
million users we had asked few thousand

26
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:31,869
servers we had

27
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:34,950
are a lotta traffic moving and

28
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,290
while running the tunnel and stack like
most sites here

29
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:43,230
got next patch in my fickle PHP fairness
is running pretty well PHP is a good

30
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,000
platform

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,480
its can run bad code pretty decently

32
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,370
American really good code pre Wow
affectionately

33
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:56,930
asistir to scale out too far you start
reading some problem venture anyone

34
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:57,960
who's gone past

35
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,679
doesn't servers has started to see from
these problems your data beef

36
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,670
you're going to start disagree with each
other a little bear yet buildings

37
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,190
special cashing rares

38
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:10,699
your befriending service start to get
memory locked because

39
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:15,399
if you're in PHP and Apache you're gonna
be running in pre-foreclosure

40
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,799
it doesn't really quite working we're
committed to our on

41
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:23,459
page piece not current meant to be
threaded so

42
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,360
where do you get you make your servers
run a little bit better

43
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,110
and be. if things to do or go for
locating for

44
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,310
make your databases work rate and that
can get you

45
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,459
that you actually prove me right off the
bat machine too many web sites that

46
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,849
arc on their knees because for me to try
to be needed

47
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:46,409
index every single field every single
combination feel adding some random

48
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:49,679
me wonder why the right stick short
that's why

49
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,819
and so I'm single for the easy stuff

50
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:57,048
you know don't try to redefine your
entire system take baby steps

51
00:02:57,049 --> 00:03:00,870
working on that when he left

52
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,430
well in our case we had done all those
looking for it we've done

53
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,989
all those places where we can improve
are stackable

54
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:14,060
now PHP staking out you know some sixty
percent of our execution time

55
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:19,469
can we speed up that sixty percent so
that is a small portion

56
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:22,918
got the idea for hip

57
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:26,379
on now hip-hop like this that has gone
through

58
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:29,719
a few iterations in its time honor

59
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:32,840
where we're at right near ok

60
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,389
backers for I we're at right now is
we're actually taking source code

61
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:42,049
comparing that to bytecode from which
the way PHP actually does it

62
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:45,840
we are running at my code in a virtual
machine

63
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,519
future released here make sure thing
understand how things work together

64
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:56,299
and then at the very last minute we do a
a translation to native code

65
00:03:56,299 --> 00:04:02,659
should attack Iran at full speed we've
also removed actually finish picture

66
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:06,209
we don't really need to remove actually
since we have now

67
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:09,980
replaced PHP with something that's
roughly credit environment

68
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,948
with Instagram top worker it could work
just fine by

69
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:17,109
for our purposes would it need only
actually

70
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:20,849
and actually brings capaci the big Swiss
Army knife sticking to everything

71
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:24,600
I'm gonna catch you don't get me wrong
I'm but it's more

72
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,760
we then we necessarily for Facebook so
we were placed back

73
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,180
with HTTP server based on weather event
it's very lean

74
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:37,090
very quick moving forward to today

75
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,260
were actually thinking could be foreseen
a little bit

76
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,960
we're going to expand happy around a bit
sandwich what PHP

77
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,180
so you can use Apache two with eight you
can use proxy Jan which a

78
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,849
sorta web server start a proxy server
that we've developed in-house or not

79
00:04:52,849 --> 00:04:53,340
tear

80
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,409
open source that on YouTube using when
the pentagon

81
00:04:56,409 --> 00:05:00,469
you have to it or on after the Giants
the fourth when it's kinda minor

82
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:05,360
our list of things to to get out quickly
between could prolly plug it into

83
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,840
you white or any other Terry already

84
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,169
for shorter

85
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:15,960
the problem that haircuts trace all and

86
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,099
why you know we think it does a pretty
good job solving it

87
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:23,229
we're back up a bit and talk about them
in history

88
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:26,889
there are 4

89
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:31,639
interpretations a hip the first one the
one that we introduced

90
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,349
three years ago costume is called each
peach PC that is the

91
00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:38,930
pick up compiler that so when it takes
at source code says

92
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,120
Alicia PHP looks a lot like seeing let's
shift

93
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,740
translate that instruction for
instruction pattern of to make

94
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,280
after it compiles we get a big big year
for binary

95
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,159
after those web server does all the work
it's fantastic for three in

96
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:58,819
Facebook dot com for about three years
up until

97
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:02,879
actually last month we just retired

98
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,340
the trouble with this is not every time
we do production push

99
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,780
it takes a barrel 40 minutes across two
hundred machines

100
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,250
to actually cook heil I love our baghdad

101
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,379
I'm this is horribly painful it's
something that's completely untenable

102
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:22,099
in development mode UK if you have one
machine it's gonna take

103
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:25,289
given their forty times 100 4,000

104
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:31,438
a long time it's completely unrealistic
for development

105
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:34,909
so we left our developing machines used
running what we call ape

106
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:38,629
the Apache PHP environment and it works
fine accept their number

107
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:42,210
quite identical rate got a PHP in with
you gotta

108
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:47,128
pick up on the other side maybe the
functions are implemented slightly

109
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:49,800
differently maybe there's some functions
there 11

110
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,379
art from the other we've got a few
language extensions we added generators

111
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:57,909
are up two years ago we had something
called

112
00:06:57,909 --> 00:07:02,000
X HP which for your little bit more
later ambitious

113
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,819
very fantastic output layer

114
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:10,120
but it means that our governments don't
quite match a

115
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,949
although we can create their pursue
extension the PHP to

116
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:18,340
pick a picture hip-hop features and we
can try to make it up close

117
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,679
as quickly as possible doesn't quite
work answer

118
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,629
if the conflict so we threw together HP
HP I'm

119
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:29,280
which is hip-hop in interpretive night

120
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,039
this basically followed the PHP to style
the

121
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,620
script execution which years but look at
all I'm

122
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,710
figure out what want review detection in
the next morning figure it out to you

123
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,378
that instruction

124
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:47,090
as for your pre compiling no intelligent
caching up to code its

125
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,060
with the release while it probably read
about a quarter speechwriter a PHP

126
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,530
but at least it was mostly consistent
with that significant systematic

127
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:03,530
term is a painful but with current
governor for development machine

128
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:08,610
we've also got be HP HP debugger on this
is sort of a command line interface is

129
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,280
current firmware to PHP dash

130
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,138
a be contract did not reach me but it
got a few extra things

131
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:17,400
it's basically got GV be turning on
topic you can

132
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,060
attached to you or anyone page on your
server set breakpoints watchers

133
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,629
and analyze what your codes doing when
you

134
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:29,080
bring up HP treaty election little are
your source code

135
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,539
secrets are calling functions adding you
mean my briefings

136
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:36,098
and you can contract which actual
condition

137
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,460
very quickly measly

138
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,680
think some people actually come this a
lot more convenient than writing code is

139
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:46,810
actually running on the page

140
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:51,449
a year ago we got are most recent
version of hip-hop

141
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,370
up to the point where it was ready to be
used are not machines tonight

142
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,040
if HH p.m. this

143
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,150
functions a little bit more closely to
the php5 style

144
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,540
code execution we takes source code

145
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:10,480
the compound out to biker cashes in a
daily from where

146
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,550
on page comes up to be viewed we're in
those bankers

147
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:17,020
through a I runtime: interpreter

148
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,890
this is late missile a pitch behind that
if you look at an engine that

149
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,949
and where about our teachers our
performance with

150
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:28,530
just Bagh p.m. verses PHP

151
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,910
so a complainer rate play not

152
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,780
is wheat relationship on topic actually
burn

153
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:39,870
our code it returns we say okay we know
where the code is likely to go we know

154
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,670
what all the time

155
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:45,949
involved are likely to be which are
comparing match x86 cat

156
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:50,660
we run hehe I'm with jet not only are we
competitive with hate speech BC

157
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,430
actually that ten percent faster than it
is not mean

158
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:59,819
about a morning her up to 6x improvement
over PHP

159
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,910
now that a wide range that's because it
depends on how you write your code

160
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:08,520
no tucker a little bit more about that
in a moment

161
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,090
we also had a additional

162
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:15,930
kinda version at the church camp country
poker cheat month

163
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:19,479
reporter tailored we Sergio preprocessor

164
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,350
every script in the in your source tree

165
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,760
compile right up front get everything in
the database all went

166
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,810
we're finishing additional announcer for
at that time because we're not

167
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,660
constrained by

168
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:35,160
oh my god somebody's requesting a page
right now you don't want to

169
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:40,240
go-slow compare your script you really
believe that we can be

170
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,010
we can look deeply into which will be
scurred

171
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,040
likely do we know we see pics

172
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,319
particular types going it's terrible
that trickery

173
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,780
this gives us another 10 percent gain
over no a particular

174
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:59,459
her so that's where we are at

175
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:04,180
Facebook today for our servers actually

176
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,280
just their utilization dropped
immediately when we going to cut over

177
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,110
tainted reimbursement

178
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:14,260
where we have to be in PHP and pull
Astrix there because we can't measure it

179
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,600
exactly more

180
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,670
there are a bunch of features in hip-hop
that are not in

181
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:22,500
regular PHP so it's hard to text
everything

182
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,180
apples to apples but what we can test
sure that we're still alive after

183
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,650
term you actually are about to remove

184
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,780
the HP's PC pieces from the source code

185
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:40,010
out of hip-hop entirely because it can
get messy unanimous really like you

186
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:41,819
anymore

187
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,930
if you are using the rain are you will
still be able to access it on me

188
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:49,989
which he the branch and hit get her back

189
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:53,950
I wouldn't use it which games much
better

190
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,980
her reaction you think I we actually
bringing up

191
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,990
all right now the only distro that's
like supported as sort of a first class

192
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,630
destroyers blue-chip

193
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:06,250
I we actually are building a package for
this right now that we're hosting

194
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,490
external to the repository and I'd like
to commend someone to pick it up but

195
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,710
there's a few things we need to do in
terms there

196
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:16,500
I'm making our Pakistani feel a little
bit cleaner

197
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,560
before they'll actually pick it up

198
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,180
you can again if you're installing for
going to you just had one when she

199
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,120
reaches yep sources list

200
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,260
apt-get update a console hip-hop PHP

201
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,680
darn Arabia otherwise

202
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,359
beer is a dreamy fire in the first tree

203
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,170
few wiki I'm explorations how to get
things compiled

204
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:44,959
if Ameritech I live event actually has
to be patched before

205
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,600
built because we've got a few extra
things for HTTPS URI

206
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,380
on you need the most recent version of
curl

207
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:57,150
728 got X whatever term

208
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,600
when officers and their on libraries
like TVB

209
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,700
until three building blocks library we
need

210
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,870
a really recent version that most
distros only embers into

211
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,050
we need version 4 so there's

212
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:13,199
there's gonna be a bit more work to do
to actually get this thing installed

213
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,130
distributions that's the reason we're
officially supporting ability because

214
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:22,090
the British company's recent packages
for releasing

215
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:27,460
good for you gotta built and you've got
it installed let you bring up a server

216
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,520
this is the one running configuration
for you this'll get your server running

217
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,680
right after that I miss a config file
this is a good thing for work on HD

218
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,120
after the whole explanation

219
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,730
that format in the docs directory armed
bandits

220
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,450
pretty straightforward kinder

221
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:47,010
G finish a girly

222
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:50,880
this basic configuration is going to

223
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,140
you kinda bad a it's going to put your
pad fire in a bad spot temperature by

224
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,569
could cash in hand by

225
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:00,240
you don't wanna do something as simple
on this is more of a typical

226
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,900
development configuration here

227
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,500
hopefully this year I'll be pretty
straight forward on the staff

228
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:13,310
her

229
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:16,859
production is going to be not much
different from development you just can

230
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,600
add a few extra configuration directives
here you wanna make sure that

231
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,630
you're not lying on the warning you're
going to use switching to report or

232
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,400
Tatum nerd

233
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,459
where you're not going to interpret how
is your current

234
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:32,800
on in mir's a few things I want to point
out in the lower left hand corner

235
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,880
against

236
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,050
flight here that last three Marys

237
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:40,339
the actual started but the server he
could lead to a patchy future

238
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,530
start on the line

239
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:47,560
up above it is for building the initial
report that

240
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,160
that big database from all your scripts
on from the search could

241
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,230
I've got back extent fiction there
because

242
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,840
as about two weeks ago that was when you
to run

243
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,480
we hire separate binary for HP HP nerd

244
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,410
we've actually just switched it for
everything is in a single hehe in binary

245
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:09,569
any happy HP's PC switch

246
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:13,350
Serotec changed a bit recently

247
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,550
just F

248
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:20,060
so why can't the corner

249
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,439
this is a breaking point right here this
light on

250
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,470
there's a lot of things with the puck is
not supported mister we don't support it

251
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,630
mean spaces other somebody's working on
right now I

252
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:34,280
hoping you will commit by March April
sometime

253
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,949
on we'd go which have a good extension

254
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:43,550
story really if you want to write your
own hip-hop extension you can have to go

255
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,219
through some hoops

256
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,720
from new york i'm not as well and be
after going to commit in Exmouth

257
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,160
pretend and there's a whole bunch
extensions I got

258
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,490
at the big ones listed about the
standard ones

259
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:00,260
listed on the bottom here we're not
currently supported them as soon as we

260
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,069
get our extension story fixed up

261
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:06,740
recreate should be privileged pickle I
repository for

262
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:11,670
I'll be extensions that aren't
necessarily partner will install

263
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,069
going to put those in there and you'll
be able to install them hopefully with a

264
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,270
single command

265
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:20,329
not when I

266
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:23,800
also were you know it may just not be
worth it for you term

267
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,599
you know again Facebook's got a few
times houses observers

268
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,270
it's worth it for us to get back in our
case

269
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:35,260
6x performance increase connects when
fixtures many servers

270
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,720
that we actually need and not translate
into a lot

271
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,710
operational expenditures 190 that or
something like that

272
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:48,230
and after peak

273
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,800
may be running your server often one
machine are you getting a house in here

274
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,430
today

275
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:57,219
hip-hop for you if it worked

276
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,330
you're gonna have to Train Your ops
people how to deal with

277
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,460
starting to deploy missile I big out
lame but

278
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:08,339
something things to consider

279
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:12,198
term I want about well performance like
I said

280
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:15,270
you know pictures shoulders like the big

281
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,289
thing that I'm just going to keep
harping on over and over again if you're

282
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:21,119
bringing your code three times is
officially

283
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,770
13-01-30 me sir

284
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:28,189
the further you go the more that makes a
difference even with 128 RBIs

285
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:33,260
if you have tracked fewer if you're in
Fishers that's going to be a luxury

286
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,330
something to consider are

287
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:41,409
now I are focus for an extension
development under your page piece I'm

288
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:44,880
bro book %uh maybe so when I look at the

289
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,230
extension development story between the
two even though it's a bit

290
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:52,340
harder to get started on the hip-hop
side because

291
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:56,100
actual interest is not there yet I do
think righty extensions for hip-hop is

292
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,030
much much much

293
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:00,450
easier and I got example the more
prepare the top corner

294
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:03,500
is a simple hello world tech function

295
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:09,190
in regular PHP you gotta go through this
process reporting of the stack

296
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:12,800
and you have to do some explicit memory
allocation pink

297
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,940
again people in functioning popular on

298
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:20,560
it had picked up your function prototype
is actually what it looks like in PHP

299
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,780
word

300
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,730
my front my function here takes four
parameters I've got this corporate

301
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:25,910
mergers armory

302
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:30,640
decoration its arista me a lot more
intuitive

303
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,100
I'm there is a difference in purse that
we're in C plus plus went

304
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,870
on hip-hop for sissy learn PHP

305
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:42,070
people think c plus plus can be a little
bit scary because I'm all the magic that

306
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,159
it does

307
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,620
but it does have a nice advantage
cleaning up after

308
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,989
help really well

309
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,030
take the good with the bad there I R
we've also got

310
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:57,280
a lotta language features that you're
not referring to trigger PHP

311
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,720
I should put it next to the first when
generators there because PHP is actually

312
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,350
now adopting generators

313
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,919
I'm nice guy

314
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,780
mickey about because he wasn't hoping I
could be wrong

315
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,120
armed if I P speedy generators but the
whole implementation

316
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,350
committed to list and few weeks later

317
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:20,639
we've got it and implementation that is

318
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,640
a superset really as hip-hop version and
peach version has

319
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,680
few extra features that we're now going
to take for PHP

320
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:33,830
for everybody's equal are generic to the
Big Bang

321
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:37,470
I don't know how many you are using PHP
and wish you had your

322
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:40,110
their Jeffrey something that a lot of
people but still offers like Java

323
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:43,620
developers like I'm

324
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,179
maybe not sure what their I we've also
got some

325
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:52,080
short action there for strict typing and
specialized collections

326
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,530
there's certain like a race but special
and I'll

327
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:59,730
show you a few examples of I miss you
fix it P earlier

328
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,780
diffuse are shemale like

329
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:06,950
syntax said embedded within PHP
arguments I got

330
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:11,180
these tags here there's no quotes it's
just here's a tag here's content here

331
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:14,550
that's because be ex rel tag are now

332
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:18,950
their own first-class entity within p
hip

333
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:22,290
now why does that matter is used if I
can count including

334
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:25,340
things the internet doesn't matter know
these are actually

335
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:29,020
classes and objects that know how to
deal with the country there been getting

336
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:33,240
and most importantly the mill what
beaker texted back content is

337
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,760
and you can see that me output here in
the case have de llegar

338
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,500
we declare that you can xHB tags: get a
paragraph

339
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,050
welcome from you dare in paragraph

340
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:49,879
in this when i text each P if this were
just you know from pure kind of a string

341
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,700
literal

342
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,110
this would be a dangerous thing because
music and provide any candidate anyone

343
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,500
throw in there

344
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,600
because effect rich P it knows it this

345
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,949
variable substitution you're putting in
fact that paragraph

346
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:05,870
it supposed to just be content it's not
supposed to be. HTML tags it's not

347
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,110
supposed to be

348
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:10,889
anything that the browser is actually
going to interpret sold out but tickets

349
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:14,470
gonna do any still special cars were

350
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:17,910
and we can see for example that in
dollar evil we put it inside to the

351
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:18,870
strip and they

352
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:22,010
string literal it would get is ampersand

353
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:27,300
Lt me calling script what so that
exercise never get the chance to get we

354
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:31,159
this is not something that UI designer
should have to think about

355
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,440
UI designer should just be putting in
lamb

356
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,850
and this allows the UI designer ok

357
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:40,860
near if you really do want really alexis
has

358
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,199
you can do that with this HD not
function

359
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:51,200
I don't recommend it but whenever
whatever works for you

360
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,930
sex HP is extensible we can create our
own networks not just a dirty shemale

361
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,110
stop

362
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:02,139
in this case I suggested a apostle are
you I'm a new elements

363
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:06,720
you i mean you had a moment ago in it
this me then get translated out to you

364
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,180
garrison expanding list elements
whatever

365
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,809
RBC the Paley cm lecture

366
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:17,440
shows extending xHB only if you re

367
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,570
they have the special meeting space
separators call

368
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:23,720
are these get translated by

369
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,510
the uses on the right hand side

370
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:31,200
anytime you use a tag within PHP scope
that turns into

371
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,500
Colin tagname as a class in Houston
chief ecommerce

372
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,140
after the weather actually could has as

373
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:43,330
attributes and a thing within the tag as
its children

374
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:47,520
so my you I'm in your takes a national
title containers tightly corruption

375
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,530
where

376
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:52,059
track tentacles each country's corner

377
00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:58,450
earned it it takes children are any
number I love you I menu items

378
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:03,380
to improve that's pretty straightforward
just looking at that

379
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,490
I'm hack is another extension three
minutes

380
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:09,920
because its own on this computer but
what act is

381
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,900
is an extension to language to include
strict I P

382
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:18,640
everywhere we can tell abortion
promoters with the taking including

383
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,350
permitted

384
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:23,780
we describe what the return type
functionaries and what

385
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:27,309
biscuits used by is tripled first

386
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:31,200
we had a integration with our own editor
that we britain

387
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,590
we're going to the first that is openly
combat editor is going to look at both

388
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:39,020
information in it's going to make sure
that you think functions correctly

389
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,900
heat actually there's one before you
ever actually run the code do not factor

390
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,290
of course we're back

391
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,760
second is during runtime it's going to
enforce

392
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,500
type checks all over the place it's good
for the right kind affairs when things

393
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,040
happen

394
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,030
and you're going to feed a much quicker
sure if you can actually when you're

395
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,210
comparing to

396
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:00,580
you report her to admit it's going to
track Trefis

397
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,939
all the possible information ever worked
as an assistant says

398
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:08,380
warning disk might come out wrong in
certain situations or

399
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:12,290
air this is always going to come

400
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:15,460
I V anything we show in here are our
collections

401
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:19,820
earn in this case for children vector
image: this is basically like having an

402
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,389
array

403
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,790
but you enforce that if I was going to
be numerically indexed

404
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:27,800
connector its always going to contain
into tears because got are you typed

405
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,970
and if the singer generic syntax here

406
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,860
we've got maps and facts and I'm

407
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:40,199
a pension variations others in there as
well

408
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,929
Commission BR specialized I do you we
have this is a web-based

409
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:47,860
I E that on you run a large on the
server on your

410
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:51,699
development machine and your

411
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,960
that export the web server getting
editor it can be

412
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,910
share between the two people on the
scene file it integrates with get

413
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:04,100
to rate you can see irritations and
histrionic good morning

414
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:08,330
integrates with hack so it knows but
takes expected as auto-completion for

415
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:10,428
all the suffering in

416
00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:14,240
or stalker testing out right now but the
developers we have in our testing are

417
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,540
just

418
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:20,280
loving how I did it so we definitely an
open-source soon

419
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,850
and yeah

420
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:28,000
Napster should be ended their lecture
person s I'm hoping you have much

421
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,860
questions

422
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,949
I've liked pretty printer

423
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:36,260
go preach question well

424
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,679
I'll talk about to be resource is then I
V Sri be breached

425
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,290
the repository fell if I can get help on

426
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:47,389
now will favor the way we're dealing
with a pull request

427
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:51,820
is kinda I'm we basically had nobody
working on the open source

428
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:55,309
adversity hip-hop up until about last
summer

429
00:25:55,309 --> 00:25:58,790
when I took it over in a min you're
trying to clean things up

430
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:03,389
I'm but we still had a process where all
the market apt happen internally first

431
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:06,590
really pushed not to get I'm I know
that's broken I know that's not going to

432
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,790
last

433
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,879
we're gonna make them better I promise
I'm

434
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,850
so when you look at right now you're
gonna see a few pending polly klass

435
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:18,830
I'm does not pulled in either because

436
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:21,990
they were submitted two years ago and
got ignored because your buddies are

437
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:22,380
here

438
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:27,290
source or even partially integrated and
they still keep each other even pulled

439
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:34,290
in

440
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,990
I'm our goal I'll

441
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:39,229
you can have audio look at that wearing
a video for Mac appear

442
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:43,390
I'm our goal for the next year is to
train hit a 150 percent

443
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:47,020
up white HP HP with HP PC which keep

444
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:54,020
her will we'll see if we meet

445
00:39:58,930 --> 00:39:59,950
typing like

446
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:03,970
at first blush term great year get a
speech PC

447
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:08,129
project was started just did hack I went
back and

448
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:12,730
you knowi like C plus plus free ensure
that Saurabh became the nuclear family

449
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:19,170
and actually think I'm actually starting
to like the perfect because the cap

450
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:22,410
are you here I might template there's
magic

451
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:26,080
operator overloading there's magic I
have no idea what's going on this code

452
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,259
because there's no magic

453
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,570
it pops kinda converting

454
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:37,570
free Inc

455
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:45,060
so you might notice I was a wee bit have
our site that

456
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:48,750
might have noticed some Wendys earlier
flight I had to blackout factions

457
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:52,670
yeah on there are some things that
weren't

458
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:56,970
I'm not allowed to talk about yet I'm I
consider cool

459
00:40:56,970 --> 00:41:01,520
but that means your pink I'm got my 50
check

460
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,800
yesterday like in fact it I'm oh and
they were a

461
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,630
solar I want to serve their side should
mention

462
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:12,750
terms for me sad Astrix Bynum

463
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:16,650
arm OCI in particular we actually have
energy extension internally

464
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:20,920
black it requires some some weird stuff
with I'm

465
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,180
none public domain

466
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:28,629
DLL are exotic I'm so we can tax relief
it directly

467
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:31,800
I'm working on finding a way that we can
make an optional build

468
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:38,800
in case you happen to have that soap hey
closer

469
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:42,420
I'm so impassioned start

470
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:45,920
just because the hash extension support
everything and cash does

471
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,960
so honest review the entrance right now
I should probably switch over to the

472
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,360
hash extension which both rigor PHP and

473
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:56,040
up support fully I'm is kinda no reason
to stick with it

474
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,990
requires an extra library that's GPL

475
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:04,879
in am an issue with ppl no sorry for
cheap health

476
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:10,300
LGPL arise when your link it

477
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,510
cash is a perfectly square
internationally

478
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:16,850
%um

479
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:21,900
nothin reactor

480
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,960
it see arc

481
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,800
morphing picture now be scared of the
dark

482
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:35,170
actually of economic doctor because the
cameras backer

483
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:38,210
cuba power

484
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:41,560
it is too early morning agree on that
oMG alright

485
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:47,840
there now sweet argument that research
to fight back at

486
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,730
term I encourage you to

487
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:55,050
like the page on Facebook if you wanna
get announcement about what's going on

488
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:58,360
on a plane to poster fairly large

489
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:02,090
sorted roadmap a hip-hop for next year

490
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:05,570
will tell you exactly what we're trying
to do I we expect certain features to

491
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:06,290
come online

492
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:10,230
we are going to start version we're
gonna do some branching

493
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:13,650
early to say okay this is version 2.0
point

494
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:17,660
acts any to stable with me to play
online we're not going to uni features

495
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:20,620
are limited but by pictures he can't
guarantee of stability

496
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:26,150
your production servers and rest
mckarrick

497
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:33,150
hurts it really her man

498
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:39,720
well the FBI DEA

499
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:43,149
your when is that going to be weak
released I we are still in development

500
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:44,350
cycle on it

501
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:48,740
so we're not quite to a dumpling yet I'm
we don't even have your winter you fear

502
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:51,850
it hard to completely

503
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:54,850
East scientific wow they guessed I'm

504
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:58,210
I would probably say that we're going to
get to

505
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:02,290
feature completeness then we're

506
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:05,710
here you cook summer

507
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:10,100
that's completely off-the-cuff guess

508
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:14,160
million T through

509
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,480
