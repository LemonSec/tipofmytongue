8 sorry and the

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,700
well most of tank with a calm because
most of them are based on the use

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,829
so that sucks so

12
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:42,090

26
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,970
red

27
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:09,449

29
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,880
we make make but jokes but

30
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,069
if that's a its use but jokes so

31
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:24,619
what this haven't we well we are not an
asset

32
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,120
an attempt to make a him to use s is
sweet

33
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,209
again if they're prolly knows how about
that as much as we

34
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:35,510
a again to lose usually able to raise
will have to think I'll let you splash

35
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,179
which means

36
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,459
you can ensues what's your packets with
people with me

37
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:43,049
and their a Sat

38
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:46,230
us at we understand perfectly that
justice may want to use

39
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,450
with that being said the few that and
they must be able to the soul

40
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,899
and we like them being able to do so

41
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,989
who put everybody so

42
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:59,850
not lot of basic auditing

43
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:04,180
well it is a2 but not anymore and they
now we had

44
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,340
doing create quite a extensive cook
leave you spying when we are working on

45
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:08,709
it

46
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:12,310
in order to prevent things that channel
flax and stuff like that

47
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,549
and a you sonya comic has to be a review
it

48
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:19,680
by at least one all that you that the
middle but and a

49
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,560
if it's not quite important to me is
necessary at least 2 reviews

50
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,980
before it's accepted so in that aspect
we I think our best

51
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,950
make well good coat at least is not
contest the cold

52
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,388
we try our best it tickled with you
before we

53
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:40,970
a.m. policy I because we note that the
ball

54
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,109
include ep can be a serious problem
because

55
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:47,150
I mean are you said cannot boot the
system for example

56
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:52,260
that could be something really bad it's
not the into only thing

57
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,310
if there is any other at least it wasn't
a lot but I don't hear that wants to

58
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:55,970
join us

59
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:00,359
he can do so you want to use this on
your list was in a sauna tonight if to

60
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,459
their you cancel

61
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:05,260
and if you honey backs that are related
to you that

62
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,340
on anything not into placed in them will
try to fix them

63
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,260
Philly and there yet it's not a close
play at the need

64
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,269
a if anybody wants the UN is welcome to
do so

65
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:23,269
so this is just the

66
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,179
you the people that have committed to
maintaining

67
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,610
you does and just making it work

68
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,729
on we have Luca at their

69
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:45,330
0 I tried to get

70
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,099
Anthony best deal Louis to come here

71
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:54,349
that he's teaching right now
unfortunately he's been doing

72
00:04:54,349 --> 00:04:58,130
a lot of the work on the build system
you we factored

73
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,190
make file support that

74
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:05,590
we have for Francisco chronic

75
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,900
already on excess I don't believe

76
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,719
think he made it as well on Matthew

77
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:16,620
now hi on Tony Forlan

78
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,740
he unfortunately cannot make it either
and

79
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,000
Richard is actually with Anthony as his
student

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,719
so in

81
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:33,719
the way these things work without you

82
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,270
what is not which is the general
direction

83
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,460
meaning okay we do this call we

84
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,710
to read the part put it back together
what we are going to do with that

85
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,719
his well

86
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:52,900
the usual stuff more or less we want
something that is

87
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,909
simple p.m. and possibly whether it's so

88
00:05:56,909 --> 00:06:02,839
you can read your eyes lead we try to
stick to the Sounders

89
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:06,279
meaning that we try to get rid of
everything that is

90
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:10,310
not exactly see GDP expansion on or

91
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:15,289
something that is quite ACP's specific
bad you can do without

92
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:18,599
so you that can be a with like seal and

93
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:21,849
on YouTube its UTC or something like
this:

94
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:24,909
some people is that we provide that

95
00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:29,450
well most of the people involved are
sort of interesting

96
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:33,029
this kind of provide alternative so

97
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:36,110
unalterably Lipsy should Lord

98
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:41,520
with our project

99
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,479
yes or even muscle more or less

100
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:49,479
than a the other direction we try to

101
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:53,310
keep everything a separate this possible
so

102
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,820
if you want to make some match you can
so

103
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,089
we tried will provide yes

104
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:04,500
a support for all kernels Sabah for

105
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,849
alway to breakthroughs when it's
possible we do

106
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:12,550
so if you have something that is a
legacy system

107
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,969
you cannot well update the kernel or

108
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:19,570
is a quite and also to update all the
rules them

109
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:23,990
we provide to you way to survive pretty
much death

110
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:28,849
generic idea

111
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:32,659
well so short term

112
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:36,190
it said nothing the there are loss of

113
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:40,039
gypsies Pacific called we try to removed
them

114
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:43,580
replace it sometimes CZ sometimes is

115
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,580
while or for we are trying

116
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,789
comp compare not sick okay

117
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:54,560
we still need c99 compiler that means
that

118
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,029
about you have not that many
opportunities

119
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:06,029
the mainline are supported yes

120
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,709
okay a can architecture agnostic means
that

121
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:17,010
the okay we got new goodies

122
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:21,779
with the new kernel up we know people
that are struck with

123
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:24,979
then the branch that are not updated so

124
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:28,709
try to support them for system

125
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:32,179
nothing okay we got lots of people that
have

126
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:35,588
large deployment you some kinda

127
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:39,950
range weird the out we try to support
them

128
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:45,279
a is not just using you that with
magically solve all your problems

129
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,130
if something is not broken before

130
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,810
our session one warned you all

131
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:56,310
to stop issued

132
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:02,550
we tried to yes

133
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:09,550
so the question was what are we doing
different in that regard

134
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,630
I do remember which session a

135
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,920
more or less track some user like a a
ton there because

136
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,449
a they've force you to

137
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,080
do something actually you won't be able
to complete the boat

138
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,160
because you need some specific feature

139
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:34,790
yes

140
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:39,209
up

141
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:43,800
I mean you US that I did slush you there
was something you want support but we

142
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,109
supported

143
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:50,209
know what that's about you're saying
because upstream you have to support

144
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:51,880
such as fine

145
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:58,860
and it has forever and I think change
their

146
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,740
a single branch

147
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:08,120
I yes okay when I'm going to tell you
what we have a

148
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,850
to the with about was anther what will
happen to them

149
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:18,490
the first thing we I'll with it was a

150
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:22,170
making a pakrats that would work well
gentle that was not your fault

151
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,219
that question to spark a two-fold now
you there

152
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,680
works well in with about you sir and
that's because say

153
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,819
the things we have learnt was the you
the app

154
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:36,250
hustle be useful what they do that
developers

155
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:40,100
but in the future we take to improve a
little bit on that aspect

156
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,500
I mean we want to for example a

157
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,970
be able to mark whose as mean particle
at mount points

158
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,970
listen to the government to wait until
the amount so we can wait

159
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:54,160
and the there before wept like that
tools

160
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,360
at the Fairmont points that are you
there

161
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,980
the

162
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:09,980
up

163
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,980
awk

164
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:21,980
up

165
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:51,250
up okay YouTube it was him so you once

166
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:57,310
want to run you to and slash user is not
mounted

167
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:01,170
and the air and then you have for you to

168
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:04,199
rules which one to startle to Lynn's

169
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,700
this user but it is not yet mounted what
do you do

170
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,020
well 102 tPSA

171
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,390
the week that also we can apply it onset
by the use at this moment

172
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:19,660
is keep a key of the rules we cannot
apply yet

173
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:23,949
because the that he say staff that they
need that is not there

174
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:28,360
and then apply them a

175
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,070
we X we will execute them are at on on
state but you said his mom

176
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:36,360
yes %uh attorney you can

177
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:43,360
X a yes 02 other well

178
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:47,320
attorney will be in or their

179
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,430
with already aerostat meet but you said

180
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:54,239
but not with but not with their toast
need bad on

181
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:01,240
so

182
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,550
we also have wanted up and he meet at
the at most the queue depth that goes

183
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,910
back to the use that stuff

184
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:11,069
I see you wanna meet and imitate the

185
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:18,070
to mount you about you said it separated
stuff like that yeah hopefully it's not

186
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,920
not only through i mean their problem
there Benin

187
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,060
on it at the it's not that you that the
style you that problem

188
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,099
but if there is no unit that the and

189
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,839
there is an estate sale like at separate
but you said and we need to play our

190
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:36,270
best in order to fix it

191
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:43,180
yeah it's about getting easier maybe

192
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:49,170
but s put up

193
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,650
the majority of these are but issue with
the gem

194
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:56,480
dove packard was not with the source
code

195
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,630
this project no working so

196
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,689
you're gonna pics Midori abuse in your

197
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:08,610
you build up

198
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:15,610
have a chocolate up

199
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:24,030
so honestly the

200
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,959
separate user issue really just confuses
the point it just

201
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:32,699
its a minor right it's a minor separate
thing there are many reasons why we did

202
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,060
this

203
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,400
other than pool superuser reasoning

204
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:41,240
so

205
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,600
was the rate yeah so

206
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,360
them was a major reason for the forking
it sent it's another slights

207
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:56,360
attorney prolly the best threesome with
her for the Fort

208
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:01,420
it's learning no no no I said

209
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:08,400
leading not let up I I

210
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,030
I think this is like a bizarre with that

211
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:16,560
though air we have paid to it's a 11
model detail that

212
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,069
and with AP particular I mean

213
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:24,709
we have lent Lord just by forget the
staff doing

214
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:28,369
Casey comets and monitor staff that was
so that happy most because was a moving

215
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,709
piece suco it's not working because of
that

216
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:37,709
so the the clear the issue that I have
with you if it's

217
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:46,390
really not that you guys for UK everyone
have a scanner

218
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:49,420
they do point out the things as system
he would support

219
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,630
about system is a likes it seems like
you that supports a pretty useless to

220
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,230
relief I'm

221
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:58,089
it supports Rd non-stick stuff just fine
and all this kind of stuff

222
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:02,490
like it's it's like at flight doesn't
make much sense

223
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:06,120
it's like an hour its for I'd

224
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,199
about upstream well

225
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,310
play a complete their at non all their
apps objectives

226
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:20,310
I'm getting or

227
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:28,400
those

228
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:40,589
short time is for us probably they are
shipped about

229
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:43,720
is working okay so those are

230
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:49,550
our short term objectives is not why we
did the fork

231
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,699
the so that that's more or less

232
00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:56,500
okay we are trying our best to get to
this point

233
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,100
if it's a problem of packaging is the
problem of adding that the fork onto

234
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,250
your

235
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:05,290
biting you are not depending on what you
want

236
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,438
farther later a well those are our

237
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:11,829
objective if your question is what the
hell you did

238
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:14,829
for that is far more or less that

239
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:17,879
okay we can yes we do yes

240
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,419
we want to learn that we will to figure
out exactly what the hell is about

241
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:26,720
you that that is so strange or so let's
Eric still

242
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,790
just three people here knows that good

243
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:33,560
we try and that's it the problems that

244
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:38,260
too many people got this kind of strange
expectation

245
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,330
that we will defeat the EB overlord

246
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:45,500
right here no we are just learning

247
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,810
and this is ass a pet project that

248
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:52,980
some people the side that lost huge
important and whatever

249
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,990
is just our pet project we are doing

250
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:59,600
our best to do to achieve some
objectives

251
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,020
we are trying to actually well the first
point is learning

252
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,600
so we do learn we will probably

253
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,090
break some system if somebody is so
foolish to use it

254
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:15,580
min

255
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:20,399
is somebody decide to use whatever
software that is not exactly

256
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,590
ready for the prime time from that
primetime just looking for it

257
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,790
so up we had not say

258
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:31,909
from start and hate for core we have
some kind of

259
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:36,380
interesting idea about conquering the
world it is not yet

260
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,780
a we aren't just a

261
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:45,120
experimenting stuff the easy for you
that could be experimental

262
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,050
a am we are trying our best we are
trying to

263
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:53,260
be as coordinator in the as

264
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:58,780
well regular about what we are doing we
try to use the bedspread x2

265
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,050
not me a mess i Justi

266
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:05,850
the code itself is complex so

267
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:10,330
we happen to cure it all just because we
want something simple to see

268
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,860
and then maybe put back it together once
we

269
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:18,870
understand exactly what the cause is
doing not doing

270
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:23,750
pretty much it is so those are our short
term 'cause

271
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,919
maybe some is does a matter of packaging

272
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:32,230
some others well a bit more encompassing
says

273
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:35,370
supporting its Texas them or not

274
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,850
under System is usually fun

275
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:42,689
you see learn about it and said so

276
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:47,020
our short everything as simple as
possible

277
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:50,550
quite stupid we know

278
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:54,050
and a somebody wants to use it

279
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:57,080
maybe there is to break or maybe they
are fine with it because

280
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,889
say simpler

281
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:04,770
said try it contributed

282
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:09,629
with us said

283
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:14,500
light

284
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,480
okay death probably the other question
about

285
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,080
okay so ago and

286
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,210
slide on so

287
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:29,550
one in the things that people we found

288
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:32,908
worried about when we 40 you to to you'd
have

289
00:20:32,909 --> 00:20:36,060
was a that we would

290
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,470
diverge from you dad and make
incompatible changes

291
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:42,470
and make it so that

292
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:46,390
all the stuff that supports you don't we
would split

293
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:49,630
that we would and just making
incompatible

294
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,690
its but I'll we are aiming to keep

295
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,800
API compatibility with you'd have as
much as possible that

296
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,850
as much as long as it does not interfere
with sum up our

297
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:03,668
longer-term goals in

298
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:08,570
its simple

299
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:12,939
so the when we initially 4q dove

300
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,120
we did it could be factor

301
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,139
because the combine kobe's to insist
Indian you do

302
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:23,140
was something that we did not

303
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,890
we don't we do not like it being
combined as it was

304
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:30,270
on we wanted it to be simpler smaller
more agile

305
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:33,379
on

306
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,450
funny up is

307
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:41,630
so we've me made the build system than
we found that the

308
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:45,149
bill system for system to you to was

309
00:21:45,149 --> 00:21:48,610
not area

310
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:54,320
will all isn't is something silly that
was fast it was

311
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,270
I believe wanted the initial complaints
was that be

312
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:05,270
had to build system D in order to build
you def

313
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,100
ap decide if the shirt causes system the

314
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,899
laws sugar-coat but since the namespaces
Cindy

315
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:17,489
well able to call it system the so yes
units

316
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:21,169
to be a system the at least part of it
at least login stuff

317
00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:24,260
these whatever that is in the shared

318
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:31,260
directory

319
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,190
we are placed so the question was the

320
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:38,390
do we build the stuff in the shower
directory assistance you'd

321
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:41,880
I Wiese I believe what happened is we

322
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,020
dis respected code and its

323
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:49,770
not shared directory more since just
you'd me restrict

324
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:53,810
no no no no we don't rename the trick
well we have a slight on that

325
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:59,000
and yes min

326
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:06,000
River buildings the same hope

327
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,929
you you turned the the thing on make
filing top directory into a recursive

328
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:21,440
bill system which basically means

329
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,550
everything directory now used to be
built

330
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:27,310
and then one step and then you build the
next one rather than everything in

331
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:31,379
parallel

332
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:35,870
this was just

333
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:42,870
up

334
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:43,669
pack

335
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:50,090
in and another public so

336
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:53,759
this is just the perhaps so

337
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:56,929
I'm trying to get through all the slides
and hopefully most at the slides will

338
00:23:56,929 --> 00:24:01,039
answer some of the questions well

339
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,899
believe you have money questions but the
food system the police will test will

340
00:24:04,899 --> 00:24:05,299
miss

341
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:09,039
because he is the one that did most of
the work at that aspect

342
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,750
so made a common this image that is you
speak louanne s

343
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:16,110
on fernald and he will be able to us but
then it was as if up

344
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:19,459
prolly that and I'll of us together okay

345
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:23,029
so

346
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:26,870
for the reason that we 42 others to
support legacy systems

347
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:31,918
on an we can do that with just beer
configure flag is

348
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,220
its just more mixed up on

349
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:41,820
legacy I'll the old-style

350
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:48,220
the you liberals help

351
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:53,620
so one of the things that we're working
on is

352
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,479
to monitor after and

353
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,059
and monitor mounts so that

354
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:04,210
when rules depend on stuff that are
within those mounts

355
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:10,090
we me trigger and I guess we
nationalized

356
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:15,918
you know rules are whatever or whatever

357
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,950
I am so

358
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:24,240
and

359
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:30,390
system up

360
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:36,840
but we don't

361
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,250
124 system to you to be on

362
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:44,780
package you want to support things like
a winner CE

363
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,910
upstart other think other in its systems
on

364
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:54,910
so we so we pulled

365
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:58,389
Ruth pulling a couple if teachers outta

366
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:04,140
system D that are useful they're good
that

367
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:11,140
a hunter on it

368
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:26,779
I'll

369
00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:30,970
asylum it some time at all his blog we
have someone to call us on me

370
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:34,139
at the cuff been spread I don't you that

371
00:26:34,139 --> 00:26:37,539
a eat like to note that

372
00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:40,539
Wednesday you there a started

373
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:43,649
we even got any requests for an
interview

374
00:26:43,649 --> 00:26:47,570
from the media Akali we only got one
party that had not thanked was what it

375
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:49,490
left them because we were madly sort

376
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:53,509
that line will stay in the courts in so

377
00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:56,970
a dennis Howlett the pooled

378
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:00,059
and meets that have been a split old
both able to their

379
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:05,789
about you that and that at least for the
website with like to play at

380
00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:10,090
021 symbolic you there and they would
have done with like a fairly long it

381
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:12,678
takes the stand and face the clerk at
once a bombing killed it

382
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:15,809
that we might have a spat yeah really do
it

383
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:19,889
that you think and so and

384
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:26,309
and one month when men and women i sat
on their sites that we are

385
00:27:26,309 --> 00:27:29,809
database for work I think quite obvious

386
00:27:29,809 --> 00:27:34,759
may note that not thats is we have
nothing

387
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:38,369
a article that I system the on it with
it

388
00:27:38,369 --> 00:27:41,928
we have thinking but the colonized
leonard gays

389
00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:46,480
their network and the

390
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:53,480
1

391
00:27:56,070 --> 00:28:03,070
because this is working well up

392
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,490
whether

393
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,159
up

394
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,490
method yeah call so

395
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:21,740
at they we need quickly it used to
collect some necessities that we had

396
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,480
back then

397
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,090
they were not related to with AP self
some of them were related to call with

398
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:27,740
packets at the

399
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,789
but the for example a

400
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:34,230
we want a to her to be let that what you
said

401
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:39,010
be able to used the last this feat using
the ip was using whole cat memes

402
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:44,760
okay alt that the pain all for some for
something like two point six pointed to

403
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,250
two with just at the

404
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:49,640
if they want acknowledge that the one
but the

405
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,950
the two you fight about but at least the
last night they met getting that

406
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:56,690
would have been a while you know what
this so

407
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:00,270
would like people to be able to use most
of the universe to

408
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:04,360
he felt better if they can a well

409
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,549
thats likely ally

410
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:11,370
it shouldn't be a state like that i with
you that the sensible so

411
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:14,549
at the interest layouts a police say

412
00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:18,200
our alt way of political that the
principles that they system layouts

413
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,380
and their yeah

414
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:25,799
half let the their issues as with their
let the blame if the penny on that one

415
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:28,990
the we want them to be able to you

416
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:32,649
to use the best patient

417
00:29:32,649 --> 00:29:35,709
at that day you there remove on people
rules

418
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:38,860
yeah because mostly they're left just
after with it

419
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:43,250
I mean things like for some but they all
naming or network interface s

420
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:46,640
and list similar stuff that we

421
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,299
like at least two I don't for some time
it may not work but

422
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:55,090
we have a plane how I were there and the

423
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:58,970
then there is the fact that they their
peace matter consistently

424
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:03,059
and the was there is no longer super on
a stand-alone you there

425
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:06,149
the we red

426
00:30:06,149 --> 00:30:10,600
that comment on that saying back then
muscle if he if he you will stand by you

427
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,639
now saying in the future everything

428
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,210
be system the and no think there's and
the

429
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:21,309
with that won't be a separate play it
that that was one of the reasons why

430
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:22,350
with that the full

431
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:25,780
therefore but then and their

432
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:29,049
well will have a lot of useless that
happy with openness

433
00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:32,100
the so we'd like them to be able to keep
you see

434
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:39,100
then I mean if they using open as the
then there is the copyright yes well

435
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:45,140
a i think is that and place will miss
them it was me it was my fault

436
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:49,010
a the SI staff was basically a

437
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:52,340
really big news from the stir
misunderstand the allows

438
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,600
and stuff like that I say say

439
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,219
we were talking to their I plan it
though on bury some copyright

440
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:04,030
either I so the that the benetton pee
and poo

441
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:08,039
when they see him because into the lot
better world calls their

442
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:11,149
and there when I had ponied up there two
or three

443
00:31:11,149 --> 00:31:14,260
over really have any frequency and
eights while another

444
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:18,419
detect a copyright here which by the way
you could respond that I

445
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:23,330
who help lot a because there were
different for months the format

446
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:23,980
depending on

447
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,059
it's fine and the so

448
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:30,570
well a finale what they call me really
be call me

449
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:34,700
a was a pic to my personal brand and
with a one-sided affair

450
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:38,190
I want to sleep there was people
monitoring how r

451
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:41,700
any the we were going to

452
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,049
break lows that what people not
returning my branch

453
00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:50,158
which only hope that got me and the yes
and I thought

454
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,409
we never method that met at that the
bathroom

455
00:31:53,409 --> 00:31:57,710
and their networking to maintain them
animated what also the fat than

456
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:02,149
we've got I lot many I'm on me and I
love affair complaint

457
00:32:02,149 --> 00:32:06,629
up so place I accept my apology from
that aspect

458
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:10,360
well i think is if you think some belief
that s on their

459
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,168
I'm sorry that a

460
00:32:14,169 --> 00:32:18,399
then

461
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:22,418
will have to take all the while yes you
know you they're pissed at that

462
00:32:22,419 --> 00:32:27,600
Sally quillian and a everybody knows
that the best way to NOLA Computerworld

463
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,029
the

464
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:32,720
and the moment this is something you see
it won't work anymore so

465
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,090
the we play it to a similar thing that
that moving pieces of you have the

466
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:37,879
company that mean

467

00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:45,418
we at something that last us close to
the corner

469
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:49,250
their past week will we play at that
level that because as we could

470
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,909
you know that law holding what and one

471
00:32:52,909 --> 00:32:56,260
the a funny we want to put by

472
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,549
evident that there would be more with
most of the staff that will remove it

473
00:32:59,549 --> 00:33:02,639
and slowly on sweetheart love how it
works

474
00:33:02,639 --> 00:33:06,689
please take into account that you that
be separate without the law

475
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:09,820
history I breaking the law the fee to
use

476
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,980
and the we have me mean

477
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:17,600
it's hard for hasta la everything on a
single so we want to go

478
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:24,600
step-by-step another complaint is that
the level ever

479
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,610
in spfld yell we've taken that I mean

480
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:32,729
that's not me. we have an experience
that when it comes to that

481
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:36,080
we have my little to you that before
yeah

482
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,720
when who but any a few things we

483
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,090
probably would have to apply it we
already have some experience developing

484
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,699
further

485
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,780
and a we r it on what we call me would
like to

486
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:53,480
present-day you pick the stuff like the
one week one week

487
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,919
and really I mean we developer

488
00:33:56,919 --> 00:34:01,350
added

489
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:05,090
on me I'm 10 p.m.

490
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:08,639
me our way not the best one always

491
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:15,639
on 11 but good

492
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:20,668
little you'll

493
00:34:20,668 --> 00:34:27,668
who would

494
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:32,929
I worst-case everything got gets
meditate back into

495
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:37,389
reenact at the bank or if nothing gets
mad at their workplaces

496
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:41,010
there and nothing has happened analytic
s or vice versa

497
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:45,129
the other player takes over l1 get a
place to met with their

498
00:34:45,129 --> 00:34:48,830
be you know one and we're a happy and we
pay to be

499
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:52,810
together that's not a problem and what
that will at that time he felt that I

500
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:53,500
really hate

501
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,929
a they state that you there is yet to no

502
00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:00,330
I mean hormone first at the scene we
still

503
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:05,330
a keep commenting using with a hip is
that the view that begin to

504
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:08,990
in order to make happy Saints like
removing with their permanent the wee

505
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:09,339
wee

506
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:13,970
we could meet the super the course in
and that's not going to happen

507
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:17,060
a do that we need is to get to the same
as the

508
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:20,140
you that was the intent same as the ps2
Cup

509
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:23,848
use used to refresh button yeah we had a
lot but so what

510
00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:27,660
I mean that's like the alexei that
everything that I face

511
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:31,149
its aight by C span the no he set up
itself

512
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:35,030
personal opinions that may not be the
same deploy it

513
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:38,240
unfair in general well

514
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,598
yet we are into you to project which
means that we used at the festival

515
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:47,580
we are into the pillow pet but we are
not be in

516
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:52,920
so I yeah well I really like that one
yet that definitive solution who are you

517
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,119
said

518
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,859
about it but the same yeah no we had

519
00:35:56,859 --> 00:36:00,650
I mean and that I think that maybe if
they be broken

520
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:03,709
any after happen battened

521
00:36:03,709 --> 00:36:07,999
what we are going to play is to make it
little problematic for the USACE

522
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:12,129
as we come from our it may work well my
what a bath with the

523
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:16,299
by your face I ASA yeah I think it's not
at all

524
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:20,109
well in some cases

525
00:36:20,109 --> 00:36:24,519
we are going to play our method I'm not

526
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:28,939
we think it and saying we are going to
play you make

527
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,130
a no

528
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:35,170
I'm not blow me think that we are going
to fix it please note it down

529
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:38,829
I don't put we don't premies all we are
going to fix I'll

530
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:43,079
the case is about you said whatever most
of them I companies is that we are going

531
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:43,630
to try

532
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:48,410
and with the hopefully we the worst case
well we get a wall

533
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:52,660
with about what I but

534
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:57,288
all so I think

535
00:36:57,289 --> 00:37:00,339
column 12

536
00:37:00,339 --> 00:37:07,339
it is

537
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:12,509
are yes well I don't quite have
questions but I A would have

538
00:37:12,509 --> 00:37:16,180
something to it this project the UDA

539
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:20,669
was made the I believe so

540
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:23,690
that was made for

541
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:26,930
every this rule to not

542
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:30,399
listen to Leno it's cold am i right no

543
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,019
okay listen I mean by listen

544
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:38,238
into a use it so

545
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:41,630
the everybody thinks Leonard scored

546
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:47,769
is awful everybody thinks that that
don't know laureates

547
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:51,609
just it's just that seeing a

548
00:37:51,609 --> 00:37:54,759
some or at least

549
00:37:54,759 --> 00:37:57,869
as the at least some of them well the
thing is

550
00:37:57,869 --> 00:38:01,589
the thing is a there are

551
00:38:01,589 --> 00:38:05,109
many anything as you want to see a local
call

552
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:09,589
both my workday cafe both from where but
because of the value

553
00:38:09,589 --> 00:38:12,589
any wifi oval opened

554
00:38:12,589 --> 00:38:16,349
okok okay perfect a.m. the ideas

555
00:38:16,349 --> 00:38:19,890
there are some developers out there

556
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:23,058
in all other distros that are still
interest into

557
00:38:23,059 --> 00:38:27,339
all standards the Hooda and I'm sure
love it

558
00:38:27,339 --> 00:38:30,430
some other than Kyle are usually coming
gandu the

559
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:33,749
to ask well I need to all our

560
00:38:33,749 --> 00:38:37,419
a a you are package from March

561
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,440
for for you that day I need that that

562
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,499
backagain RPM package well the question

563
00:38:43,499 --> 00:38:46,629
is why not having an alternative

564
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:49,880
to system the thats

565
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,420
my question we happily

566
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:57,670
it with of course I mean you are gay
there is a lot of things that are not

567
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:02,709
the end but that Afghan is them worded
okay

568
00:39:02,709 --> 00:39:06,229
it and they have not done anything to me
modest up but there were you sleeping

569
00:39:06,229 --> 00:39:06,939
pad

570
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:11,809
the with them yeah

571
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:15,319
the idea the idea is to have a valid

572
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:19,369
you have you their system I mean to have
a working

573
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:22,369
you their system and to be to be almost

574
00:39:22,369 --> 00:39:25,660
I to be honest

575
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:30,118
as are as i've seen the EU the was was
not quite

576
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:33,180
well integrated in %um am i right

577
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:36,959
well I mean the 3

578
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:40,140

okay used up okay it works %uh who is
doing the

584
00:40:01,549 --> 00:40:05,309
all the main kal the project with a
moment

585
00:40:05,309 --> 00:40:08,409
first up is the slashers are

586
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:12,249
I stuff is just a small little feature

587
00:40:12,249 --> 00:40:16,859
that requires the more packaging
coordination than

588
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:19,859
just a tension some need to call

589
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:23,589
here and there an a say

590
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:27,959
is not just saying OK from

591
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:32,269
tomorrow we will support it because
haven't a number of issue

592
00:40:32,269 --> 00:40:35,308
and the number of issue the non issue is

593
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:39,159
you're having that you have a server
that is completely set a

594
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:42,699
okay you can even do without you that
from stops

595
00:40:42,699 --> 00:40:46,219
ok some people need some be at the few
that for

596
00:40:46,219 --> 00:40:50,719
whatever reason than you have to make
sure that that be it

597
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:53,759
doesn't require lectures are and

598
00:40:53,759 --> 00:40:57,489
it is a simple as that how to do that
you have another

599
00:40:57,489 --> 00:41:00,669
a of late but is not X sock-b_

600
00:41:00,669 --> 00:41:04,439
depending on justice bit is something
that is more ok

601
00:41:04,439 --> 00:41:08,178
all local passing it over yet Anderson

602
00:41:08,179 --> 00:41:11,829
lot of people are still testing us about
it so

603
00:41:11,829 --> 00:41:15,469
okay we will have a look about it
because there are people that are

604
00:41:15,469 --> 00:41:16,130
interested

605
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:19,339
you know open source 11h

606
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:23,669
discretion so we got people that are
quite focus on that because that

607
00:41:23,669 --> 00:41:27,908
larger valued at the use whichever
strange architecture

608
00:41:27,909 --> 00:41:33,140
sold they will try to contribute to this
project you want to contribute to this

609
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,999
project Europe we are quite happy to
have you tried

610
00:41:35,999 --> 00:41:39,058
are you interested in cooperation with
other distros

611
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:42,150
obviously yes the want to be is that

612
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:45,779
this project is a gym to project meaning
that just into that stuff

613
00:41:45,779 --> 00:41:50,749
no is a gym to project just because so
it's really it's mainly

614
00:41:50,749 --> 00:41:54,178
for other dearest this shows to also
cooperate on

615
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:58,909
you there if they're interest in make
the if they're interested in making the

616
00:41:58,909 --> 00:42:02,529
alternative with if using alternative

617
00:42:02,529 --> 00:42:05,539
EU death right yes hopefully we'll have
books

618
00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:10,079
involving actually looks that we aren't
able to solve and the for example when I

619
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,429
see that there is a person with you went
to the settlement there

620
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:16,499
if you also want to have you there and
you have problems welcome to open box

621
00:42:16,499 --> 00:42:20,288
we are going to play our best I'm fixin
and if you want to join the project you

622
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:23,679
can ask that wanna kiss question

623
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:27,349
a one last word if you are trying to
call

624
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:31,119
to seek cooperation other distros how
will you re presented

625
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:36,539
I believe that's how

626
00:42:36,539 --> 00:42:40,829
d report bugs aka so

627
00:42:40,829 --> 00:42:44,419
we so the origin to project the

628
00:42:44,419 --> 00:42:47,848
source code and most about tracking is
taking place

629
00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:54,609
and get home just about going to have
you don't what

630
00:42:54,609 --> 00:42:58,959
out so initially when we first for the
project

631
00:42:58,959 --> 00:43:02,859
levy try to focus on just getting the
code base

632
00:43:02,859 --> 00:43:06,819
same and working still

633
00:43:06,819 --> 00:43:11,099
we focus mainly on Jan two sons were
mostly gentle developers

634
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:16,900
we are as we grow and as we get
everything more stable we

635
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:20,599
hope to work with other distributions to

636
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:26,199
have you dove working with them as well
okay

637
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:31,109
new Christian I'm he said you're hoping
for people to contribute to your project

638
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:34,269
and like you expect that to be or become

639
00:43:34,269 --> 00:43:37,758
a community project and you want to
learn because based am

640
00:43:37,759 --> 00:43:41,469
and you consider working the right way
to you

641
00:43:41,469 --> 00:43:45,169
to work within existing community
project I actually thought about

642
00:43:45,169 --> 00:43:49,189
by well one thing is a question them
which is thought about approaching this

643
00:43:49,189 --> 00:43:49,839
by just

644
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:53,969
cloning the existing you do making a
Bronx

645
00:43:53,969 --> 00:43:57,679
has your features on it IQ regular
distribution brahms

646
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:01,779
and then trying to submit those back to
the yeltsin project to space and emerge

647
00:44:01,779 --> 00:44:02,400
requests

648
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,919
and that by also you working together
with with the existing you have

649
00:44:05,919 --> 00:44:06,598
maintainers

650
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:10,630
and you you actually learn from their
experience before you have to make a

651
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:11,989
lotta carcasses ever learn

652
00:44:11,989 --> 00:44:15,150
the slowing height weight so up again

653
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:19,039
respond to this initially at least a so

654
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:22,209
for the reason that we factored the code
is to

655
00:44:22,209 --> 00:44:25,979
in just make it simpler

656
00:44:25,979 --> 00:44:29,038
I know how to explain a freelance I am

657
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:35,630
that in

658
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:39,699
0 yes there are a few patches a

659
00:44:39,699 --> 00:44:44,069
for instance a won the reasons that we
Fort is because

660
00:44:44,069 --> 00:44:49,719
someday except for stuff was not
accepted upstream

661
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:55,159
as so up

662
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:58,939
force have well except for stuff my

663
00:44:58,939 --> 00:45:03,499
maybe it's to just fix the Lipsy in
question rather than walking around in

664
00:45:03,499 --> 00:45:07,569
and you said 20 I mean it's just a
question

665
00:45:07,569 --> 00:45:12,389
a ship

666
00:45:12,389 --> 00:45:16,009
other one probe probe project whether

667
00:45:16,009 --> 00:45:19,339
bug actually is usually what

668
00:45:19,339 --> 00:45:24,269
what you mean it such as I mean keep

669
00:45:24,269 --> 00:45:27,578
architectures and in the kitchen where
where basically

670
00:45:27,579 --> 00:45:32,329
the in sync with the current board

671
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:36,150
them so well their other in its open
source

672
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:39,389
convicted everywhere sure now earlier
about

673
00:45:39,389 --> 00:45:44,219
yet for if you will a have the problem
of integrating the whole thing

674
00:45:44,219 --> 00:45:47,799
sometimes you have people that are stock
with something that is not

675
00:45:47,799 --> 00:45:51,079
that optimal saw you have to be a

676
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:55,559
well really sick and yes obviously you
would live to fix the problem

677
00:45:55,559 --> 00:45:59,199
where it is but workarounds are what
make

678
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:04,900
stuff working up

679
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:09,189
well the final

680
00:46:09,189 --> 00:46:12,538
group like them

681
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:17,039
at real-world so

682
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:21,109
is the same as that water did you some
branches forming every decision I there

683
00:46:21,109 --> 00:46:22,219
has patches to

684
00:46:22,219 --> 00:46:25,289
upstream packages and you know that's

685
00:46:25,289 --> 00:46:29,679
very common way of working weird
distribution different Cesar

686
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:33,499
handled in the circumstances if there is
a problem with

687
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:37,209
with packet right on your budget you
know in your lips Ian

688
00:46:37,209 --> 00:46:41,209
in the right place in this region or
whatever or if you need a workaround

689
00:46:41,209 --> 00:46:45,578
you need to put into to you for users
need just because there's

690
00:46:45,579 --> 00:46:50,130
on a crazy situation attorney

691
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:53,259
we would we like to think of you there
as a pet

692
00:46:53,259 --> 00:46:57,579
that's an awful them I mean that was
compared to change the code buyers

693
00:46:57,579 --> 00:47:01,119
ethical debates and now it's almost
impossible to talk to stop

694
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,239
you there to their a much better

695
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:08,650
about their weeee work thinking of it as

696
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:13,749
our own personal for their with the Pats
wanted to see their

697
00:47:13,749 --> 00:47:16,839
so it's not that the fan know what to
say a funny

698
00:47:16,839 --> 00:47:20,029
well came to visit the way because by

699
00:47:20,029 --> 00:47:23,529
by approaching the project in that way
your your you're almost

700
00:47:23,529 --> 00:47:27,630
consciously and deliberately creating
some kind division

701
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:31,709
rather than working home decisions
always worked for many years which is

702
00:47:31,709 --> 00:47:34,959
to carry these these parties please
upstream the ones that can carry the

703
00:47:34,959 --> 00:47:35,948
ones that they can

704
00:47:35,949 --> 00:47:39,949
in their attention packages am by serb
announcing it

705
00:47:39,949 --> 00:47:44,229
is public project in taking that route
rather than going down

706
00:47:44,229 --> 00:47:47,968
the more traditional its is almost
growing division by

707
00:47:47,969 --> 00:47:51,380
by its very nature well actually

708
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:54,659
we don't think that working debates
these him

709
00:47:54,659 --> 00:47:58,880
I mean and booking will only pay to be
seen if there is no communication

710
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,549
between two sites

711
00:48:00,549 --> 00:48:03,639
to that have forget that are you now
playing

712
00:48:03,639 --> 00:48:06,919
we are happily train koala bears put the
most that the reason

713
00:48:06,919 --> 00:48:09,939
from our project and we're playing our
best world

714
00:48:09,939 --> 00:48:14,029
to communicate with between us and the
people on you there

715
00:48:14,029 --> 00:48:17,079
at their data it one of the reasons why
I personally

716
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:21,529
sent an invite to special yet to come
because we want to so that we don't hate

717
00:48:21,529 --> 00:48:21,789
them

718
00:48:21,789 --> 00:48:26,259
but we want to communicate with him did
he just say that

719
00:48:26,259 --> 00:48:30,189
through the re factoring that it it's
almost impossible to

720
00:48:30,189 --> 00:48:34,158
twosome port something from one project
with the other

721
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:39,650
and idk the ugly KS only happens with
words but also with code

722
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:44,359
and if you may need treatment is like
making it

723
00:48:44,359 --> 00:48:47,969
incompatible I mean I don't see them
much latest

724
00:48:47,969 --> 00:48:52,920
the biggest changes that it has gotten
more is incompatible with the

725
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,929
initial upstream one thing is that our
project it's a

726
00:48:56,929 --> 00:49:01,009
not directly on but the compatible with
lip as in this sense of fairness that

727
00:49:01,009 --> 00:49:02,209
will happen made

728
00:49:02,209 --> 00:49:05,299
most battering you cannot support about
to collect

729
00:49:05,299 --> 00:49:08,309
was at the bill that another different
areas that they

730
00:49:08,309 --> 00:49:11,789
yes we r play of this is that swept away
and abuse at the you there

731
00:49:11,789 --> 00:49:15,009
because the bases is because same

732
00:49:15,009 --> 00:49:18,759
a broadly is fighting in some parts and
you think a slightly different ones

733
00:49:18,759 --> 00:49:21,759
you can get it done at some lip

734
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:25,569
yeah but I think you should be very
careful about

735
00:49:25,569 --> 00:49:28,808
if you think of the future your project
should

736
00:49:28,809 --> 00:49:32,359
try to not an edge more division

737
00:49:32,359 --> 00:49:35,969
for very little reason let's put it this
way

738
00:49:35,969 --> 00:49:39,469
well polyurethane I wanna booooo our
best not think based

739
00:49:39,469 --> 00:49:43,659
that debate we are dedicated and think
that their

740
00:49:43,659 --> 00:49:48,709
despite our project being home at the
Munsell something like that

741
00:49:48,709 --> 00:49:52,538
three months old the it's not that that
some sort of

742
00:49:52,539 --> 00:49:57,170
revelation thing out there anyway but no
sanitary the politic knows that there

743
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:57,880
were no sense

744
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:01,170
Sat are probably the best thing in the
world

745
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:05,319
it the worst thing in the world because
basically a that evolution use

746
00:50:05,319 --> 00:50:08,808
they too getting he said fast badly

747
00:50:08,809 --> 00:50:12,170
and but stuff that you saw them Pats and
in bed

748
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:16,670
you end up with things that are hot to
maintain or cut that the whole thing

749
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:20,339
or think that about but the I what aim

750
00:50:20,339 --> 00:50:24,979
is that at least when we get to a stable
grant and without

751
00:50:24,979 --> 00:50:28,529
as little changed from you that as
possible history from

752
00:50:28,529 --> 00:50:31,979
with ep as possible okay

753
00:50:31,979 --> 00:50:35,448
hi my name's Michael I'm looking for
them project

754
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:40,509
for some alteration I mean name you to
probably wasn't the best choice of

755
00:50:40,509 --> 00:50:45,069
for your pro two I'm opposite I'm if
you're talking about your project or the

756
00:50:45,069 --> 00:50:45,359
odd

757
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:50,769
original project just an observation I'm

758
00:50:50,769 --> 00:50:53,808
so that's fine one is system the

759
00:50:53,809 --> 00:50:58,650
the other issue that year but to just
sayin I mean it wasn't

760
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:02,249
it was exactly clear when you were
talking about what so

761
00:51:02,249 --> 00:51:06,308
specific get the topic about seles user
or separates less user

762
00:51:06,309 --> 00:51:10,439
I mean I'm coming from baby and there's
also assaults of talk about

763
00:51:10,439 --> 00:51:13,969
how we have to support that and I know
the difficulties that bring so that

764
00:51:13,969 --> 00:51:15,739
entails and

765
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:19,009
I mean you also talk about kiss and I
think

766
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:22,109
if you if you look about the idea to
just use the unit

767
00:51:22,109 --> 00:51:25,839
Rd 22 mounts this user and you get you
solve all the

768
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:29,159
those problems for free but this just so
compelling

769
00:51:29,159 --> 00:51:32,159
or in i mean the the easiest way
obviously is to not

770
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:36,369
use a separate such user but if you you
just take those two sets

771
00:51:36,369 --> 00:51:39,979
and see which uses are there which don't
want to eat happen

772
00:51:39,979 --> 00:51:44,279
Rd or which don't want to have us less
user I mean there aren't that many

773
00:51:44,279 --> 00:51:48,069
and having to complicate things that
much for such some

774
00:51:48,069 --> 00:51:52,459
II dunno I mean maybe you you have a
magic idea how you solve this

775
00:51:52,459 --> 00:51:56,638
your YouTube rules I mean how excited
you want to do that

776
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:01,199
do you take the binary look if that
since less user intended for the rules

777
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:01,939
or

778
00:52:01,939 --> 00:52:05,928
mean height how do you know if a binary
which even isn't slash been

779
00:52:05,929 --> 00:52:10,319
a.m. butts needs resources from other
parts of the system is less user

780
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:13,400
how is this supposed to work I can't
imagine how

781
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,659
so the Atlanta a couple of questions
there I

782
00:52:17,659 --> 00:52:21,469
won the

783
00:52:21,469 --> 00:52:25,679
I think the batteries back um 12 the

784
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:29,709
one of the reasons that weeee for is

785
00:52:29,709 --> 00:52:33,049
to support so

786
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:35,579
at a hundred percent this is another we
want to support as many of them as

787
00:52:35,579 --> 00:52:36,429
possible

788
00:52:36,429 --> 00:52:40,859
I am just france is pulling a number out
of a hat

789
00:52:40,859 --> 00:52:44,199
Cindy you'd have supports ninety-five
percent just

790
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:47,349
a number um we aim to support
ninety-eight percent

791
00:52:47,349 --> 00:52:50,719
re just trying to get those few users
for trying to support them as best as we

792
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:51,569
can

793
00:52:51,569 --> 00:52:55,109
on some users are not able to use

794
00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:58,380
and it Ortiz

795
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:01,729
at mall howard's embedded systems a lot
of the time

796
00:53:01,729 --> 00:53:05,459
from do you really think embedded
systems have complicated layout with

797
00:53:05,459 --> 00:53:09,399
separates less user for example yeah I
don't think so for such as what I'm

798
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,130
talking about

799
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:13,429
that the set of user no for example will
have a lot of a

800
00:53:13,429 --> 00:53:18,619
you says that absorbs with really costly
not separated but both but the Sims

801
00:53:18,619 --> 00:53:21,919
those people who caught up in the hype
bank getting money that the that will

802
00:53:21,919 --> 00:53:23,558
take like 10 20 megabytes

803
00:53:23,559 --> 00:53:26,839
that they cannot using it sees them

804
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:33,839
I mean haven't there in bolivia example
that this is the using a bit into

805
00:53:38,109 --> 00:53:45,109
up so what

806
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:50,799
okay

807
00:53:50,799 --> 00:53:56,949
got some

808
00:53:56,949 --> 00:54:00,539
up a is not a matter

809
00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:04,709
of God you're wasting time or

810
00:54:04,709 --> 00:54:08,399
whatever is just somebody that as this
problem

811
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,169
once a solution

812
00:54:12,169 --> 00:54:16,419
I don't know if his if the guy wants to
work on that

813
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:19,848
so be it

814
00:54:19,849 --> 00:54:23,579
the the res 1 I think of it this way

815
00:54:23,579 --> 00:54:26,919
so many people has the problem it's 81

816
00:54:26,919 --> 00:54:30,449
and you pose the next person but a makes

817
00:54:30,449 --> 00:54:34,130
a lot of trouble for that one use that
you think that when you said is going to

818
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:36,419
say good things I will too

819
00:54:36,419 --> 00:54:41,439
you said you know you said you are
having problems with food

820
00:54:41,439 --> 00:54:45,979
you said you're having problems with
hard whether you think they happen

821
00:54:45,979 --> 00:54:49,069
I mean and if you do it by putting
something you are

822
00:54:49,069 --> 00:54:52,380
doing you said about user experience

823
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:56,809
he is not only going to you not they not
to not to use you pull your

824
00:54:56,809 --> 00:54:59,859
his ass along too sate the worst thing
stonewalled

825
00:54:59,859 --> 00:55:03,169
on your project and if somebody say
something but to him in any

826
00:55:03,169 --> 00:55:07,319
it's not true he's going to be a big hug
before using that

827
00:55:07,319 --> 00:55:10,939
so if at their forty takes to make that
you said

828
00:55:10,939 --> 00:55:14,368
not on the it's not that much this to it

829
00:55:14,369 --> 00:55:17,479
why not less let's make an

830
00:55:17,479 --> 00:55:20,939
another item ally karnal

831
00:55:20,939 --> 00:55:24,899
2.6 point 30 to

832
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:28,179
yes there are many system that are using
data and our stock

833
00:55:28,179 --> 00:55:31,869
with that should we support them or not

834
00:55:31,869 --> 00:55:38,869
down stories yes

835
00:55:38,919 --> 00:55:43,359
by if we can play not

836
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:50,359
up

837
00:56:04,189 --> 00:56:09,439
so want one simple question a.m. one is
for the system developers and the other

838
00:56:09,439 --> 00:56:10,618
one is for the UDA

839
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:14,089
you there developers so the question is
same

840
00:56:14,089 --> 00:56:17,959
and why did you decide to drop support
for older kernels

841
00:56:17,959 --> 00:56:21,229
and why did you decide to put the

842
00:56:21,229 --> 00:56:25,158
super for the current us back in the

843
00:56:25,159 --> 00:56:28,769
wants to go first

844
00:56:28,769 --> 00:56:32,538
so we decide have a tough one

845
00:56:32,539 --> 00:56:36,909
we decided to split

846
00:56:36,909 --> 00:56:40,729
we decided to support the older kernels
because I friend that needs support for

847
00:56:40,729 --> 00:56:41,709
the older girls

848
00:56:41,709 --> 00:56:44,788
thats for the reason

849
00:56:44,789 --> 00:56:48,109
they will have to use as we saw them be
say it that and only used

850
00:56:48,109 --> 00:56:52,469
2.6 points 52

851
00:56:52,469 --> 00:56:55,549
which

852
00:56:55,549 --> 00:56:58,819
arm when you're up root system you
upgrade everything

853
00:56:58,819 --> 00:57:02,139
you cannot always keep backward
compatibility for everything

854
00:57:02,139 --> 00:57:05,699
arm someone who changes occur in all the
time

855
00:57:05,699 --> 00:57:10,819
we break or use both ways digital no
because your crew other packages

856
00:57:10,819 --> 00:57:14,329
you can through you just your
maintainability

857
00:57:14,329 --> 00:57:21,329
things over time is good to drop things
and put away

858
00:57:29,719 --> 00:57:33,449
they wanted to well

859
00:57:33,449 --> 00:57:36,670
Terry that is one example that is
somewhere you could want to

860
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:40,639
a great you that I left school a few
years but

861
00:57:40,639 --> 00:57:45,670
that West is nice based on this an issue
we can do that

862
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:49,650
that there could be exploited the other
to get through access by some states

863
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:53,389
steamy stuff I'm not sure if it was you
that we're def

864
00:57:53,389 --> 00:57:58,079
or different but it was one of those two
packets just at the scene

865
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:01,170
and the

866
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:06,039
and the then just for fun okay I know
can I would see you cannot to create

867
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:06,900
because they

868
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:10,769
have to stop at King Soopers whatever
and there you have that personal view

869
00:58:10,769 --> 00:58:12,339
that

870
00:58:12,339 --> 00:58:18,420
would you like to be able to

871
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:22,269
okay so

872
00:58:22,269 --> 00:58:27,459
we have to live so we will discuss
probably side

873
00:58:27,459 --> 00:58:30,538
up the shower nation for that okay

874
00:58:30,539 --> 00:58:34,089
people was some software that uses new
the view that

875
00:58:34,089 --> 00:58:38,119
the trick lies in you you'd have and
they are stocked with that colonel and

876
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:40,029
the system is like

877
00:58:40,029 --> 00:58:43,499
set the box multimedia staffing you
really want the new version of the

878
00:58:43,499 --> 00:58:45,319
software so what you do

879
00:58:45,319 --> 00:58:48,459
you try to be put up and thinks

880
00:58:48,459 --> 00:58:52,190
all the user submited so everything is

881
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:56,039
sort of okay and thank you do again for
the other

882
00:58:56,039 --> 00:58:59,449
stop or you Ripple Down and if you
thought

883
00:58:59,449 --> 00:59:03,179
done if you can touch the kerner you try
to toss

884
00:59:03,179 --> 00:59:06,789
the stuff that is the closest into chain

885
00:59:06,789 --> 00:59:11,119
you actually would like to upgrade
soccer analyst and

886
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:15,219
you that maybe not because by simple

887
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:19,799
to say one last thing it's underneath
form with

888
00:59:19,799 --> 00:59:26,719
and CyanogenMod 11 it's the florida
point 2.1 percent

889
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:31,170
and it uses 2.6 points 59 kennel

890
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:34,759
because their developers of DNA on don't
want to

891
00:59:34,759 --> 00:59:39,269
dated I'm

892
00:59:39,269 --> 00:59:44,258
no it doesn't pass UTEP in there but the
point in trying to say is that they re

893
00:59:44,259 --> 00:59:49,089
that uses that this the needle that can
this because limited it a month after is

894
00:59:49,089 --> 00:59:50,449
a stupid enough not to lose

895
00:59:50,449 --> 00:59:54,630
up

896
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:58,089
with %uh the one thing like there is a
quite why we don't support that

897
00:59:58,089 --> 01:00:01,558
it's like it's not that we only support
the most recent we support like a couple

898
01:00:01,559 --> 01:00:03,579
of that like back

899
01:00:03,579 --> 01:00:07,579
wanna years or so but I'm the thing is

900
01:00:07,579 --> 01:00:12,589
truck simple clean code that that is
reliable and we always wanna pick

901
01:00:12,589 --> 01:00:19,589
the the problems where they are so in
order to keep symbols

902
01:00:21,949 --> 01:00:25,579
know who you know you have to keep
always the convertibility forever they

903
01:00:25,579 --> 01:00:26,599
like it that makes it

904
01:00:26,599 --> 01:00:30,529
Cody me to deal with if there's a need
to be was always bugs missing is also

905
01:00:30,529 --> 01:00:33,759
it's about the big question about the
test matrics basically

906
01:00:33,759 --> 01:00:37,449
like if you wanna support all the
possible combinations of law for any

907
01:00:37,449 --> 01:00:38,309
worse never

908
01:00:38,309 --> 01:00:41,670
the new explode your test metrics and
you actually need to to to make sure

909
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:43,349
that all works together

910
01:00:43,349 --> 01:00:46,989
at the same week on reddit do I don't
know it it it's a question of keeping

911
01:00:46,989 --> 01:00:48,219
code simple not like

912
01:00:48,219 --> 01:00:53,199
liked am we tend to not want to have
that many if steps for example in our

913
01:00:53,199 --> 01:00:54,019
stuff

914
01:00:54,019 --> 01:00:57,169
and we're pretty good at that and Ben
for example for the except for stuff

915
01:00:57,170 --> 01:00:58,049
that they were raising

916
01:00:58,049 --> 01:01:02,099
-ism yeah we don't we think that the
acts up for stuff is something you much

917
01:01:02,099 --> 01:01:02,880
better fixin

918
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,029
Lipsy once and it works for every am

919
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:09,880
tool then I'm vixen every to like work
around in every tool in halves if

920
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,670
doesn't have to configure checks and
have the

921
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:15,319
the implementation except for its system
the way to work and now you can say of

922
01:01:15,319 --> 01:01:15,829
course

923
01:01:15,829 --> 01:01:19,749
yeah and i know it it's it's basically
we like our coats simple and

924
01:01:19,749 --> 01:01:20,698
maintainable

925
01:01:20,699 --> 01:01:24,769
and clean and then you can read it and
that there's no if Steph there's no side

926
01:01:24,769 --> 01:01:26,149
effect that you can see

927
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:29,249
there's no non your stuff that we
contest

928
01:01:29,249 --> 01:01:34,098
I want to be sure that when I compile
system deep that that actually

929
01:01:34,099 --> 01:01:37,139
I'll test I'm that is in the system the
tree

930
01:01:37,139 --> 01:01:40,839
but I can't do that if they're the if
deaths and tons of

931
01:01:40,839 --> 01:01:44,288
optional coat that is this is used in
some systems but not on mine

932
01:01:44,289 --> 01:01:47,989
so it's it's a question about about them
and in a way with this to me we are

933
01:01:47,989 --> 01:01:49,829
relatively fast in developing things

934
01:01:49,829 --> 01:01:53,509
and the way we do this is by making sure
that that weekend test

935
01:01:53,509 --> 01:01:56,849
the stuff as we go and and be reliable
in that

936
01:01:56,849 --> 01:01:59,699
if you have all these obstruction code
like it that the same questions about

937
01:01:59,699 --> 01:02:01,439
portability to other operating systems

938
01:02:01,439 --> 01:02:04,888
if you have all the obstruction code in
there and you always need to make sure

939
01:02:04,889 --> 01:02:07,749
that also works on the other parading
system everything so it's a question

940
01:02:07,749 --> 01:02:08,459
about

941
01:02:08,459 --> 01:02:08,709
yeah
