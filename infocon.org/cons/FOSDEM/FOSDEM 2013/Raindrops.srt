1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:04,190
so many slides have been recycled from
talks in some of you may have heard

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,190
on the dock last year except

3
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,940
the project has been evolving so hope
even go through the whole thing with you

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:11,799
to see it now

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,820
a lot of maybe's an order coming soon
have actually been replaced by

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,500
functionality that accepts right now

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,740
so distant as a show of hands how many
people here use

8
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,880
the cloud art a louder Caracas most
people excellent I'm

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,538
so you need only to go into the basics
to um

10
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,340
during drops in the face is something
that ok a little bit about me

11
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,700
I'm a sysadmin based outer London I do
send us stuff

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,910
a I like bullet points

13
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:47,360
and I like the rain and Belgian beers
yes but here's a good

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,920
all that live in the UK now for but both
years I still prefer Belgian beers

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,699
I'm probably going to get assassinated
on the way back or something

16
00:00:54,699 --> 00:00:57,890
saying that I'm so sad thing is the

17
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,699
just it looking at the problem
definition will be there trying to solve

18
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:02,489
I'm centers is everywhere

19
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:05,979
in terms the cloud rate it's a lot of
people are tough people are selling

20
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:07,270
services in the cloud December

21
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,759
lot of people are consuming the cloud in
various ways use you sent us

22
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,450
I a lot of vendors love hosting
companies retail

23
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:19,880
from and South End us images instances
but the center's distribution itself has

24
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,280
been for traditional use cases it

25
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,450
wasn't built with a cloud in mind I mean
the way the installer works

26
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,700
is meant to be for automated billing
their convention tradition kind of

27
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,650
infrastructure in a moment with
management tools work is

28
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:35,340
again it's going to be for tradition
enterprise users are traditional kind of

29
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:35,880
setups

30
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,689
and then that kinda cause a bit of a
problem um

31
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,939
because even a delivery for

32
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:46,929
what we actually push out is we deliver
ice was an HTTP indivisible condone

33
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:51,320
which are not usable directly but what
they deliver to you as a user

34
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,339
is finite is fixed when you install
CentOS the kindly get

35
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,640
is predetermined you know exactly what
can you going to get the ocean a bashing

36
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,469
together in a PHP or http or back to
whatever you're going to get is peterman

37
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:05,189
but then again in the be shipped to it
and the cat is in the bush deliver with

38
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:05,548
is

39
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:09,720
doom for addition architectures as it
were I'm

40
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,190
and addition BW eyes or whatever um

41
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,569
bahut different are

42
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:20,349
at the Cowgate not really very different
in that you still have to do

43
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:23,629
a provision to have to build an image
you still need to have something that

44
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:24,230
you can run

45
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,760
right you still need to manage that
instant easterly to patch manage

46
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,018
with in that instance for security
issues for bug fixes so from that

47
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:33,370
perspective the not very different from
traditional use cases

48
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:39,250
um but the different enough to merit
specific consideration and to us the

49
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,239
biggest deal was

50
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,590
that we need to be able to talk to them
about delivery mechanisms and how they

51
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,730
consume what we ship

52
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,340
and how they deliver to use as what they
further on ship to condemn

53
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:55,370
I'm to the issue was that we found a lot
of people coming back to us until he

54
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:00,000
I bought VBS from hosting company a and
they gave me this this this and it that

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,580
I wanted to move to Austin company be

56
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,290
and I bought Center 6gb/s and I had
something really different what is down

57
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:05,640
about

58
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,659
and I wanted to move to a WS and that
was a completely different thing

59
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:11,950
and I wanted set up a developer VM on my
laptop and that look like

60
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,760
it was completely different and
basically what is happening was that

61
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,720
every when they're

62
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,150
takes what we push out and salt to taste
and

63
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,790
when I mean based that usually depends
on what distribution

64
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:27,260
what best practices work issues what
history what has been the life term

65
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,599
experience of the guy who's actually
creating the images

66
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:34,750
in many times it doesn't affect company
policy and made and it doesn't reflect

67
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,349
what they'd actually expecting to shift
it reflects what the guy building image

68
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:39,659
talk was what is uses on

69
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:43,179
right and that in a situation to be in
am

70
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,180
so we started talking to enter the
second people who would come back

71
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,290
and and complain to us and we found that
there were issues like people

72
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,819
worshipping 5.3

73
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:54,060
in 2011 be worshipping 6.0

74
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,360
in 2012 and the like be no but those
images have security issues do you know

75
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,500
that he should not be doing this kind of
thing and a lot of them were you know we

76
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,689
put in the effort even to the pain of
setting up a VM it took us like three

77
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:05,760
weeks to get it going

78
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,140
I don't have the resources to do it
again and that was pretty much uniform

79
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,970
from our listing companies from ABC

80
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,799
places across-the-board without looking
like this is a problem that we can solve

81
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,870
so we spoke to some other users

82
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,918
that the vendors give us access to the
vendor say

83
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:23,810
I've got a hundred years as his tan you
can talk to and see what the actual

84
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:24,930
problems and we did that

85
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,889
we spoke to people who consume liquid
web services we spoke to people who

86
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:32,110
most repair1 we spoke with big ABS uses

87
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,330
we spoke some people the new learning
broke out as well to see what

88
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:39,389
will be could actually do I'm and the
problems like you were talking but

89
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:40,500
delayed access

90
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,660
people warned arm he's been doesn't have
resources to make that happen

91
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,380
which basically there was a massive gap
between what the windows are doing in

92
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,719
with the use really wanted

93
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,750
to the problem began really defined onto
uses one assistance for images they want

94
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,860
something that is liable that looks like
sandoz

95
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,990
irrespective of where they are going to
what when did they working with

96
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:03,600
water in my mandate on if they're on a
local boxer than a more books

97
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,449
um with us who want to retain
third-party support is like if you want

98
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:08,960
a VM from hosting company that appear on

99
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,570
you want to be able to get Iran
state-supported image for you

100
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,570
you still want to have the phone number
that you can call because if Iran does

101
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:16,349
something like here

102
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,620
here's the official tempers image all
the best let me know

103
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,550
if you have a problem and just make sure
your credit card is valid and he judging

104
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,850
you

105
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,729
you don't want to be in a situation
where you can get support anymore right

106
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:26,349
which means

107
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,350
we need a consistent platform from the
winders percent of sand from

108
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:34,070
sent us where those vendors across to
the users as well

109
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:37,289
let economic sense yeah okay

110
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:42,400
um to be founded on Cloud enough of
cloud or not

111
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,669
um they don't really look the same
because you have the M's but you could

112
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:46,289
have

113
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:48,759
you could have a VM on your machine you
can have a shred infrastructure you

114
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:49,520
could have a club

115
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,049
by me those three things look very
different which is in perspective is

116
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,759
classics or VMware kinda

117
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,600
perspective cloud is classic he ws kinda
thing where you know eighty may not be

118
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,479
that big a deal

119
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,949
you at your app rather than letting your
instance and and all of them are kinda

120
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:08,160
they look just different enough that um
demerit to consideration specifically

121
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,139
from and of course gonna nap support I
mean our computer on BB do whatever

122
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,780
summit on my secrets and you can run

123
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,849
escalate and people like me to think
that

124
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:21,780
if you only have arm a thousand two
objects that fact by the fine

125
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,119
I'm it is true it's true I mean you know

126
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,030
I'm this is this what a pain that people
go through the setup my sequel with

127
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,729
you know of two schemas and everything
at the net on a blog which is by post

128
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:36,479
right have you tried running flat files
with five lines in it

129
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,068
these days you know what can a
performance you can get there

130
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:43,259
I'm took to basically what we did was we
gotta love that stuff together and came

131
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:43,720
up with

132
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,889
and it's it's called granddaughter
centers are gone we actually

133
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:50,849
launching this as project raindrops
truck net but is also available from

134
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:54,349
from drenched in Russia sent us a call
and to fix what it is

135
00:06:54,349 --> 00:06:57,409
it's a web email and getting to face

136
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,949
um

137
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:04,570
you create a kickstart file and this
looks like magic except by you've got

138
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:08,310
install because what you want to do
things that are different now pointed

139
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:08,780
out earlier

140
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,080
your you are the key installing from has
to have ripple host as

141
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,130
the place is going to pick up on 10 from
because the base happen

142
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,159
privately not available on the Internet
so you have to have that any have to

143
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,530
have

144
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:23,489
whatever the center's marry you are a
list it can be you can use very able to

145
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,490
guide his base are cheap and easily so
Asian

146
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:28,540
has to be fixed 6 and the architecture
that you want or five

147
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:32,479
the architecture everything else is
about what you'd have an enormous

148
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,580
kickstart file you've got

149
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,200
root password which should should
probably keep fairly secure

150
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,440
are unit the device from

151
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,790
okay so the other thing which is prolly
worth mentioning over here is that you

152
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,260
have to partitioning information

153
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,630
and you can set up whichever you want
and you have to have a kick-start which

154
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,440
complete without user interaction so

155
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,150
if you remove for example the network
config line or remove the password fight

156
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,500
if we get stuck anaconda cannot handle
that it takes one aspirin but

157
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,750
so you have to have a pic so far that's
complete is that

158
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:06,100
that gonna clear to everybody is
anything okay now what you also need to

159
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,690
do is you need to create a config file

160
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,710
that does he work that doesn't rain
drops what to do with that

161
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:15,299
x-art fire right in this case it got an
image target rejected that we want to

162
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:15,729
build on

163
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:19,120
now the sounds a bit silly because if
you look back

164
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,250
your URL has that in it what happened is
that we actually deploy

165
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,840
host environment that we're going to
build the image into and you can control

166
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,150
that

167
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:31,380
so you can say I want and and this is me
being completely

168
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,380
fictitious here you can see I want omits
bill

169
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,640
I run on x86-64 children environment

170
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,860
which you can achieve with raindrops we
don't have 'em its bid

171
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,950
which he did it be the best makes bill
in the world I'm

172
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,910
you have to have a UAB which which is
actually injected in if you don't put it

173
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,279
into a dick man you don't use

174
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,310
you right here and then things life is
like easier because you would have

175
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,770
remembered he said to you ladies

176
00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:00,089
just get one I'm you can have a
postscript which is external to the

177
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:03,970
extract if you want something to run if
you want extracted deploy an image

178
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:07,800
instant instantiate the image and then
runescape you can check that yet that

179
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,380
Iran

180
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,310
home should do something which is coming
soon it's not it's not there yet but

181
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:15,050
what he can say is that I want to shed
you and give it give me 30 days

182
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:19,329
and what happen is this particular
conflict by we get reprocessed every 30

183
00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:19,719
days

184
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,790
to get a new image every 30 days this is
not functional yet because we want to

185
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,209
see

186
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:27,859
you want to live in a testing in town
how how we can and look at how we can be

187
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,339
skin

188
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:31,270
and how we can actually get a should be
there which was kinda does the right

189
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:31,650
thing

190
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,709
um the updates yes

191
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:37,849
again is something like if you doing an
install we just need to tell what

192
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,589
or sweet installing I'm having a
basically yes we mean it like cheese on

193
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:44,540
the young updates post in stock it is

194
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,079
you can you can have that you click
start if you want or you could have been

195
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:47,680
here as well

196
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,329
um this is handy when you do
installations for certain hypervisors

197
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:56,729
which would allow us to have Mike per
depositary and kick-start um

198
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,780
kickstart file the 6.5 has to match the
name

199
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,959
but you going to use his or turkey said
you call it you can call it that

200
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,410
given image tag if you want to at
something in need to use work I put by

201
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,360
the target you want

202
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,690
and who you want to notify say this
could be and email address

203
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,690
it ought to be a URL if you want to call
back so if you're

204
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,920
are committing your scripts and you're
committing a kickstart

205
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,939
you can have a URL over here and when
the image is done elected to a call back

206
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,030
in and give you some details

207
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,180
am okay nobody can beat that that's my
email address

208
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,870
um if you were using the Get in the face

209
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,920
this is what he would do you do get at
my image KS

210
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,030
you'd get at your config file it did
commit with

211
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:39,189
be callin space whatever you want and
you do a good push

212
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:42,350
and that it and that will trigger the
bill it across the config file

213
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,810
get the kickstart into place iterative
image and do whatever you wanted to do

214
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,050
this is literally all you need to do to
get imager

215
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:53,589
I tossed for an email notification to
this is kind of like the notification

216
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:54,089
you get

217
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:57,529
the job is complete you get the donor in
the log now

218
00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:00,959
we have finite storage because you have
to

219
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,880
gonna get the hat on and pass it around
to see who would like to donate them she

220
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,720
and infrastructure

221
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,240
and very trade for appeared one for
forking out six machines

222
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,920
arm and and storage boxes have about 1/2
terabyte suspect

223
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,279
this is going public two-and-a-half
database does not last very long

224
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,800
to if you guys do start using it and you
do watch for email notification be

225
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,920
highly recommend

226
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,030
or at least I highly recommend you get
that image within

227
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:27,339
a few hours or maximum 24 hours because
what but it's not happening is when we

228
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:30,250
had the eighty percent high-water mark
which are the leading the oldest images

229
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,890
right now we don't know if that's what
this cannot be hoping it does we think

230
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:37,630
we should be able to retain images for
two to three days

231
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,500
but if has become really popular cause
while at 102 people start eating at be

232
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,040
may not be able to retain images for
very long

233
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,170
to keep that in mind um everything for
time

234
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:50,819
okay the fifteen-minute n thats
literally all there is to it

235
00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:54,740
you get image download it and you can
stand she added on whatever you want

236
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,339
am not but because vendors being vendors

237
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:01,520
still want to read and that ability of
doing a little bit assaulting you know

238
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,939
and whatever way to make it

239
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,390
make it work for you for what you want
to do so we can that a little bit

240
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:09,329
this the base config file great what
you're looking at earlier and so the

241
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:10,400
same

242
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,829
nobody can do it you can add an extra
stanza the config file and you can add a

243
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:14,449
bit more

244
00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:18,130
information in it see you have a blender
which at the moment is only sent us

245
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,449
we're hoping we can add

246
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:23,400
some other people in that as well you
can ask for specific kind of described

247
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:23,860
now

248
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,069
at the moment it's parcero because it
the way it set up to do

249
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:31,189
has ended with you doing a KTM but you
could have to go out there you could

250
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,589
have

251
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:34,959
whatever the format you want arm
essentially there's a

252
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,760
Cucuta QEMU ING and

253
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,970
mind that gets run anything any fight
for my dad came you can handle

254
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,370
the delivery agent with and raindrops
will process it for you and i think is

255
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,089
like getting the correct me if I'm wrong
is what

256
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:51,220
in a fifteen different formats that you
can use with QEMU

257
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,920
I'm if you want a different format if
you can try to bash script which can

258
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,089
take a stand in

259
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:59,569
for an image and ok but whatever format
you want we can bomb that in

260
00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:03,969
you can specify what this size you want
ideally keep this to less than 50 gigs

261
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:04,370
please

262
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:08,660
because provisioning 50 gigs in like for
example of I picked up a lot of space

263
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,469
and I'm I but there is no way to check
on this

264
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:15,800
if you go in take me to get a bite with
a disc the build a machine only have

265
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,130
about 200 gigs

266
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,680
so it a try in I look at that this get a
feeling that it cannot be unlocked by

267
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,239
the take

268
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,339
icon disc president complete on

269
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:27,370
if you want to image compressed you can
ask for a few things you can offer

270
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,079
different kinda formats

271
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:31,870
and this is the coolest because the
thing that took me the most wanted time

272
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:32,680
to write is

273
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,329
the delivery stanza seek another have
this is pick up

274
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:39,739
in which case you will get email with
that you are out saying hey this is the

275
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,940
you are heading down or from

276
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,810
or you could say hows callin callin

277
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:50,010
your I it appears authorization

278
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:53,699
I idea the string the of attack in here
and we're going to have to do is

279
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:54,680
eclectic

280
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,339
login to your account NAWS arm bush that
image

281
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:01,630
into an STD back and it has backed image
and send you an email

282
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,650
with the a.m. at the MIT Kia and the

283
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:08,110
image id: the disc issues obstetrical
and then

284
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,400
you can also have an FTP delivery have
an FTP server at your end you can say

285
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,140
give it to me at FTP colon

286
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:16,209
but all you are a hopefully add a user
ID and password into it

287
00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:20,369
it a try and use an FTP to push it um it
can also do our synch

288
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,610
rsync is dangerous because it requires a
lot of network resources that are into

289
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,339
the don't really want to use rsync

290
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:29,339
we happier with with FTP began arcing
targeted your and you say are single and

291
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:29,980
whatever

292
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,750
it likely out in the image to you and
you get the email notification once the

293
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,930
deliveries complete

294
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:38,020
to hear us pray to be as delivery you
get the email once

295
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,110
the images in a WS arm

296
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,310
and you can had extra stuff like you're
no ipv6 you want

297
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,469
arm you know you want specific mac
address to be used or whatever you can

298
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,560
add dozen

299
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,750
am by deforming he said I wanna cook
interface but the system support a

300
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,240
pretty

301
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,810
home and this is something which is i
guess more relevant to lenders who may

302
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,829
want to have every match coming up with

303
00:14:57,829 --> 00:15:01,329
a public interface a private interface
and a management interface

304
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:04,489
and and this works and the deputy image
at the moment

305
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:07,980
if you want any of those to be set up in
a specific kind away

306
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,130
you can specify a mac Address Oregon
City it if you don't want to give you

307
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:15,660
and and it won't happen as WATD online

308
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,079
how many people have used to open the
pillar in the past

309
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:22,079
read a couple to you guys know what I'm
what I mean greater open every day does

310
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,969
not need contextualization to set up by
peacefully and

311
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:28,189
it converts the mac address and when I P
and the IP is

312
00:15:28,189 --> 00:15:31,610
the court notification of the mac
Address soviet you can literally what

313
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,760
you doing his best to find the IP
address

314
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:39,010
for for the VM does that make sense the
extractions any question anybody has

315
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:46,010
so for I T

316
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,339
answer to the question is how would you
include software which doesn't is in

317
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,520
distributed by sent us

318
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,670
whatever mechanism it may come from
right um

319
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,670
the script that you can run here

320
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,310
would be the script that you would
influence those kinds of things and for

321
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:15,910
example

322
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:19,149
arm if you want to include the Apple

323
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:22,490
repository and you want to install arm

324
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,899
something from Apple what does what does
it provide letter you want to set on IRC

325
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:26,330
d

326
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,920
so what you could do is you could have
that in a script and this would

327
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,680
what you put in over here to be my
script and then when you do you get add

328
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:39,149
you need to have that kept at it in as
well and the only thing is you have to

329
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:39,890
have changes

330
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:44,170
in all the files because the billing
process only checks out that but the

331
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,110
last particular

332
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:52,110
chainset that make sense

333
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,029
right

334
00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:00,329
so the point at which the image gets
created

335
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:04,299
the happens privately but images then
pushed out to a machine

336
00:17:04,299 --> 00:17:08,020
which does have internet access which is
when the script gets run said to the

337
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,389
reason why we have a script up there

338
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:13,380
rather than having it around and telling
people to use it in the poster for the

339
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:13,939
kickstart

340
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:17,169
is that different except I'm there is no
public interface

341
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:21,260
is a public access but at this point
that is because that's how the

342
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:25,589
even the car back and stuff like that
would happen because

343
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:28,590
it's probably for the sake of
completeness is worth pointing out that

344
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,010
you can only do that with the raw file

345
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:34,490
because the other leg if you just wanna
be indeed if I we got a real mounted

346
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:38,870
to do these things and because they
don't have been running on the bill is

347
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:39,399
weak on

348
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:43,389
begun tactic in that sense out of it
barometer there are some caveats

349
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:48,289
arm a lot of these things are not being
tested for at the moment so for example

350
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:50,950
you can to a given in the box image and
delivery to a WS

351
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:55,070
that i'm gonna work because at first it
is not loading it in it there's no

352
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:58,689
meditated secondly the box would be
doing ATM

353
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:02,899
not Sen so if you're looking for CentOS
5 install represent colonel is different

354
00:18:02,899 --> 00:18:04,229
from the sock gon

355
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:08,010
someone who and what we would do is be
very happy to everything we will put

356
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,270
into St for you until you give you
anything done

357
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:14,120
but obviously someone to work to be
kinda hoping that as he

358
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,250
release the stuff out for be day to day
tomorrow love you guys are going to go

359
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:17,669
out there

360
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:21,510
and brake system in as many ways
possible and then summit patches on how

361
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,090
to fix it

362
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:28,279
hopefully it I

363
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:31,340
it isn't the Taurus at the moment
incompetent it's all to hell but the

364
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,899
actual complete stuff is held on

365
00:18:32,899 --> 00:18:36,320
Nazzaro it's a public get a possible
give you the URL for that

366
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,178
arm and the way the thing that implement
it is everything is done as again

367
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:41,299
offbeat dockworkers

368
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:44,830
and there's a concept of BU's sentence
handed out

369
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:48,908
casket to drivers so for example I give
you two a good example of how the

370
00:18:48,909 --> 00:18:49,909
delivery agent works

371
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:53,110
um visited the message that comes
through the delivery queue saying hey

372
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,428
this job ready for delivery

373
00:18:54,429 --> 00:18:57,529
and in the working with workout how my
delivering this

374
00:18:57,529 --> 00:19:01,510
I need to put it into initially been
defaced or do I need to deliver it two

375
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,250
in a BS

376
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:06,610
or 22 send by FTP so it is %um that
there's an FTP request

377
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:10,479
it'll actually fired up that the RV
underscore delivery underscore FTP or

378
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:10,980
SSH

379
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,809
with the UNT and then that script will
do whatever you need to do

380
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:18,100
to make the delivery happen and
everything is monitored for sentence

381
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:18,580
handed out

382
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,970
is that skip exits with a non-zero value

383
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:25,700
weekly that as a tener transfer the
local for the user to see which

384
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,480
essentially means that if you want
arcane crazy stuff that you want to do

385
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,679
order to the HP Cloud guys want to have
an interface that allows us to push

386
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:32,309
images there

387
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:35,649
the king is rated delivery agent for it
which has all that stuff in it

388
00:19:35,649 --> 00:19:38,770
we do have some things which are
available like by fan boat was available

389
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:39,200
anyway

390
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,309
we have the G CloudStack that is
available to you can you can consume

391
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:45,799
so we've gone through this stuff

392
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:49,918
um to the sister that is kinda function
now be but

393
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,549
give him to you mister alexi works
ZENworks VMware works be booked works

394
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:58,158
I'm with with caveat and I'm kinda come
to that in a second

395
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:02,270
OpenStack HP Cloud is consumer because
we have goaded available within

396
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:05,279
an extra depositary seeking use that um

397
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:10,529
stuffed animal to eucalyptus as well arm
got stuck as well I believe you can do

398
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:13,880
a.w.s EBS work in a really weird kinda
way and that

399
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,970
week inject stuff into an SAT instance
we request using your credentials

400
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:21,429
a block device and then the rsync the OS
over to the plot device

401
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:24,480
remove the SSH keys to move the
meditator which isn't a specific

402
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,830
antibody machine for you

403
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:30,189
so this has never failed for me but

404
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:33,770
lot of people tell me there's a bit if
you're doing it but

405
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:37,389
hey you know are saying is the gift of
God rate it works I'm

406
00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:40,229
and openable works because you need
contextualization the mac Address is a

407
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,840
condition

408
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,289
and that can work this is how it all
setup we have a

409
00:20:44,289 --> 00:20:48,179
to deliver the goods repositories which
is not really that at the moment you

410
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:50,779
hoping most people use the web interface
you know that it was reasonable the

411
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:51,320
machines

412
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,270
stores North Salt Lake City Pier One at
no cost or so thanks for that goes

413
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:59,620
um this is gonna how it works we'll be
teenagers from distro

414
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,439
gradually bootstrap Arial install except
for being there and be box where the use

415
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,789
the distribution I so

416
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:09,340
and then booted from that I so do the
install and a couple things we don't

417
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,699
have if I support if you have it in you
PDF I

418
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,289
you know you're most welcome to engineer
that you don't have that support and

419
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:17,179
killed in it is is possible to develop
their

420
00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:20,450
to be challenges hailing handling passes
from kick start fires

421
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:23,649
gonna make you get repositories public
by putting them on get her please

422
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:27,189
you going to be joining from here but do
not put in there because I expect fines

423
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,260
have to have a password and

424
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,658
arm even if it interfered with mb5 for a
city

425
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:36,740
given enough resources began to go
backward from its not good at

426
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,789
I'm images are delivered pre good run
see you need to handle first boot

427
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:44,169
if that's an issue for you if you're
asking for images

428
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:47,169
and if you're in for such a cannot
handle fast food then you need to kinda

429
00:21:47,169 --> 00:21:50,899
do something in the pics are fine
suffers what does not begin

430
00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:54,389
skips injected by loop on this is what
we're would be talking about that

431
00:21:54,389 --> 00:21:58,059
if you specify a post in sports
transcript could be done after the VM is

432
00:21:58,059 --> 00:21:59,260
delivered to the head node

433
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,399
seeking to stuff like in a candle to get
you can get your own

434
00:22:02,399 --> 00:22:05,709
you can do things like if you want your
puppet manifest to be injected into the

435
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:08,970
instance before his liver to you but
that's a good point to do it from there

436
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:12,200
and the entire loggers is available

437
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,210
very soon be going to stock images for
CentOS available to be just want a basic

438
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,159
centers image

439
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,120
you don't really have to go to the
processing and issues public images that

440
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,959
will make available through the process

441
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,409
and is updated every week every month
it's not happening yet

442
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:27,730
arm me wonder can see how scary works
and he might need to get our dedicated

443
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,429
before this

444
00:22:29,429 --> 00:22:32,320
that should happen soon watershed you
that can happen very soon where you can

445
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,559
specify should use that

446
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:36,990
you want want an updated image delivered
to you every month every week every five

447
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:37,429
hours

448
00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:40,730
whatever arm and they just effectively
uses

449
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:45,510
grown at the moment it's not public yet
don't try to use it

450
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:49,669
the challenges with its K um expert in
forty for Minister 22 minutes were built

451
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:53,080
for an image at the moment if you lost a
compression

452
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,620
we do on compression for all images on a
very small machine

453
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,770
because you don't really want to a CPU
cycles during compression

454
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:02,700
which means it could take up to 30
minutes to compress damage before is

455
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,030
available for download

456
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:08,010
um we don't know how how good about that
is but everything else we think is

457
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:12,809
is going to 6k quite well as secure so
we trust images that are coming through

458
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:16,678
um her body is handling is is tricky but
it kinda hoping people do that on their

459
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:17,059
own

460
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:20,280
we doing a double yes we might do the
Rackspace images what the experts got

461
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,010
stuff

462
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:24,280
but we're hoping that you know when this
with a daunting for the other stuff

463
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:29,070
um and be challenges began to ring are
trying to connect a minute I just wanna

464
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,830
quickly let me do one thing and could
you do a demo what we have a pissy guys

465
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:34,250
can take a look at it

466
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,860
receiving come back I'm

467
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:44,860
me out

468
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:48,610
can everybody see that up there

469
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:52,050
to be to log on to the web interface
this is what do you and about

470
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:55,340
raindrops arnett slash logging it is
available right now

471
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,730
please do not send hundreds of bill
instances 288

472
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:03,650
I'm this is going to see where he doing
is

473
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,240
looking at stuff so you can sign in with
endure the other any of the options here

474
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,420
you gonna try and get a few more options
going we don't want to know we what we

475
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,110
don't want to have to verify who you are

476
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:15,330
we kinda trust that could have been
friends have done this already

477
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:20,470
summer try and login with you have
should

478
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:23,760
hopefully work their ego iMac you log in
to get have

479
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,950
at the back to two so that you don't see
me type in my password and acoustically

480
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:27,590
decoded

481
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:31,169
um is within the facebook like at the
moment we've got

482
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:34,380
you God jobs may be set up nine yet

483
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,580
the configuration files nine yet
kick-start

484
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,070
man yet so let's start with the new
except by we have a template

485
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:45,980
setup already so you can

486
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:49,170
change a few things in there if you want
whatever it it you can ever

487
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:53,960
you to give it a name so let's say test

488
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:59,470
one so there's nothing specific in here

489
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:03,580
and kick-start because it's a template
it's actually rendered the I'm

490
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,850
the you are a good day lichte

491
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:11,560
happens here this is this web interface
is really quick really fight

492
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,610
past and is a network over here is very
slow

493
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:18,629
so even yet to go and see it like away
from here you find that it's actually

494
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:19,190
quite a

495
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:22,890
correspond to think we keep pushing
tracking for you with Ian that this is

496
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:26,270
going to act in the face with a git
repository at some point um

497
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:30,190
to go to kick start in let's try and get

498
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:34,150
a configuration file going as well my
doing

499
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:41,150
in the wrong button you go to kickstart
file it just the config file its call

500
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:43,120
this

501
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,370
for the sake of interest the same thing
it said

502
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:53,370
notified by email um

503
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,939
wash this stuff should be is this pretty
standard I wanted picked up and I have

504
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,810
compression turned on 100 and Excise

505
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:03,330
disc with a cue card to foment arm

506
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:08,820
and and no not skipping and they should
N you would happen if I

507
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:15,820
to go back okay sorry we're meeting I'm
hitting the wrong button here

508
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:24,590
second

509
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,370
I'm on between am I going

510
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:44,370
and amidst in do that

511
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,450
back to your country fire should now be
able to who

512
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:57,450
and create a job

513
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:07,950
and they should have a drop down with
our existing and to meet

514
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,700
what what what actually happened is
you've got you can open a job again you

515
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,200
can delete it or you can see the results

516
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,750
which is and you should see results as
things are building I am

517
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:34,220
what's also interesting here is that you
can actually see the status on the back

518
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,000
and workers

519
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:41,290
which are all sleeping at the moment
ditty that

520
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:45,090
accept something it's actually waiting
for the next schedule exposure due to

521
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:47,100
come up hoping that happen in the next
second or so

522
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,149
you see here if I can influence that in
any way

523
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:56,300
I'd actually pulled up the workers cream
for the bill that is going to run

524
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,500
so once the prep happens this is
affecting your training at the back

525
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,350
you got the delivery agent running the
one that I was talking about the

526
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:06,379
suppression system it's kinda like how
it works I'm

527
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:10,540
should also be

528
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:17,070
he builder insincere home to be the
bigger

529
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:22,800
traits that are waiting for the job to
come through we are a time

530
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,220
the order Thai has any does anybody want
to talk about anything in there minute

531
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,360
or two that it takes to

532
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,689
get the below going because a bit only
done it once every five minutes

533
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:37,690
for the shed to come around sure

534
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:45,040
inside

535
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,060
yes so what we'd actually hoping to do
is actually delivered in tirane drop

536
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,080
stack as a VM

537
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,330
within raindrops a tough so you could
say is hey give me

538
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:57,169
Arenacross instance for my cloud stack
deployment and then you have your own

539
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,910
private set up which is already there

540
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:03,300
and thus offers on Fri I think even
talking about open envelope inability to

541
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:03,919
try and ship

542
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,950
a and a VM which runs raindrops

543
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:11,030
from within the open a beer market space
be kinda hoping more people

544
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:14,170
do that as well as an Arctic rush

545
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:17,890
is anything else your talk about

546
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:21,130
we probably won't have time to see this
big running another two minutes to go

547
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:21,980
for the next to do

548
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:25,940
no but thank you for coming along

549
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,970
I highly recommend everybody goes to the
interface check it

550
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:32,910
break it and then submit batches to fix
it please summit that is what we need to

551
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:33,480
focus on

552
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,710
everything else will happen
automatically I think thank you access
