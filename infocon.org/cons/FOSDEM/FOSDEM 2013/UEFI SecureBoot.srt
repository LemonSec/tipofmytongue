1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,030
they don't have to be any OEM

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,430
is doing hardware at the I am level can
control

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,280
can get control and maintain control

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,540
also you need to know what a shame and
is the current solution to find the

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,540
Butlers letter

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:18,000
now Matthew Garrett someone who's most
most prolifically

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,270
talking about this so read up on him on

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,910
if you a are going to it by the end of
this talk you care

9
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,050
about secured now where is it

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,630
it's actually heard word on the
motherboard in the friendship

11
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,870
similar erasable programmable read-only
memory it's a little chip

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,709
cannot remain and last year at million
level annular

13
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,170
telling them hard and factories

14
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,190
how to manufacture unfortunately

15
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,480
why did we switch from the BIOS
teary-eyed

16
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,038
first about the buyouts was clearly
specified

17
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,350
old heil how number one

18
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,239
it needed that day it was giving
everyone headaches

19
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,500
developers headaches having to work with
it it was all

20
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,960
it was twenty to thirty years old is
designed for computers that

21
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,539
are funny and for some other spring up
sentimental

22
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,540
have sentimental value it's time for
computers sitting on the computer

23
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,700
history museum

24
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,909
near Palo Alto Calif if you see a look
here thirty in the bottom and that

25
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:25,979
brings back nostalgia that's when the
original by upstream

26
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,420
I'm number one reason everybody is it
was written because

27
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,700
and security reasons security is an
entirely

28
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,540
different field now I far more
sophisticated

29
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,869
and also Klein no further support am

30
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:44,590
there's three main companies that I'm
supported difficult chip on the

31
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,570
motherboard there's Phoenix technologies

32
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,758
but only the old bios there's American
megatrends

33
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,360
video by Anthony continuing with UEFI
and inside

34
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,799
is the same we on now

35
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,570
the main reason why we're switching is
because

36
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,419
none of us want to stick with the old
high where we all want bigger better

37
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,450
faster stronger

38
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,960
and there's no going back so

39
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,549
why don't men EMS fully understand

40
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,300
on what you re up my security is doing

41
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,440
and how to how to get

42
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,450
a laptop tree and term

43
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,599
free and signing of a Microsoft kitty
and

44
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,220
it's because secure be relies on

45
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,010
various system in

46
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,819
there in the system that on usual
usually developers

47
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:41,049
specifically interested in one segment
in there

48
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:45,700
the only people who have to cross over
all these different and I can read a

49
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,290
statement

50
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,609
the only people who have to cross over
into all these different areas are

51
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,530
people like us to build hardware

52
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,890
and generally people you build hardware
they have to sell it

53
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,000
in order to sell it yet and the company
may become the company

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,440
I'll get to that in a minute your focus
changes

55
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,109
so there really isn't anyone protecting
free and open source software on this

56
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,610
level

57
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,690
okay simple explanation for security

58
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,810
is encrypted key check to see if there
is a certified

59
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,269
matching key senator only certified
execute certified

60
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:23,769
general saying in the community is that
the goal is admirable

61
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:29,170
but the implementation fax everyday life
back not so simple solution

62
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:33,309
is that you can use a tool to generate
your own your own private key

63
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,370
and then you can find question with the
prior your privacy

64
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,569
and for the public key and the bile
slash UEFI people continue referring to

65
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:41,530
it as the BIOS

66
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,760
technically is here that is really want
that is a very simple way of saying

67
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,319
something that

68
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:51,159
actually very of people on

69
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:54,659
for in this room will be able to you
okay

70
00:03:54,659 --> 00:04:00,780
the when and historically this started
in 2000 between 2000 and 2004

71
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,060
people started writing code to replace
not and the company

72
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,080
and inside an American megatrends

73
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,049
started writing code to replace the BIOS
everyone near you can't have a twenty to

74
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:16,160
thirty year old PC can survive into the
future it was not

75
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,669
immortal he needed to be replaced long
time ago so they started creating it

76
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:25,359
in 2005 and industry started
transitioning to it

77
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,990
it started seeing you your fam
ironically the this house for the first

78
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,949
just here

79
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:33,910
adoptee reaffirming the boys we started
seeing you you're funny

80
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,100
arm on from the motherboard at the

81
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,770
hardware building an 8 2011

82
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,198
with math industry adoption on

83
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:48,949
it became a design required to the point

84
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:52,259
parents an this is Ben now I'm it

85
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,380
state in the Union for UEFI and

86
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,190
does 1 2012 systems worshiping with UEFI
nobody really noticed

87
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,940
and on 5th 2012 was kinda

88
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,430
that not really the deadline either

89
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,919
day Windows 8 was launched

90
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,940
and launches been a lot softer than
anybody thought it would be an aunt that

91
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,530
partly it helps to go under the radar
even more

92
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,210
Butlins did started shipping with
security enabled on all Windows

93
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,380
a machines an

94
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,479
so does have some motherboards pasta
that come into force most

95
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:33,080
here my laptop there here

96
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,820
servers the same are you not getting my
messages matter

97
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,800
tablets have a different are
architecture thankfully I'm doesn't have

98
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,419
a bio sitting area by four

99
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:45,948
although let it be noted that Microsoft
tablet

100
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:50,130
I'm and you cannot be atlantic's

101
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,990
on at windows a RT tablet

102
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,370
not possible green understand either
thinking

103
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,669
I'll trade anyway but your break

104
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:04,659
sup and iPhone his arm so

105
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,750
funzies I'm so and thankfully we don't
have to mess with that

106
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,030
from laptop thankfully and come by
pieces Corbett

107
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,948
which might be a potential solution good

108
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:20,360
am were already running into trouble

109
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,610
I'm sure you know him better probably
everyone came across our recently about

110
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,910
Samsung

111
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:28,009
is in that lot is a model and the
Samsung laptop

112
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:31,560
that people have been trying to learn
when exxon tear and lately

113
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,750
pics which will see more

114
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,060
and generally I found that a lot of
people

115
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,470
art actually aware that and if they go
to the store and try to buy Windows 8

116
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:42,949
machine

117
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:47,800
here white pic like moments like these

118
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,430
here's the future this is just a general
prediction not saying it's

119
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:57,169
guaranteed on but this is that this is
the direction that we see it

120
00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:01,440
heading

121
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,849
the prior I wanted to talk to you about
is the last one

122
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:07,849
now one other reason

123
00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:10,960
one of the reasons I'm so passionate
about the start panicky

124
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,599
way is because back then 98

125
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:18,440
I think it was 98-91 permanent

126
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,870
maker sucked into something brilliant
their marketing people

127
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,039
earn did something that from a marketing
perspective

128
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:30,590
is growing for calf from a marketing
perspective

129
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,799
it was from this they put

130
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,050
their logo on the start you start

131
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,349
with Windows traffic on the hong go home
between

132
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:45,000
it became it was so effective that
people with me

133
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,590
heard to the PC back computer

134
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:52,539
as a Windows machine now PC is
indistinguishable

135
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:57,620
family nothing

136
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,770
calling secure beart six-year

137
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,789
which it is about security is the second
time

138
00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:08,560
they're doing they are making their OS

139
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,050
the six-year OS the iranian-backed

140
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:17,800
blows your mind ok

141
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,720
but it with the current trajectory by
2012

142
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,270
winners will be that secure last and
thus we can make some changes

143
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:31,068
okay now this is my passion is how
computers are totally mm

144
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:35,260
I'm not going to go into a huge detail
because it's fascinating for me

145
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,169
and it's probably going for you so
generally at William level there are

146
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,669
several ways you can do it

147
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:45,069
for desktops there are very few hundred
others to build their own cases anymore

148
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:49,510
is generally case get component you make
sure they are working to destroy your

149
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,540
working with

150
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,019
and testing testing testing and they
have agreed to stop

151
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:57,250
with laptop you can no longer

152
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:02,420
kill camp lightbox laptop and byron
components and you might be able to hear

153
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,819
in some parts for the world

154
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:08,010
but over the last five years that phased
out used to be able to do that you can't

155
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:08,339
any

156
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:12,580
any longer arm

157
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,830
so what we do you is that at the OEM
Apple we get them

158
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:20,050
in large quantities so that we can have
control

159
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,670
over how it's built and what to put on
it

160
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:28,729
ok so another part of the house accounts
go how to disable it

161
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:33,019
-ism really basic may or may not be
fully accurate

162
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:37,019
depending on your experience when you do
it if you want to disable

163
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:40,920
secure be on a computer when you get
your next laptop

164
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,140
and a couple years and you can no longer
find an old laptop

165
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:49,300
or niner and a laptop without a new
effort

166
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,300
going to buy a house scepter the UEFI
Senate

167
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,490
it's different for every system
sometimes f10

168
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,190
escape our daily you guys can probably
guess all that now for right now it's

169
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,550
just that one key

170
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:04,689
every computer will be different every
monk

171
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:08,450
term and that

172
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:11,510
the way that you get into the by asking
if I'd

173
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:16,550
is going to change if you look at how
corporations work

174
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,859
that will become this is just the first
step on making a proprietary

175
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,279
thing it would become a little more
complicated

176
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:27,570
crimes in a pot of boiling water you for
the analogy

177
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:31,029
will become a little more complicated
each year

178
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:35,130
fragmenting the population so that we
devote

179
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:38,350
our mental energies to just

180
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,930
treading water rather than fixing the
problem

181
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:45,229
defense period and if they do it

182
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:51,550
you may pick a mission returning if the
system has Facebook enabled

183
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,029
it to them keyboard self-professed

184
00:10:55,029 --> 00:11:00,529
Bay and this is but I am

185
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:05,750
Matthew Garrett he said that the way to
do this is basically

186
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:10,510
you start and restart

187
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,610
that fire there are ways around it for
now

188
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:19,459
and will continue to find ways around it
one of the many situations

189
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:23,069
okay better next time how would you
enabling

190
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:26,130
some people actually may want to enable
it there are

191
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:30,269
and you'll see reasons why an but just
know that for now

192
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:33,769
if you turn secure bid on in any way it
does require any

193
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:37,700
have been it's been an Achilles heel fam
cancer sucker for so long

194
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,149
reckoned so

195
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:45,829
doing there on it what I would love to
see

196
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:49,290
arson better stronger solutions to
secure their

197
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,660
so that as a community and as a force

198
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:56,420
for free and open source software hit
thing just rampant know that many say

199
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,260
that any

200
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,339
also an

201
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:04,620
that I i would like to see and more
solid solution and that's why I'm

202
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,950
going to be asking you questions so that
we're not wasting your energy

203
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:12,610
on each different monolith computer one
of my pet peeves

204
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,940
is seeing because we're

205
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:20,600
puzzle fixers because many events like
the puzzle and getting

206
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,899
our favorite OS to run on whenever Tiger
machine

207
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:27,130
and because you have a very high

208
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:32,000
frustration tolerance level we tend to
spend a lot over

209
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,959
energy getting wanna wear working on one
computer and then maybe she won

210
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,290
one-mile and then maybe sharing that
information and maybe

211
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:44,639
so many other people do that but
unfortunately that has daily dinner

212
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,760
energy to the point where

213
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:54,519
they're here it's meaner honorable to
corporations as if

214
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:57,570
okay so here's the hoop art this is the
biggest party the talk

215
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:01,060
maybe talk about how the distance
subjected to secure Bay

216
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,910
how the aliens are handling it an the
people here

217
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,689
put figure if I could out there what
they're doing and you talk about the

218
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,540
hardware builders

219
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,899
on different levels and sizes you talk
about leaders

220
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:16,120
and yes developers and users

221
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,660
you and your friends and you start with
the last one first

222
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:25,269
users because as I said and like 20 even
in the beginning

223
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:28,850
our user base and is crucial to our

224
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,709
future while back I wrote a blog post

225
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:35,829
sorter tongue in cheek call turn it back

226
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:39,290
and I wrote it right rate for

227
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,339
think in July right before I guess 2012

228
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:45,560
right friendlier feeling the intensity
here you know we

229
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,579
seen secure becoming we knew it was
coming and I

230
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:53,399
windows 8 was lunching in full force our
great advertising

231
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,820
and let's just say it was extremely
depressing I read in there i read my

232
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,600
post culture intact

233
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,970
got pretty good response I recommend
that you read it

234
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,899
and let me know what you think users

235
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:10,510
these are our future users I mention how
secure bared her that the brilliantly

236
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,750
named

237
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,490
how this little bit and proprietary code

238
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:20,579
is being label there are other ways to
secure you don't have to be prepared

239
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:23,680
tonight but

240
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,209
air okay

241
00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:30,899
this user probably or not

242
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:36,100
disable security

243
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,649
because disabling security is bad

244
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:42,769
on the bad people and

245
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:46,000
I have Packers fan I

246
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,690
I get back I love the hacker vibe but in
general people have a desire for

247
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,930
security at the primary

248
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:56,849
constant in human nature disabling
security

249
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:00,810
band and there's secretary-general Inc

250
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:04,050
but these people probably not actively

251
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:07,750
disable a secure future so

252
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,750
our future users a little six-year-old

253
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:15,690
software guy is trying to figure out
what this kernel thing is

254
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,860
here is a the guys started contributing
to their

255
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,449
video card to me mami tank

256
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:26,279
contributing these errors in future
people there are going to be working

257
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,649
with

258
00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:32,740
their five-year-old 100 check like her
laptop

259
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:38,149
things change perception changes when
you're

260
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:43,110
I a point security becomes a feature
instead of just being some fun puzzle to

261
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,399
solve

262
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,639
those kids become habit heavy hitters
tomorrow and

263
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:51,940
they're the ones and you who are going
to make decisions that will support

264
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,579
support our distress anything there

265
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:59,269
thing here in a minute I really want to
disable security if they bring something

266
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:00,829
that secure mix too bad

267
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:04,029
feeds disable security and

268
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:07,519
don't repeat is a sec on a primal level
people create security

269
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,630
this is the card and gotta wonder with
these people have contributed if it was

270
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:15,519
more than just a puzzle

271
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,670
previously treaty winners a patriarch
its 2012

272
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:23,439
all that work that we've done has just
been a puzzler haven't

273
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,209
there then legal issues

274
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:34,209
but nothing like 6am

275
00:16:34,329 --> 00:16:37,519
okay so graphic pictures incoming

276
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,300
brace yourself I mean I just read a look
whoa

277
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:46,229
country attorney can am when you buy
securities implemented million level

278
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,040
only PCs purchase

279
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,920
weird window they it was going to be
there lunch has been that much softer

280
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,050
than

281
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:56,050
what we all thought it would be because
they were getting bad publicity

282
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,949
with the intent to bring your favorite
destroy will have secured beginning and

283
00:16:59,949 --> 00:17:05,099
UNIX and 1980s 1990s up to now required
to luxury

284
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:08,119
and wiping in learning whatever just
really like this David there

285
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:11,599
the ability to flip the bird hearing the
case is that your

286
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,980
centrist universally but the third

287
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,990
at yes thank you that was the prevailing
are given the finger

288
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:22,329
kid that proprietary corporation and

289
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:27,799
if this was secure be done as it is
currently being implemented

290
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:31,150
I'm sure exc

291
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:35,150
that's what it does know the computer
the next part after developer Bay

292
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:39,870
where basically cutting yourself often
lead to find better solutions

293
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:45,199
now this is the most negative aspect and
that this is one way to see it we're

294
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,840
having

295
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,000
our ability to wipe unload our favorite
this trail

296
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,380
flight and that way I don't know but
only

297
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,900
I'm sure your laptops in your hardware
are very personal

298
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,640
they are your lap here icing like your
child

299
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,460
it's very personal here on probably
taking it apart

300
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:08,289
probably had Canada in many different
ways here's the up side

301
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:11,330
planet seems like it's horrible thing
has happened heart

302
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:14,600
seems like the cubic may have heard on

303
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,668
any and if we handle it right as a
community and

304
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:23,280
many different nations that large it
couldn't be

305
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,030
what we've been needing all online

306
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:30,230
and I'm very curious about your pain on

307
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:34,169
because it is the ultimate
differentiating factor

308
00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:39,260
it me free open source software

309
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:42,990
me and not just

310
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:47,230
miss second that the thing that you put
on I mean those wishing

311
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:52,220
it give it an edge that it never had
before

312
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,900
okay so here Creek quick review at the
different distress

313
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:01,660
shuttlers now event am why did they find
something clear Microsoft

314
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:05,590
think about it Shuttleworth right now I
I support these guys they respect their

315
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,620
decision

316
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:10,479
think about it Shuttleworth made here
fortune on

317
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,690
keep not it with their

318
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:18,169
on security code upon which I'll banking
is based

319
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:21,190
piana that that his

320
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,650
area and expertise at this cumbersome
some thank

321
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:28,830
the door I feel so my heart broke when I
read about them

322
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,879
about them making their decisions
they're stuck between a rock and a hard

323
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,950
place

324
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:36,530
they had to decide whether to become
monster

325
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,830
distress have this decision at their
point they're deciding whether to become

326
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,330
obsolete

327
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:46,178
and make impossible for you let's keep
the users to another distro

328
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:49,990
or sign at Microsoft they took a path
that hopefully

329
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:53,770
well turn out alright but

330
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:57,889
now I love offenses say and choices are
there any other

331
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,910
you think I is here okay

332
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:04,909
is mostly be there over different time
almost got them here

333
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:08,179
but they're over at the counter their
answer to it

334
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:11,500
is

335
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,610
and that aired because that the
Microsoft even everybody's changing back

336
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:16,949
to is only part

337
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:20,640
and the verification process it deeper
than that and they're creating a second

338
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,770
they aren't they have fun and make some
picking

339
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:26,090
second level of complexity that earn

340
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:29,899
make mere

341
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,950
from my point of view actually get they
understand the hardware and software

342
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,299
have to be married

343
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:39,059
they understand that you have to go hand
in hand to have

344
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:42,289
stability and that freedom

345
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:45,658
will reside in being able to protect it
act

346
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:49,049
within your actual I country hardware

347
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:52,280
so they launch their own box

348
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,570
on crime Spain and they're still working
on

349
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:59,750
how they're going to respond to it but
the people who are running your

350
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:04,419
are brilliant and I know they'll find
away Debian

351
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:08,600
okay anybody know damian hearing

352
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:15,469
pre years right here up comedian Mike
report

353
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,909
I woodland here your answers

354
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:22,780
yeah this guy right here thank you

355
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:26,270
that in will not why the sign footnote
you have to

356
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:30,870
use and anything out you can get or you
have to disable it

357
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:36,158
okay other what in anything else will
not go get consensus within the project

358
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,799
and we are not legal entities but we
cannot

359
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:43,549
obtain a saying in q3 you want it we had
to do it

360
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:48,090
to SBI and I don't think it's I would

361
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:51,129
go along with that okay

362
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:54,799
creep here

363
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,870
okay curl back energy

364
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:02,199
that's going to push forward toward more
solutions that we're going to talk about

365
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,230
in a few minutes thank you

366
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:10,230
okay the next thing I want to ask you is
what do you know about the other distros

367
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,230
there are many more distracted than what
I lifted

368
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:16,690
anybody have any other back on any of
the other distros

369
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:20,419
man is under the building hardware and
resources that we have

370
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:24,179
were set up in North America right now
and I just finish setting up in

371
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:25,020
Australasia

372
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,150
we're trying to set up in the UK Cory
Doctorow

373
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:33,260
here great actor essentially write a
love letter about us i'm going going

374
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:37,010
and so I was really say to them we've
been getting a lot

375
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:40,039
and your journey a great return EU which

376
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:44,220
for working on it we're going fast we
can sell my job is working on that so I

377
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,210
haven't had a chance to follow up with
the different just as a going

378
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:50,400
as much as I would love to you anything
now

379
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,080
for any of the other districts are doing
appealing

380
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,750
neem okay

381
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:02,870
yep

382
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:06,469
so there was the discussion on Gentoo
dad about this

383
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:10,950
I think the outcome was and no real
decision

384
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:14,940
there a so a bit also wait and see

385
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,090
care and that their there will be the

386
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:22,470
anyway some some solutions and also the
thought

387
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:26,230
occurred that get to users might be able
to deal with

388
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:29,929
I'm situation anyway

389
00:23:29,929 --> 00:23:33,570
and you have to start source for
attention the first place

390
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:37,840
they're going to be pushing forward yeah

391
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,549
second said generally it was kind of
unexpected

392
00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:44,690
I was hoping that their are you human
but

393
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:49,250
generally there's I

394
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:53,990
you get it there's a general lack
thereof here

395
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:57,140
as ever right now as a builder
worshiping

396
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,220
with secure be disabled

397
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:04,450
and I'm gonna talk about some solutions
in a moment

398
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:10,350
if we don't talk about okay so from from
the point of view and destroyers

399
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:14,559
everything went secure with implementing
when we started up in your mind around

400
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:14,908
it

401
00:24:14,909 --> 00:24:18,220
and over the next year people continue
wrapping their minds and

402
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:22,929
it feels a bit like what we've bill

403
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:27,220
what we've bill head can if you're not
in control the hardware

404
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:31,200
what you've built can tell apart the
hardware is there's been to your house

405
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,190
but it hand be taken away

406
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:40,830
and security standards and the reason
we're talking about it is to avoid

407
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:44,080
regret and frustration later okay

408
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,799
just even give a nickel is the number
one media guy his rapping is minor and

409
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:49,830
UEFI secure boot

410
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,879
and I talked to him anything into the
day UEFI secure boot

411
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,330
is far more about locking users and
windows than it is about security

412
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:01,189
its activities for company doing
anything it's want grasp on the desktop

413
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:05,409
frantically trying to hold on to its one
insurmountable in as tablets and

414
00:25:05,409 --> 00:25:07,600
smartphones even PC sales have shown

415
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,059
makes us think using its Chris trip

416
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:14,480
and one another opinion from Apple Inc
reactor

417
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,720
an he the way he talked about it

418
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,720
is that a new PC feature called the UEFI
is making it increasingly hard to

419
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,640
install non-commercial messages on your
computer

420
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,159
feel I feel like you're an inventive
sorry guys are having to pay blood money

421
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:31,549
to make such thing users can install and
repair

422
00:25:31,549 --> 00:25:35,710
OS's without having to lift the lid off
the machine and change their work

423
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:39,150
this is a trend that I see getting much
worse before it gets better

424
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:43,559
now pay attention to that before get
better

425
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:47,220
that they were going to be talking about
in a minute although the right to freely

426
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,620
choose a modifier

427
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:53,399
highly esoteric and technical I it is
the wellspring from which

428
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,470
all other technical freedom a ride

429
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:01,779
she can relate to that okay so now the
hill at the hardware builders their

430
00:26:01,779 --> 00:26:03,350
three different types

431
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:06,699
are small shops that rebrand if you go
to acquire sup

432
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,760
that bill and the nu-

433
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,429
time does your computer that runs
whatever on

434
00:26:13,429 --> 00:26:19,220
I'll probably put together the component
contestant it works for you

435
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:23,490
were in the middle categories reasons in
a category medium subsidy them build

436
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:27,230
go to OEM level they're still small were
some really smart

437
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:31,309
that they go to you but actually there
on time hardware million level

438
00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:34,799
work with manufactures and in China

439
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,029
and elsewhere and there's a major
corporations like

440
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:41,260
down angle he convinced his side by side
but

441
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,830
does that mean to you juxtaposed I think
this is a

442
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:48,620
where her builders in Berkeley Calif
we're setting up a little shops like

443
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:51,889
this globally I can send me the North
America and South America

444
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:57,190
other some other people and the reason
why we're setting up a small shops

445
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,450
rather than major corporations

446
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,490
now none appear probably ever heard the
call tech support

447
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:08,620
I think the friends that you how bout we
do have to call tech support

448
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,959
you don't have to help them you want to
be able to talk to this guy

449
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,559
you wanna you want them to be able to
talk directly to the guy who built your

450
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:16,059
machine

451
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:20,070
are the guys who actually happened
answer is actually very familiar with

452
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:20,990
the machine

453
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:24,130
so what we're doing everything at the
company very differently with very low

454
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,590
overhead to make sure that

455
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:29,439
the person you're funny cuts to the
person who made it

456
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,159
mixer so earn

457
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:39,370
pretty clear do

458
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:44,500
on the guys think so herder builders now
there are now

459
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:48,450
we're a corporation there is a fan

460
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:52,149
it US corporations are evil

461
00:27:52,149 --> 00:27:55,678
for her no way around it on so if you

462
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,090
here conflict in my life that's why and
it's very hard to be

463
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:02,590
good corporation in the US that's why

464
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:05,689
that's why we're not building a base in
the US

465
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:09,250
I think air bases in New Zealand has
governed by different line

466
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,980
and but having as separate distinct base
in each country

467
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:16,289
around each country shoes how

468
00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:20,299
those computers are governed within the
country you actually have a voice

469
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:23,580
here there in your help government
ethical

470
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:28,870
so hard for builders am

471
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:32,750
you've seen the efforts towards making
free and open to the list of course

472
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,539
making them

473
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:36,710
biggest headway with its comeback and

474
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:39,850
partly because the potential inflation
now raise your hand

475
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:44,939
if you had seen the corporation on come
on come on come on

476
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,210
certainly 5 percent you guys okay I big
year

477
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:52,279
I'm beg you to go home and see the
documentary called the corporation

478
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:56,730
what they did okay so in the US a
corporation is treated as an individual

479
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:00,960
it's given the right for the human
beings fell Corporation is a human being

480
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,610
if the company is right here it would
have the right an actual human

481
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:08,279
his taxes like a human that has on the
right so what they did

482
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:12,940
but the document million acres did they
said well actually worth a human being

483
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:16,340
and we sat down in front of a
psychotherapist

484
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:20,309
well with the cycle therapists would be
think the healthy human being

485
00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:23,789
I think the kind person they went
through it

486
00:29:23,789 --> 00:29:27,669
it come at the expense of the diagnostic
Statistical Manual for

487
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:31,340
mental disorders corporations are
psychotic killers

488
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:36,709
I'm not I mean literally literally
because by law

489
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:40,679
they are killing there peers

490
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:45,159
their goal is to dominate can be by line

491
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:48,659
they have to you and that the Furious
part

492
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:51,860
if there is no limit for their earnings
David Bain

493
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:55,240
on have to you

494
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,110
earn profit if they do not their
shareholders can see them

495
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:03,029
say this structure the lines that govern

496
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:06,529
corporation are such that the
corporation have to be even though I

497
00:30:06,529 --> 00:30:10,220
don't believe that everybody that works
a mix of bad I'm sure there's still some

498
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,190
good people

499
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:14,830
work there when they first started out
they were really cool seriously I grew

500
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,178
up

501
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:18,029
your Microsoft when they first started
out there hurting really cool

502
00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:19,580
programmers there people that like

503
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:23,330
around with and then they started hiring
more lawyers and programmers and we've

504
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,408
had really really like this because i
three my

505
00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:29,130
Michael so that with cannon fire wake-up
call

506
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:32,370
it's something that was a ride on I

507
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:35,889
I beg you watch the corporation it will
give you some in night

508
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:41,090
into how UEFI secure boot is going to
progress

509
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:47,549
and how your accessibility to free and
open hardware is going to change

510
00:30:47,549 --> 00:30:53,370
okay so I'm going to make a quick
announcing have any Beaufort month ago

511
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:57,010
your okay so that the now if you are
unsure thank you

512
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:59,890
there to think I care about my
electronics in my face occur that

513
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,919
they're both here

514
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,380
okay those buildings look relatively
similar we got here my husband and i got

515
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,120
your day early and major

516
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:12,110
Marilyn and lo and behold I took a
picture that building

517
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:15,610
month end up going to straighten your
hair the building

518
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:20,860
in a min now here's the part that will
also hopefully play my music my second

519
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,209
blow your mind point

520
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:27,120
Microsoft is a software company

521
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,500
that controls the hardware industry for
one

522
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,350
industry to control another but not even
have a successful product in it

523
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:38,189
is all all a fifth software company

524
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:41,880
that has managed to position themselves
in a way that controls the hardware

525
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,860
industry

526
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,969
but has demanded the risk there is risk
and hardware

527
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:51,309
you get bad bad around the things you
get bad

528
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:55,139
and I'm memory sticks you get bad
whatever there rifkin for playing

529
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,039
hardware

530
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:00,809
month included seem being they control
the food chain

531
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:04,320
both with the herbicide there but for
the pesticide and reducing

532
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,649
but they have none of the risk if
there's a drought if the farmers who are

533
00:32:07,649 --> 00:32:08,739
screwed

534
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:13,330
a parallel couldn't be better

535
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:18,240
so let's see how we GNE monsanto is
further progress then we can secure be

536
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,809
on among them to provide fifty

537
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:25,600
in many countries ensure many read about
their sales pitch their picks there's

538
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,469
magic bean

539
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:29,980
are not allowed to any you heard about
the suicide

540
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:33,220
an don't cope with a month ago

541
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:36,539
from farmers here have unfortunately
invested in

542
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:40,260
the feed and then had years to cap
because they were the ones here

543
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,679
take the risk surface one genetically
modified canola

544
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,750
spring to the world but one thing to do
about it for merging

545
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:51,750
and of course content they want to
change essentially wanted

546
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:56,750
if month and I don't know but if my
fantasy

547
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:00,919
the go into the are into the on

548
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:04,000
farmland I'm in neighboring farmer

549
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,530
they can be shut down and see

550
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,460
ironically they both start with him so

551
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:16,970
an the ninety as far as I know

552
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:20,880
their aren't any countries yet center
has not come

553
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,620
are set up in & Company New Zealand
thinking

554
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,729
here they don't use herbicides and
pesticides

555
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:32,280
is term spirits baby

556
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:36,820
and it is very popular and very
wonderful month center is Iranian phase

557
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:40,860
to you there so

558
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,840
maybe from the island yet I don't so

559
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,800
day their penetration month and go into
the market has

560
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,940
twist in our minds back to the point
where we no longer actually identify

561
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,120
feared

562
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:59,469
this is face but this actually isn't

563
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:02,670
infinitely modified if you read a list
that chemical

564
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:06,610
I'm I'm legitimately fell while ago hit
me a little

565
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:09,779
phone app concrete free guide for their
I don't get

566
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,179
point in my life nearly everything so
many things lifted

567
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:17,418
chemical any minute with you have here

568
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:21,040
phiri of course in order to get that he
thinks your trip

569
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,520
winner but and it with

570
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,060
our perception there

571
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:31,130
is it here if eighty this

572
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:34,899
if your computer that you can open up
and you can mess with and you can't find

573
00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:35,319
where

574
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,330
neck

575
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:43,830
so the another part of the huge chain I
didn't put that entirely clear what more

576
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:44,770
time at the end

577
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:48,380
but retailers are at the very

578
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:54,350
and a chain on he generally that you
know

579
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:58,880
it is what it is and electronics are
what they are because that's what people

580
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,250
request because that's what people after
for

581
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:06,730
am but

582
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:10,490
I don't know about you but I would
rather not trust the general public

583
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:14,040
to keep my hardware free and open at
myself for free and open

584
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:18,420
other that's just one part of the answer
to another party going into turn

585
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:23,380
sincere probably haven't gone enhance
your own hardware built at a factory

586
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:27,430
I'll tell you first hand that factories
are beholden to no one

587
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:30,589
this is an email that we got

588
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:37,590
from one of our factories we're trying
to get

589
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:41,760
Sun hardware retreated this is an early
days you're trying to get them harder

590
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,900
that we didn't have to but didn't come
with me. not like that we didn't have to

591
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,010
wipe windows of

592
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:49,030
and that's what they told us don't worry
about it

593
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:54,390
okay may be home until now one

594
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:57,870
the only so if we can have and I don't
care if it's even

595
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:01,980
me up weeping see people who actually
care about freeing up

596
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:06,030
so sup open source software on the front
line at the manufacturing level

597
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:11,600
then and we can find ways and security
and this is my home

598
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:16,520
this is the picture the very first Maker
Faire have any event or anything repair

599
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:21,310
first-year here yes thank

600
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:24,910
okay third-year Disney was very pleasant
but

601
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:28,129
and now the first first couple years ago
K

602
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:32,090
youth how many did occur bill your
desktop me

603
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:37,400
okay the No one goes into it building on
desktop you can still there

604
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,310
building your laptop not so much
building your own family

605
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:45,480
Mary okay so you can do it

606
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,600
I mean Kickstarter you could possibly
have done something on Kickstarter

607
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,330
Kickstarter

608
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:52,750
up doing Ren Faire and good

609
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:56,820
if you wanna get nine and you don't get
a whole lot of friends who wanna

610
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:00,570
exactly inspect you could possibly get
them talking about solutions

611
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:04,750
there you know what you can do to work
around secure Bay I'm

612
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:08,550
but the maker the maker

613
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:11,810
feel is cue

614
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:15,470
far away from where it needs to be to
solve this

615
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:19,399
Kelly and Michael okay

616
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,950
news flash hardware and software 99

617
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:26,029
fly here ignored

618
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:30,700
the problem anymore unfortunately and
educating the public

619
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,580
not mission if every single one ever

620
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:39,259
here was able to cite off the top of my
head find ways to get around me if i fix

621
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,360
every problem

622
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,960
on a computer that your I know

623
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,960
you can do your parents or something
bought it best fire whatever store next

624
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,510
week

625
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:53,340
then on then I would say that possibly
educating the public is a problem

626
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:56,540
but it has a community where having a
hard time wrapping your mind and

627
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,890
that's not the way to go okay

628
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:03,160
summit Creek simple summer you guys
think is good

629
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,149
secure this program for many it
complicated to the point of being in

630
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:06,680
danger

631
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,020
from the world's worst problem were born
out

632
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:14,460
complex situations they were just a real
too complex cue

633
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:18,360
communicate to the public i cud French

634
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:22,100
at my alma mater and and Dean

635
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:26,170
and the French school fed it for every
grammar rule

636
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:30,360
you have to be able to explain it in one
sentence weekend simple way

637
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,650
and here you don't understand same

638
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:37,360
53 have to be able to get to the point
where we can understand that if not we

639
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,950
have to use in crutches we have to use
another solution

640
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:45,600
I'm get around Europe

641
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,460
okay so here's a primer I now mine

642
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,560
solution okay and then getting

643
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,029
we can implement better now all three of
these

644
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:59,600
started out with fairly poor initial
implementation

645
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,930
and the smooth down that's just
something where you

646
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:07,200
as initial bumps in the road and then we
get you sick

647
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,879
right Christopher Corbett now Corbett
was gonna

648
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,990
hopefully be the ultimate solution still
maybe

649
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:17,240
Google is a large corporation so

650
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,419
when I'm 100 percent sure about that
precourt

651
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:25,060
free crime but we didn't have the
support fire manufactures

652
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:30,290
the guys who are working on Corbett are
manufactures and talking with in town

653
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:31,490
Andy

654
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:36,279
and media and how it goes something

655
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,290
can't get attract if if you what you
need

656
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:44,440
and my fear

657
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:48,730
very be you can also do here in this
room

658
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:52,070
is where the potential solutions because
simulator

659
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:56,930
there won't be any more finishing proven
abilities to buy

660
00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:00,990
the simulator we have to do with this
thank you very much into

661
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:04,000
they can possibly they can be and
whatever leaders

662
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,150
since the users only start sourcing days

663
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:12,260
not only is important from

664
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:15,380
one deletion we just under on their way
here

665
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,390
actually I don't know even week

666
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:22,069
things sisters can make their own key
actually not that hard for this

667
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,860
tournament at some key

668
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:27,140
in the early AM thank you jackie is that
key

669
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:30,450
so if you know any different to get
around it

670
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:34,200
let us know am we're not we r
corporation

671
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,450
but we have no investors shareholders

672
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:41,089
trace me everything make a quick I love
affair

673
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:44,450
real things that make a corporation evil

674
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:47,720
and the stuff we do every day we don't
do it we don't

675
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:51,200
proprietary stuff like

676
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,859
it makes life so much nicer okay sup

677
00:40:54,860 --> 00:41:01,860
really quickly to any you have any other
stations yeah

678
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:06,860
okay if even a third of the people in
this room supported Corbett that would

679
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:07,230
be

680
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:10,720
more than sufficient as far as developer
power

681
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,600
go

682
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,890
did you get get good I did you check
your email the last two days

683
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:22,339
me did you check your email the last two
days

684
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:25,730
Catholic question angry here

685
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:28,790
basis because I checked don't doesn't
mean if okay

686
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:31,880
yet so I think gmail about about 42

687
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:36,610
I'm yeah I think might decide campion's
not come you no matter how you look at

688
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:39,100
the he needs it

689
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,759
think thank you I i would love to talk
to you maybe a fine maybe

690
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:47,720
me you know about 40 I've been involved
in the project for something like eleven

691
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,669
years and I

692
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:52,070
I was that could impact in Taipei and
talked about up

693
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:55,930
odiaum about this a.m.

694
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:59,600
that was in 2008 or 2009

695
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,130
2008 and at the moment we didn't have

696
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:07,850
as you say any sport from her crib
vendors yes and named Ian Intel

697
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:11,740
with it had some support from the effort
not enough that has changed

698
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:15,850
that's so in the are very much
supporting reboot

699
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:20,230
good yes very good we have they have
contributed ag's

700
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:23,350
code I don't know if that with anything
people yeah

701
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:27,529
him their reference code that goes to
the IP beast to

702
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:31,200
inside and Phoenix and any the bias
companies

703
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,120
to corporate under yes the end you go to
a license

704
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:39,430
so and they also promised to continue
doing this

705
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:42,600
for all Cummings chipset

706
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,980
as he views they they see that they have
an advantage

707
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:51,100
there do that so that's great as you
mentioned Google they have been great at

708
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,259
contributing

709
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:57,170
code for Intel your however it's not
complete

710
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:01,560
there's so that and and this is true for
both Intel and AMD actually

711
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:05,250
we are now at the point where the
hardware components themselves not even

712
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:05,790
the mainboard

713
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:09,590
the hardware components contain Coast

714
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:14,880
many computers need a firmware that no
one has the source code for

715
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,410
it's similar to see if you mark boat but
its maybe even

716
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:23,109
its expected even once the what's the
pre and

717
00:43:23,109 --> 00:43:26,150
and this code to give not even

718
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:30,440
even Google that even though they have
the full documentation and so

719
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:34,200
yet the problem a.m. you mentioned

720
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:38,730
I'm yes that's part of why I don't think
much time I want to make two comments

721
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:42,500
what about Dell I had the opportunity to
talk to Shuttleworth

722
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,090
about 30 some some time ago years ago
and I

723
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:49,840
I asked him okay would how do you see
the situation

724
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,270
he said that he went to tell and he
asked them

725
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:57,130
about getting corporate for Facebook
time at the time that was

726
00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:01,000
his motivation the answer he got back
with that Dell is actually not a big

727
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,030
enough customer at their

728
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:05,420
0 %um to to get court which

729
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:08,470
on the reference designs that a

730
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:12,009
that they package yes now yeah yep

731
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:16,060
today yeah it depends on how your
company is structured

732
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:19,340
and that why I'm growing very thin and
mom

733
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:22,970
companies because my corporation like
the only girl

734
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:26,770
when they grow large and have a large
base

735
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:31,620
than their definition and large is
completely different but if you grow a

736
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:32,710
company

737
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:35,740
and international in a place like doable

738
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:39,129
yes this I agree i think is you're doing
the right thing different

739
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:42,200
a yeah by the way thank you so much for
coming here and

740
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,339
talking about this this is hugely
important thank you up

741
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:51,330
Corey a.m. you please go back to the
corridor perot structure

742
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:54,720
ok many saw that did you

743
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,000
now a good as an answer to a trivia
question

744
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,160
actually could you do this why did a
trivia question take on

745
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,350
effect pressure

746
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:08,950
and your

747
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:12,140
okay the trivia question I get there

748
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:16,000
I am going to pick the first person who
I C

749
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,580
they can raise their hand and tell me

750
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:24,120
who wanted the very first programmers

751
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,990
and I'm talking to eke greater

752
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:31,899
now I'm like million on okay

753
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:35,740
now I'm part good I wonder simple prayer

754
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:38,810
I don't you think anthracite in

755
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:42,380
on curing now

00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:47,380
I have my life there pics here now not
only are you get that now

757
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:50,480
on eniac they had six women

758
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:57,480
encouraging their called computers
because they were with your computer

759
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:02,500
I don't know and I'm this is not now

760
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,850
great number is not one of the first
became a little bit later

761

00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:25,910
here well I love it it is so

765
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:29,370
funny so the there were he is that guy

766
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:33,299
engineers are very cool graphic their
little pocket protectors mechanical

767
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:34,190
engineer cell

768
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:38,680
I can we get that and they had the women
you know plugging in the kids and

769
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,620
actually doing the computing and they
called them computers

770
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:44,870
and later they change the computer to
the actual hardware

771
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:48,060
and the women to be the programmers I
was just a bunch in

772
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:51,370
women who actually doing and they did
pair programming

773
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:55,060
and I got your Jean Bart acres my
favorite I got to hear her speak

774
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:59,230
at the Computer History Museum and she's
got a better memory than I am she

775
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:04,020
eat something and she sparky and
originally the reason why

776
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:07,850
so few people know the original
programmers it because an article

777
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:11,140
they showed the women working on the
computers and they thought they were

778
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:12,140
just models

779
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:16,529
first articles written about them

780
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:19,810
completely ignore the fact that they're
the ones actually doing the competing

781
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:21,049
and it wasn't and tell

782
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:25,270
I don't know how many years ago good
news or good and media person died in

783
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:25,960
Prince Edward

784
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,280
actually curtailment actually doing that
and I thought that's funny

785
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,350
but I like that one a get-rich-quick and
Corey

786
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:37,810
members earnings good

787
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:41,850
think this it took me a minute to get
there 55 got perfect score

788
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:46,600
good figure

789
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:51,650
just really quick I basically saves it
is it keep would-be

790
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:56,480
from cheap I E yeah I think but
basically keep from cheap size you want

791
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,200
to show you the reader is able

792
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,939
sector do in the flesh cheap in get
flash chip

793
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:06,930
I'm infectious yeah it's been out
basically given up for research is again

794
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:08,839
doing is based and modify news

795
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:12,220
stop him where some I cool of the basic

796
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:15,540
weekend is upon us the big problem
carport is it's a memory unit

797
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:20,170
makes it easier to epic that reverse
engineer right manage that uses regional

798
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:22,020
generation i think im

799
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:26,650
I right you might need my name is like
this had been in pain and the 101

800
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:29,860
I can remember that pH going I'm grub
container

801
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:33,320
okay I even me please and

802
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,710
had a problem basically good reason I
managed to

803
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:39,850
in h2 base gonna put scoreboard

804
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:44,020
by using some by separation of bias
beach at BGC

805
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:47,100
efficiency look at these direction put
also bring

806
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:50,759
not the competition but but but the ONS
work and it's also

807
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:54,360
could be a way to more defy sixties on
the computer to put

808
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:57,960
your own because from technical point of
view

809
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,280
but this acute would be some sick bitch

810
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,290
would be completely fine exit and user
control to keep

811
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:08,200
and user can choose his key there would
be no problem

812
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:11,890
wat exact problem is that Microsoft key
and a right because

813
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:15,960
here because the victim modifications it
go would go in this direction

814
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:21,250
yeah and many other people in year will
be generating their own keys I'm sure

815
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,010
nothing getting around it that way

816
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:27,060
you can generate your own key and it
overwrites to make sucky

817
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:30,930
but that doesn't solve the problem and
incoming users

818
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:35,870
and I didn't focus too much on this
issue I want felt badly for energy to go

819
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:38,420
towards making installation work for

820
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:42,000
our moms and dads and i cant that the
people that

821
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,170
released in tech support for make email
me free

822
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:49,090
that is brilliant getting on that level
could be a huge fish

823
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:52,340
gotta go back to good yes so a just
picked the

824
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:55,740
running out of time the right to freely
choose and modify your kernel is highly

825
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:56,669
esoteric technical

826
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:59,910
it is the wellspring from which all
other technological freedoms

827
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:04,259
arise a take that step further because
the kernel isn't the first thing that

828
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:04,930
runs

829
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:08,100
on a ship so we

830
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:11,950
really need to take control over the
firmer and I i would like to

831
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:15,629
as I said I've been advocating with for
a very long time

832
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:18,690
and I find that it I can make my point

833
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:21,780
with the individuals that I meet but
these

834
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:25,350
please supports that reason because
meager

835
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:28,610
the problem is that we're not we are a
country yet fell

836
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:33,150
knowing I K but economic situation so if
you can then help let me start up in

837
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:34,130
more companies

838
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:37,260
error in more countries this is the way
to do it

839
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:40,550
I think them Ford kinda different

840
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:44,050
but anyway I'm gonna let people know
thank you so much for coming and coming

841
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:44,300
up

842
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:49,569
well
