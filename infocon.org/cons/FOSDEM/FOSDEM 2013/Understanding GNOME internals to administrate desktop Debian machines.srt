1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,250
K well thank you for coming the stock
was not announced

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:06,600
to in this is why we don't have many
people

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,620
a so I came to the 22

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,790
since the last time a giver I give this
talk

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,160
it is about understanding no internals

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,500
to administrate this top didion machines
who

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,560
come it can apply to this supply next
machines

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,070
in the general case so

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,530
why the stalk am

10
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:41,010
we know that and began is quite
widespread when

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,070
you have environment with a lot of
machines

12
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,570
and there are good reasons for that we
have

13
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,960
automated deployment tools easy
customization

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,489
administration tools and reliable system
to

15
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:00,089
to give to to use a

16
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,590
and workstations are getting more and
more

17
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,280
good use case over Linux is to

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,799
minor player on the desktop side a

19
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,150
is getting ready interesting to
administrate

20
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,979
Linux latest stop machines

21
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:22,979
so the easy way I'm what many people do
with that

22
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:26,650
okay to give you to give you machines
with administrative permissions

23
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,619
and these anyway these Linux users new
targets to begin

24
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:33,619
began you with a any problem this
themselves

25
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:36,810
a when you have a lot of users of course

26
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,600
it doesn't scale and you come have any
kind of peace and supports

27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,970
so a

28
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48,110
logical way and a secure way to deploy
workstations to be

29
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:52,130
really stand on workstations with no
specific permission is given to use or

30
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:52,619
so

31
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,759
it means you need to add to do the
restriction for them

32
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,920
and a there there is a

33
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,979
saying about a gnome that

34
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:07,090
it is not easy to administrate I will
show you that it is wrong

35
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:12,310
and our on the contrary a lot of tools
to make it easier for the industry to

36
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,750
who work

37
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,819
to delegates permissions configurations

38
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:23,129
and whether so this to be useful for

39
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:27,489
people who want to ministry their own
machine as well because the mechanisms

40
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:30,930
are the same but was is a

41
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,040
easier the I will not give

42
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,599
a complete course a over that because it
would take several hours

43
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:42,170
but I will you entry points where

44
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,849
you feel you need to look at when you
have a problem

45
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:49,250
when you need to configure something and
then

46
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:56,250
by digging you will find where is your
problem

47
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:00,940
so first will deal with the base
plumbing

48
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,270
beef this term with call

49
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:08,160
going but so long ago but three popular
and

50
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,150
the user settings how to set default
settings military settings

51
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,470
login management password management

52
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,650
networking very important and

53
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:26,140
run them other stuff that you might want
setup so

54
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,489
I am this these are the focuses of my
talk

55
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:35,880
a doing 2.0t in squeeze gnome 3.4 in
wheezy

56
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,030
and the the classic known 2.4

57
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,060
also in wheezy the be tough

58
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,860
the to get specific stuff in that but
should apply to

59
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:52,860
all these longer shins as well so

60
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,120
first plumbing the most basic looming

61
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,410
the one is used by the basically
everyone every

62
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,430
single application know now is divers

63
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,680
what is the birth but the best

64
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,880
a at the base

65
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,620
it is messaging system a typed misting
system

66
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,079
to you send a message to recipients

67
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,840
a and you can pass different

68
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,440
better values with types is very
important

69
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,710
because it is done at a cost up speed so
you should not use the bus

70
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,479
for worth spews critical butts a

71
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,960
your data is safe because it would not
be accepted

72
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,479
on the other side if the type look much
Inc no

73
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,610
it is not use of course that the
messaging system a

74
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,780
percy it is used as the or PC system

75
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,119
remote procedure call so what happens

76
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,540
a.m. is

77
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,690
you your yeah

78
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,820
three you have to buses

79
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:09,010
who these buses because the the bus is a
place that some tries this communication

80
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:13,550
so messages will go away to the birth so

81
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,510
you have other system both he started at
Boots a second bus

82
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,950
which he started right before you log in
and/or the

83
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:25,680
exception and you can start up

84
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,330
system services all session services
which will

85
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:33,289
reduced our name to simply a

86
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,990
you have two ways for example that we're
gonna go

87
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,260
is a demo which starts at Boots and
release doesn't name

88
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,310
and it is accessible to the name all

89
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,360
got free to stop that network whenever
but

90
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,680
it is also possible to ultimately
start-up

91
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,020
a service so to demonstrate here and it
will be started

92
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,169
you note who I'm so to requests

93
00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:01,289
and be sold for both system the rooms on

94
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:05,210
for sister session DeMint's so

95
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,909
these are the fis a would be fine what

96
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,410
binary to spoon if you want to access
the service

97
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:17,330
divers implements basic permissions
management

98
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,400
depending on the to call you want to
make the

99
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,190
you can see these about group is
authorized to make that cool

100
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:27,979
the but it's not way way be used because

101
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:33,260
we have something much better his police
ticket

102
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,300
for consultant police ik its

103
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,530
a are the offer basis for the plumbing

104
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:44,400
consul kate is a demo and which keeps
trucks of users

105
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,530
it knows really you it knows

106
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:52,669
which user is logged on from where on
what total to me know

107
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:56,240
I'm work processes it is using

108
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,830
will be spot doesn't work very well a.m.

109
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,260
so the city early sessions comment will
give you

110
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:08,770
released of running sessions and you
will see that one of them is active

111
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,070
I'm the active cistern has more

112
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:15,650
permissions and other ones and mmm

113
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,109
for example the the active system will
automatically

114
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,670
get a specific permissions for a lot of
devices

115
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:27,200
for example some devices were
automatically get

116
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,680
required permission for the user of

117
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,550
the active session and these %uh change
dynamically you switch BT

118
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:37,920
permissions these appear so

119
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:43,140
so he's got a.m.

120
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:47,490
in case he would replace Council kits by
a system the look in the service

121
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:50,790
a because a lot of problems sconce ok
it's

122
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:54,320
especially it with no or processes

123
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,810
another just the session concert it's
only knows the process

124
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:02,720
that started the system while system the

125
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,030
by using C group can though the the
whole session ernie can say

126
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:10,299
this process belongs to be secure and so
I can give

127
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:15,880
to these process permissions for the
system

128
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,500
police acute a its this one is not
really

129
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,040
at their own it's a it's a mechanism
where there is a demand but

130
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,490
its its more the mechanism to add
commissions

131
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:31,440
to the bus it arose for much more
flexible permissions

132
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,099
so it we're up deeper schools so it is
not visible from the application itself

133
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,140
the application uses the birth and

134
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,280
in incentive the system serviced talks
to the police

135
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,500
rubble and the

136
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,450
the throttle a will well as the name say

137
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:53,560
it will apply policy for the policy can
be fine either by the system

138
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,449
by the administrator or so to

139
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,560
to you the political policy is

140
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,689
in these directories and it can also
look at

141
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:08,370
were with her the application calling is
ineffective session

142
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:12,339
so in in this case you will have more
permissions

143
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:16,720
and it will also be able to ask for a
password for example you want to do

144
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,870
from Peter quick Wales root privileges

145
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:24,089
in no way with police acute you will
have a root process running on your

146
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:25,230
exception with

147
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:30,709
is generally Reese recip for security
disaster

148
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:34,209
so it was only asked for the root
password in the

149
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:38,729
in the use the system uses using the use
of police acute agents

150
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:43,810
so euro the good no matter of getting
agent old name for itself

151
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:47,250
can act as the police ticket agents to
the

152
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,250
so that the the title books he's

153
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:58,040
in looks better in them

154
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,069
so police ticket a Los

155
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:05,230
very easy to tune the policy these are a
few selected examples

156
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,290
for example so

157
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:11,390
by default you are low to to

158
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:15,050
shut down the session on should on the
machine on if you are the only user

159
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,479
and this is good for this stuff machines
but maybe

160
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,570
you have machines with multiple users
benefits

161
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,940
who is to say and you don't want that so

162
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,420
you gotta know the active user views or

163
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,959
log on the machine to always being able
to shut it down regardless

164
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:36,930
%uh with other people are using it to 69

165
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,469
a or you can eugen

166
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:45,810
delegate one unique group permissions to
manipulate the CPU frequency for example

167
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:50,900
a you don't want you want to win
benchmarks so you don't want the CPU

168
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,000
frequency to

169
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,130
Kane and the user this way can look for
the CPU frequency using

170
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:02,890
abandon affect all you can do the gates
permissions

171
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:07,090
with APT mm and delegate package
installation

172
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,310
to one user so you can do group

173
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:14,380
user group or a active inactive

174
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,110
selection in to see it

175
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:23,210
will be much more complicated a well not
everyone agreed with this change

176
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:26,700
including myself but the advantage the

177
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,130
is that's a in addition to pick a really

178
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,140
fights it will support JavaScript

179
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,620
retreats in replacement but I don't
think we can do without

180
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,780
Calif knife a so

181
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:45,050
JavaScript a will allow you to set
permissions not only

182
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,219
according to the to the actions

183
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,520
you're requesting butts a

184
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,240
also true the to the permit to us up his
action

185
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,510
so for a good example hero you will you
wouldn't know maybe

186
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:03,790
to this is the city because he select or

187
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,910
you would be able to say this user can

188
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:10,130
said if we can see two that that user to
another for

189
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:14,000
quincy of course issues that's but I
mean you can't dig

190
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,390
much deeper a into permissions

191
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:21,560
the management and also you can make it
today at Miss

192
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:28,560
if you move to write too many kinda
sweet fights

193
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,910
in bloom 2.0t and Steve for

194
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:37,118
replications a user settings I'll be
fine through the well-known kickoff

195
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:40,329
the d kickoff

196
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:43,339
works a Ryan

197
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:47,029
not such a complicated way there is a
library

198
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:50,379
a there is a Devon would respond by D
Bus

199
00:12:50,379 --> 00:12:53,689
a it used to be spill make about but
seen squeeze

200
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:57,170
this poem by the bus and the demo axis
is

201
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:00,729
to the stores of settings

202
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:04,420
with garth which are the excimer trees

203
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:08,709
nothing more nothing less and the truth
the store the stacked

204
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:12,109
through the reason on ordering and you
can have reading the store

205
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:15,829
over that read/write store and so you
can have a

206
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:19,738
defaults you look at things and you
can't have another reason the store

207
00:13:19,739 --> 00:13:23,249
on top of that which would be mother
teresa things you cannot

208
00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:26,989
override the settings for

209
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:31,209
pieces only use now by you flip a few
applications

210
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:34,910
a I don't think a in wheezy you

211
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,929
you will need a lot of bugle tuning for
2013 machines

212
00:13:38,929 --> 00:13:42,819
at least you can find any 15 we want to
to

213
00:13:42,819 --> 00:13:47,679
to change now a this

214
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,019
is really did you have specific a the

215
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:54,279
famous are installed in a specific
directory and

216
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:58,160
the default settings are generated from
the famous

217
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,329
in a specific directory the

218
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:04,479
you must are the

219
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:11,360
the description a which settings you are
low Sep this is the command to change

220
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,480
a sitting as a user this is a completely
visiting as a group for all users

221
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,540
should work on all systems and

222
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,980
with again you can change the settings
in a bucket so

223
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,499
a package concert settings for another
package

224
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:31,459
with priorities who is very flexible if
you want to do

225
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:34,868
a local packages for your site so for

226
00:14:34,869 --> 00:14:40,919
the the rigidity distribution and this
is a common

227
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:43,939
the kick off to work minus are

228
00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:47,248
will least you also things the two
concerts

229
00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:50,249
and there is a the will only go for the
tour which

230
00:14:50,249 --> 00:14:53,610
she's a well known for resembling the

231
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:58,209
the Windows registry way being much much
easier

232
00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:04,910
to use regardless starting with Gnome

233
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:08,569
to point to teach you settings will make
with to key settings

234
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:13,009
the it was not finished in to put fifty
two cute because one of the reasons for

235
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:14,299
not using it for

236
00:15:14,299 --> 00:15:17,889
squeeze in room three D's completes

237
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:21,999
a three sittings works entirely
differently

238
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:27,139
a you have the so the the city's I
managed directly by

239
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:30,449
the you I would like to read which

240
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:33,859
we'll manage in itself the schemas

241
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,269
am overwrites so it

242
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:41,279
it doesn't have to you don't have the
but

243
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,529
basically you can already see the
default settings without

244
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:49,329
them and you can

245
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:53,149
but you can plug it by default displayed

246
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:56,799
to the peak of them you can plug it with
cement which stores

247
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:00,559
the settings but you can also even a

248
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,799
as legacy is legal for example some
people prefer other ex the

249
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:07,249
excimer store and apparently it works

250
00:16:07,249 --> 00:16:10,529
wouldn't recommend that there are some
cases

251
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:13,720
where you might want that and Eagle

252
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,990
a this one only has

253
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:20,919
a by the restores and so there is the

254
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:27,309
the system by the restore user 1 it is
the specific formats

255
00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:31,100
the which is good BBBB a

256
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,360
it should be should showing promise that

257
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,410
cute appear in the giau

258
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:43,039
interface soon and the reason for
inventing a former

259
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:46,159
yet and other formats: which looks a bit
like the

260
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:49,399
to cabinet or or libraries like that's

261
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:52,480
East to have type database

262
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,889
exactly like the versace tights so you
can Matt

263
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,949
a any kind of a messaging

264
00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:02,008
including streams arrays

265
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:06,659
arrays of complex data structures in
peace by the restore

266
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:13,339
which other former 2.0 the

267
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:17,250
and the reason for also for binary that
have a sister

268
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:23,839
instead of XML is that because affects
medical was very slow

269
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,970
so for example let's say you want to
change a

270
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:31,490
the somoza be simplified because a

271
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:35,750
will when it is only read only the
library directly access

272
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,190
by the restore with his much faster of
course

273
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:43,850
uni only need dement right

274
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,959
so you can change the setting using
using the GV settings

275
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,700
cover which is what I with them to users
user

276
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:56,289
a you have decal for the talk a min

277
00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:59,850
the don't come complain if it crashes

278
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:04,908
it will crash sometimes but he can be
useful to

279
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:11,909
look in the tree for a given better

280
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,060
just like with would you go if you can't
you mean the the settings in a packet

281
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:23,000
so you can you can she put these things
are right fight in that again directory

282
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,870
depart but we do the rest for you I'm

283
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:29,479
the same holds as with the pic of you
can

284
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,170
you can have stacks settings with
different priorities

285
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:36,200
a

286
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,540
a.m. a few selected examples so hoping
the different backgrounds

287
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,710
the and the aids you can also set

288
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:49,050
a.m. nice transition backgrounds which
would print different picture depending

289
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:49,980
on the time of day

290
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:54,980
the you can bring back for the

291
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:58,890
beacons the the desktop directory on the
desktop

292
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:02,720
from liking squeeze you you

293
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,630
you would have some random trust you can
put on the desktop

294
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:10,790
you can play the team the

295
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:15,820
we've big a drawback which is the key to
key theme

296
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,439
has to be has to exist for you to teach
you want it to be three

297
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,970
because unfortunately both versions use
the same

298
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:29,870
exiting to read a theme so unfortunately
there are maybe two or three teams

299
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:35,709
that would actually work for gnome 3.4
because you still have a pair of

300
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,950
you to get you a pic asians that we look
really

301
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:42,520
bad if you don't you the theme that
works for both

302
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,610
a.m. for example what we use

303
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:50,560
in the cell to to set the default the
the default extensions

304
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,590
the default applications for example we

305
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:57,090
we enable the the alternates

306
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:00,530
the user status menu so that you can

307
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:05,139
shutdown the machine directly from them
said

308
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:12,140
with Oprah senior hidden key amusing de
Golf

309
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,810
it is a bit more complicated than with
legal to set monetary settings

310
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:22,240
a but you can you can basically

311
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,240
by thing a system BB

312
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,970
for you creates another system database

313
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,010
and Indies at a base user defaults

314
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:35,230
just like you would otherwise

315
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:40,090
but it's the key things defaulted decal

316
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:43,889
defaults a so absurd the

317
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:47,290
by former to look exactly the same but
it looks very similar

318
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:51,389
and these defaults

319
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:54,750
will b-max to locks

320
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:58,720
a sorry you set the default

321
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,240
and use it locks together and

322
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,260
when sitting file locks the least

323
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,700
the the settings missed it here we not
beam

324
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,010
modifiable anyway gooey

325
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:15,670
it gives the same results the than what
you have with you go

326
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:20,030
but it's a bit located and forget the
call for dates

327
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:27,030
whenever change the system database so
we're done we use the 13th

328
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,580
a vending

329
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:37,470
in both from really important piece have
the desktop is the login min ago because

330
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,330
this is where

331
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,760
everything starts arm sometimes
everything and see if it doesn't work

332
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:47,240
so how does it work

333
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,330
it is a as you can see it you from call
its

334
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:54,840
the plate of spaghetti because they are
not

335
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,639
of small pieces that talk to each other
and that's

336
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,890
%um scenes version 2.0 twenty-eighth it

337
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:08,160
it works really the same in you give
people in four for you have them

338
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,240
that's thats unknown def

339
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,730
software an the dement with its poem

340
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:19,520
slaves eat one slave for each displayed
when many

341
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,460
so at startup it starts one slave and

342
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:27,100
it's not one slave a the slave into

343
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,070
thief slave process starts x-over

344
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:35,399
them useful and at noon session mind me
mine will no session

345
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,490
run as a big and medium user why

346
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:43,230
white a full session on that list a few
selected processes

347
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:46,480
you ask me because a

348
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,530
what you need is the same as in a full
session you need accessibility

349
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,810
you need to read said to read default
settings

350
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:57,960
well universe emblems basically so you
start to my

351
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,860
my name also from with many many
processes blacklisted anyway

352
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:06,639
and one instead of setting up an alarm

353
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,390
window when it really starts one process
the greeter

354
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:16,410
the greeter or will contain the actual
user interaction

355
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:19,850
it talks with the slave and the slave
talks

356
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:23,919
to Pam a new gonna love you

357
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,520
and once you login everything like that
sq

358
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,480
ever love that is cute and you get your
new

359
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,600
X over on the computer and you can talk

360
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,770
from your system too badly jim DeMint
through but the bus

361
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:43,620
interface which can spawn another slave
on another display

362
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:48,040
because everything is dynamic who when
you close the display

363
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,629
you would be switched to another one

364
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:55,800
consul kits is used everywhere into the
inside that's

365
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,280
because a it is the Demoman which knows

366
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,810
were the the slaves and the displays our
own

367
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:07,620
who is logged on where sodium doesn't
have to be just ordered information

368
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,050
it is go directly from console kits
which is more reliable

369
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:18,050
for that

370
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,180
so the useful things to do with PDMS
configuring it

371
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:24,260
so as you can as you could see

372
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,540
there with the demonym so there are
things you need to configure for the

373
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,050
demonym

374
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:31,360
the they are not lot apps of things

375
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,090
but you will annable yup automatic login
because in this case you don't even want

376
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,070
to run the first

377
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:40,669
a look in session the

378
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:45,540
the little to no configuration you can
enable debugging you can enable

379
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,700
like the MCP although it is very
slippery so

380
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,230
don't do that miss really know what
we're doing

381
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:55,380
don't do that on the interested networks
really

382
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,220
re never a.m.

383
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:04,470
but the reconfiguration is for stuff
that these run inside the

384
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:11,030
them minimal session a the supposed
differs between them to win three

385
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:15,420
because when to use is legal so use it
legal defaults

386
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:20,650
that the united with you could you can
set them in a package this is how we set

387
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:21,450
the

388
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:25,570
to be four bedroom for example the

389
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:29,070
in them three you said you said

390
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:32,139
key settings before in the

391
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:35,520
into the settings from its and you can
also set the

392
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:41,230
other defaults in a package user
defaults

393
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:45,460
the which I i mean language social

394
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,640
and the user i kum the the I can you get
from your

395
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,950
near you and your name the use to peace

396
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:58,300
to be stored in your home directory but

397
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:03,220
the they were be so this there were some
problems with the

398
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:06,220
for example all too much mounting

399
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:10,210
or bankrupted home directories so now it
is thought

400
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:13,680
in the in the system directory which is

401
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,350
managed by the account service the

402
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:20,899
service I did talk about account service
which is

403
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:25,000
another demand tedium users but it's
really a it's both

404
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,280
the internals a PDF almost used to be
part

405
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:35,280
%um actually so once you've logged on

406
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:39,840
a UK you have to manage the user
passwords

407
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,750
the this is what the gloom curing does

408
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:47,560
the book the

409
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:51,060
what these software does is storing
secrets

410
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,659
the use all secrets because it is run
with the use a session

411
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:59,460
ES included fights the

412
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:03,770
will be spies are called hearings a.m.
hearing comes with its own password

413
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:07,420
the there is a demand which alexis is
the key rings

414
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:10,500
and it also does the nifty things like
replacing the

415
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,000
new PV SSH asians with the gnome like

416
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,390
probs and there is the

417
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:21,890
nice special case which is the login
keyring love the look in curing is the

418
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:22,750
specific ewing

419
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,900
which is uses login password so when you
log in

420
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:29,990
you automatically unlock the key ring
but it is on you looked in memory

421
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:34,020
on these use to have safe passwords

422
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,830
so how this works it is the pan with you

423
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:41,720
a which is cool by GDM at the time a
plugin

424
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,040
with you startup a good hearing but

425
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,420
process the it is very the

426
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:52,040
a treatise something like a a 28 from
from

427
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,810
main mean from from would just keep the
bus within memory

428
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:59,800
and when you look into the room session
starts

429
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,139
the demo and it would just get back the

430
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,580
the password early can unlock looking
cuming

431
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,960
when it has to look other hearings if
you set it up

432
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,890
if you set them up you will set them up
by home by default with in using the

433
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:14,600
login keyring

434
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,030
into a new look at another hearing you
would be asked to prompt

435
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:21,500
user applications can use the

436
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,130
these them through the either the

437
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:28,580
lignum hearing library or with a

438
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:32,070
altered disturbed at Secrets the bus
interface

439
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:36,510
this interface is supposed to be
compatible between PE

440
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:40,710
and no all who by had we have

441
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:44,220
noticed be the strange things a you

442
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:48,900
when running the reputations about he by
the other way around seems to work

443
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:55,900
there is also a user interface name
seahorse

444
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,129
too many you're too many your documents

445
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:04,520
the it just presents you with
information it's useful

446
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,580
when you UT I think it's too

447
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,720
the password for something that was like
that

448
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,900
and it will also manage your just new PC
Keith

449
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:19,450
its very light sweet into peaceful
Yuki's

450
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:23,010
and the same time a jury school when you
change a password so it is important for

451
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:23,390
that

452
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:26,940
you change your passwords on the on the
machine

453
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:31,340
using Pam because this will update the
look in curing

454
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,879
a this may look like nothing but when
you have

455
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,930
be network it is often the reef reflex

456
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:41,250
to say okay password management will be
on the server

457
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:44,720
and users will have to use the web
interface or whatever to clean the

458
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,050
passwords

459
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:49,340
you come do that if you want to use the

460
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:56,340
curing

461
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:00,300
okay next is networking a

462
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:04,129
a bit complicated to but extremely
useful

463
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:08,320
gloom entirely relies on this week when
a girl

464
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,800
the so at boot time

465
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,899
the network with a demonstrated

466
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,780
early talks to directly to the terminal
using the looking into faced

467
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:22,730
setup connections a

468
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:25,760
the network whatever them on reads the

469
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,700
you to store of conditions in this
directory

470
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:34,830
these are text by simple picks fights
which is quite connections to start

471
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:38,960
the default behavior or when he doesn't
find anything is to start up

472
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,280
the any interface that is not many by

473
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,810
the something you're for example you
have

474
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:49,190
eth0 confer European if saddam to been

475
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:54,180
not to be taken over but otherwise the
default is who thought you to be under

476
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:58,390
but you can change everything is going
to you able

477
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:02,210
then when the user loads on

478
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:05,470
it was starts a NetworkManager agents

479
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:10,090
ever either nm up let's Ingram 2.3 on
classic

480
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:14,340
or directly notional acts as an agent

481
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,669
be safe and is responsible for

482
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:22,080
the main user interface with his
demeanor you click and you see connect

483
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,629
to these network

484
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:28,400
an also personal problems in the same
way as the key ring

485
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,500
for example the network when I got them
a mighty

486
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:35,520
I need secrets for that connection
prompt the user for the

487
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,260
will be secrets

488
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:42,610
system connections are always thought
you

489
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:47,040
user connections used to be stored in
kickoff and now they are also stored at

490
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,970
the same place

491
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:51,810
Asus as system connections but there was
a permission

492
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:56,050
a minimal missions management system
that up a little so the

493
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:59,050
the commission is marked as owned by
User

494
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:02,760
true instead of being for everyone

495
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,540
and only DRO can right condition for use
with Drew

496
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:12,190
what you need root permissions to right
conditions for everyone

497
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:16,580
and the important thing is also that the
agent talks to the key ring them

498
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:21,250
to stall the secrets securely

499
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:24,530
so this is the Commission's I started at
boot time an

500
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:27,580
you can't control them only to have
appropriate

501
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:31,490
policy get permissions when you can
pre-configured them

502
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:35,690
which is extremely useful for into
prices

503
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:38,960
set-ups user connections

504
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,020
well you can give or not the the ability

505
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:46,260
for the user to start connections a the
default

506
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:51,410
East who will that anti-sway secrets our
store

507
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:54,620
for use a connection stick with us
during the curing

508
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:58,620
but a of course the the the connection
between

509
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,909
becomes attacked to the use or so if you
switch

510
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:06,180
to another user the connection we
automatically dropped

511
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:10,960
some people see these are the future a
some people see these are the bag

512
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,140
and it was a it was solved the

513
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:17,260
very recently in the beyond by the

514
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:22,750
making the the behavior depends on your
permissions

515
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,180
so if you are a member of those who do
group

516
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,180
or the network

517
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:33,340
net for but def group

518
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:37,929
you have permissions to edit system
connections without password

519
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:43,490
and the agent detects thats and we try
to create system connections by default

520
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:47,020
which will be shared between all users

521
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:50,370
but if you don't have this permission
instead if we create use our connection

522
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:50,790
would be

523
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:54,670
which would not be shared

524
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:58,880
a.m. there are some complicated set ups
like system connections but

525
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,190
with the user secrets a NBC's most
useful for the peons

526
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:07,170
and for the the a to chew doing

527
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,320
one X a

528
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,730
with a vacation mutant repeated the

529
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:17,500
route wpa2 enterprise or authenticated

530
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:22,610
if in its

531
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:26,030
so configuration can look like that

532
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:29,720
let's say you have a very very stupid
problem

533
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:33,219
a on only very very bad

534
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:37,459
company could have such a problem say
let's say your DHCP server returns

535
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:42,199
a information that is on ebuddy for
Windows machines

536
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:45,659
butts you want to play Linux machines
and

537
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:49,020
so all no problem I will override that
used to be settings

538
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,649
yes that's you will also need to connect
these machines

539
00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:55,668
on outside networks where

540
00:34:55,668 --> 00:34:59,180
well the DHCP server we would term

541
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:03,200
information you need so you can set up

542
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,250
to system connections and external
connections

543
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:10,230
with his some kind of a default a

544
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:13,350
so you define an Ethernet connection a

545
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:16,839
which use you to be me for is 02

546
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,090
an you have to specify the mac address
is to

547
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:23,250
say that we don't fight the device of
course is

548
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:27,030
peace you can get caught when you enable

549
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:30,380
ipv6 but use use

550
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:35,150
set up another comment from with the
same mac Address

551
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:38,530
and this one is a

552
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:41,970
you overwrite everything from that used
to be subtle so you return a difference

553
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:47,290
DNS different the research suffixes

554
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:51,200
and the user will be film a with the two

555
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:56,740
you you're so beautiful ipv6 because
usually when you have such a bad set up

556
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,990
it won't work at the user will be
presented with both

557
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:03,200
corrections arm will be able to switch
from one

558
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,049
to another in one click it is a of
course to see

559
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:10,070
a simple example for very bad case

560
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:13,300
but israel unfortunately the

561
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:17,960
or the use cases you can present for
your pre-shared key for the wifi without

562
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,190
the user knowing the the key

563
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:24,550
just not very useful anyway but the

564
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:28,370
it is more useful than giving the shift
key to the user's

565
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:33,660
is we didn't have to remember it a but
you can also do a 2-2 that when X

566
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,910
a either with with the machine
certificates so

567
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:39,950
this will you deploy to certificates on
the machine but the user doesn't

568
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:43,189
use it Kate but you can also give the
user certificates

569
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:47,500
in which case you can for your a a 2.1 X

570
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,060
and the user can select the connection
it is because your

571
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:55,730
but he would be asked for his personal
credentials

572
00:36:55,730 --> 00:37:00,230
all love that's wasting Halloween users
to create all the connections like wifi

573
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:03,240
to roaming et cetera so it's

574
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,259
very flexible and if you

575
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:10,110
eat some love you were at the this
morning's talk about it with whatever

576
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:13,410
there I think a lot of features a like

577
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:17,200
the bonding support InfiniBand which
will

578
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:24,200
make all about very revoked also on
service

579
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:34,830
yeah yeah

580
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:39,880
permission for important

581
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:45,490
a.m.

582
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:48,660
related to networking is the VFS layer

583
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:52,348
a from so with his name

584
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:56,220
DVFS no the

585
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:59,919
this one works with also with the key I
Ribery

586
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,280
he spotted you live and the key I all
over the excesses

587
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:09,099
the PDF is their mom youth spoon when
needed so let's say

588
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:12,240
a you are accessing only five a

589
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:17,879
you are both so not no need to look to
them an attorney you ask for something

590
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,300
else

591
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:23,410
well the the TV offers them on would do
a lot of things

592
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:27,368
possible it will the Spohn

593
00:38:27,369 --> 00:38:30,990
on explicit request this is a huge
difference with

594
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:34,098
e summer you knew order from the

595
00:38:34,099 --> 00:38:37,560
into mounting is explicit so

596
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,220
you ask for example amounts for these

597
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:45,299
SMB server and it was dark specific
process

598
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:49,190
to talk to the server you going to you
can start as many

599
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:53,200
PDF is the process as you need got
started

600
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:58,240
and as upon request and the same them in
talks to

601
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,330
the leap you film this cutie to the
library

602
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:04,490
which talks to you the sperm

603
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:08,098
a new disc is the system them on
responsible for mounting

604
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:11,650
system devices to let's say you played

605
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,920
a USB device is a a very a

606
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,500
a period you useful keys to see

607
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:22,920
you def notices the device says to you
these

608
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,060
other you have a device the beast
notifies

609
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:31,730
league did you a.m. one of the
applications using its

610
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:35,320
is the new rochelle on them sitting
dement

611
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,750
which has a policy of mounting USB
devices

612
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:42,160
when there are blood so 0 mount its

613
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,299
police a guitar do you have the right
amount this

614
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:51,190
yes you have the rights mount and after
being mounted of course you get a signal

615
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:51,540
that

616
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:54,900
that's been mounted a.m.

617
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:58,530
to other interesting things a you have a
fuse interface

618
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:02,190
for applications that don't understand
the but don't you sleep

619
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:05,480
giao so it appears in the in

620
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:09,480
the got his GFS with but leave the
office

621
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,800
directory and notice

622
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,890
knows how to how to tell apart
applications with do

623
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:20,730
which do know how to exit are those who
don't

624
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:23,950
for example a benefice doesn't have the

625
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:27,419
you support so notice was started in

626
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:31,450
the by giving it the path to the file in
this directory

627
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:34,569
and it is it would still transparently
access the

628
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:39,910
the remote fights Libra piece anyway the
used Kia you now so it is

629
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:45,520
not we don't anymore an example term

630
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:50,670
with the forgets yes how to how to mount
command

631
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:53,780
from the command line all love that can
be done from the command line

632
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:58,070
and

633
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:01,550
the last part is the palimpsest a

634
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:05,660
user interface which expose all the
internal

635
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:09,808
functions so this is for example what
happens when you have a

636
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:13,779
when you look at the the partitions and
you can control

637
00:41:13,779 --> 00:41:18,849
a almost everything a on these
corporations going to them

638
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:22,720
your to mounting from a team encryption
whatever

639
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:29,720
a tons features an

640
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:33,730
last but not least a missing the noose

641
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:39,440
stuff that's you might want to know if
you have trouble to begin your

642
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,799
system or deleting permissions or
whatever

643
00:41:42,799 --> 00:41:46,180
so applications for you

644
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:49,288
used the XTP mmm mine system

645
00:41:49,289 --> 00:41:52,839
use of applications on the user

646
00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:56,140
counterparts this includes

647
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:59,319
positions that appear in the menus and
applications

648
00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:04,558
that can be associated with the mime
type: this is how you at

649
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:08,410
a assume a submenu in your you main menu

650
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:12,529
where you can say beef application
categories will go there

651
00:42:12,529 --> 00:42:16,230
cups

652
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:21,079
a for printing you have a a

653
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:24,430
up little legal stuff which is the

654
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:29,069
cups because keep helper which
complements cups

655
00:42:29,069 --> 00:42:32,359
the because as you know cups is a bit
rough the

656
00:42:32,359 --> 00:42:37,369
to use directly because you have to go
to web interface the biggest hit helper

657
00:42:37,369 --> 00:42:42,509
lost control cups through the bus he
doesn't do all the operations you can do

658
00:42:42,509 --> 00:42:43,589
on the web interface

659
00:42:43,589 --> 00:42:47,150
but it does already a lot you because
you can confer European tourists or

660
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:50,460
start them stop them print whatever

661
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:53,589
so

662
00:42:53,589 --> 00:42:57,470
a on it is accessed through the
configuration interface

663
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:01,129
which season squeeze persistent conflict
printer or in wheezy

664
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:04,170
the no cultural center and from

665
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:07,380
the the notification the applets

666
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:11,910
that will tell you something is printing
be bringing messages or 2.0

667
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:18,259
as little no more people there is a poor
management interface

668
00:43:18,259 --> 00:43:22,749
you power which is excess directly by
the city's them

669
00:43:22,749 --> 00:43:28,200
the to play the policy the

670
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:32,348
Council room disposal you'll a which we

671
00:43:32,349 --> 00:43:35,759
intentionally excluded from squeeze
because we felt it was not

672
00:43:35,759 --> 00:43:40,630
ready given the state of some rivals but
which is here by default in wheezy

673
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:43,920
so bad if a

674
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,670
by default or mixing interfaces so this
includes

675
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:50,839
what happens when you press the

676
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:54,410
this that maybe those that is

677
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:57,848
this interface a is now done through

678
00:43:57,849 --> 00:44:04,200
a both with you only so if you want to
these herbal both with you

679
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,720
a you you have to

680
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,430
so you're you also have to remind that

681
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:15,598
mixing will not work regardless

682
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:21,039
it's not of a problem who if you do that
but people who is now ready are required

683
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:21,690
for mixing

684
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:26,109
the an interesting setting can be too

685
00:44:26,109 --> 00:44:29,150
if you have really %um multiple use a
machine you can

686
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:32,660
good for you prosecute to mute the sound
whenever switching users

687
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:35,680
so with

688
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:40,160
the is what when you switch users on
doesn't play anymore and you come back

689
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:47,160
it plays is it resumes be okay

690
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:51,058
a mmm finals finer things I'm almost
finished

691
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:55,150
the scripting the home a

692
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:58,390
which is also something you want to do
when you are when you have a lot of

693
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:00,180
users who was who often have

694
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:04,348
a spent by specific stuff it is very
easy to integrate

695
00:45:04,349 --> 00:45:08,400
your stuffing gnome you can scripting by
phone

696
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,239
you can skip no script a

697
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:16,499
free why would you want to do that we're
them you we have

698
00:45:16,499 --> 00:45:19,689
the real example here a.m.

699
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:22,940
enterprise proxy which only works with
Internet Explorer

700
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:27,160
the a bite from cold that bypasses its

701
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:31,519
and requires the use of a password the
bus were is stored in a computer in

702
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,410
through these on the ice

703
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:36,269
month so this is where you would want to
interface with them curing

704
00:45:36,269 --> 00:45:39,299
and with GTK in with two starting

705
00:45:39,299 --> 00:45:42,819
a.m. you you might have

706
00:45:42,819 --> 00:45:46,980
the you might want fear better with
Windows servers

707
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,989
so you want your to store

708
00:45:49,989 --> 00:45:53,190
a to look for the the

709
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:57,410
correct path in the Active Directory and
ask the user for his password

710
00:45:57,410 --> 00:46:00,719
for research and you the same password
for kissing

711
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:05,119
the the fights petite to try to

712
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:09,579
so or look at them hearing is the thing
we interface with the

713
00:46:09,579 --> 00:46:12,690
the most on our setups

714
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:16,059
because the it makes it really easy to
manage

715
00:46:16,059 --> 00:46:19,289
all the passwords you have the you know
in a complex

716
00:46:19,289 --> 00:46:23,839
by sitting

717
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:28,489
but all love that's is nothing compare
to the work you have to do for

718
00:46:28,489 --> 00:46:30,940
a be infrastructural

719
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:35,109
the configuring one this top you put all
these all the fittings are told you

720
00:46:35,109 --> 00:46:38,520
you're missing works fine now you want
to have a thousand

721
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,220
15th this is different you needed
infrastructure

722
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:47,520
who this is just a checklists because it
always depends on the

723
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,009
much you have what you won't the

724
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:54,319
there was a very nice talk by the way
yesterday about free IP a

725
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:59,319
the used good example of what's an
infrastructure can look like

726
00:46:59,319 --> 00:47:02,569
so you might want

727
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:06,349
a demure or from the custom repository

728
00:47:06,349 --> 00:47:11,010
to have specific packages a custom
installation CD

729
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:15,000
using one of the two available solutions
medium FBI or

730
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,099
begins tomorrow Union Station

731
00:47:18,099 --> 00:47:22,310
printing printing is re doesn't look

732
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:26,940
like should still be a problem printing
is what would cause you the most trouble

733
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:27,550
if you want

734
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:32,160
to to enable its from Linux machines
a.m.

735
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,509
why is that a.m.

736
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:39,619
you can have you have a cup server

737
00:47:39,619 --> 00:47:43,339
with hundreds of Pringles even 1000 the
printers now

738
00:47:43,339 --> 00:47:46,430
and if you if you do that

739
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:49,598
the user interface will present you or

740
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:53,859
other printers and you you you don't
have easy ways to feel to them out

741
00:47:53,859 --> 00:47:57,440
the work through

742
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,890
there is no easy solutions that some
people puts

743
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:04,029
a lot of principles so you have one
principle for

744
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:07,130
eat building but it's expensive so you

745
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:10,910
you put them into two machines but you
have in terms of the two machines with

746
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:14,009
on the 10 printers a

747
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:17,369
if the investor who used to work for us

748
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:21,750
find a good solution but the each week
with berksten cups

749
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:25,470
baking cups well you can but you will
never

750
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:28,868
have you back accepted by the upstream
because upstream supple

751
00:48:28,869 --> 00:48:33,410
Apple requires copyright the sitting
room so

752
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,839
thank you up for keeping cups

753
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:40,349
non-working a.m.

754
00:48:40,349 --> 00:48:43,650
every time you use the network

755
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:48,190
never forgets a this was stressed by
many other speakers never forget about

756
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:50,720
time synchronization time
synchronization

757
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,230
the out of sync machines will behave

758
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:58,740
erratically and many many ways network
by systems

759
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:02,598
authentication the even printing

760
00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:06,660
the everything with fayed you'll have
been to be a.m.

761
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:10,490
and you win the most of the time because

762
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:14,490
none of the solution is complete she
will name a need a solution to

763
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:17,520
to confer your stuff directly arm new
machines

764
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,609
so that means pets because Pictu or

765
00:49:20,609 --> 00:49:24,000
other imaging solution night salts a

766
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,540
it's very very very vibrant community a
currently

767
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:32,819
you will need that's traveler machines
and

768
00:49:32,819 --> 00:49:36,440
to to think that I'm not not humble

769
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:41,700
at all but any who I've looked at root
password generation

770
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:46,060
because you you don't want to put the
same with possible machines right

771
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:51,230
and information systems don't deal with
that oh yes yes

772
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:54,230
you can set up a root password by
default

773
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:57,310
and heavy transmitted the in clear over
the network

774
00:49:57,310 --> 00:50:01,230
it up so you know have any solution for
with better management

775
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:04,910
and the same holds for encryption keys
if you decide to

776
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:08,609
use a a DM creeps to

777
00:50:08,609 --> 00:50:13,200
to encrypt your partitions on laptops
the same holds you don't have

778
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,390
an easy way to generate a key and then

779
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:20,578
make the user and threat the password
for the ski

780
00:50:20,579 --> 00:50:25,140
et cetera

781
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:27,180
and that is all thank you for listening

782
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:31,019
any questions

783
00:50:31,019 --> 00:50:38,019
yes

784
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:43,259
yeah yes certainly a

785
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:50,260
be there already uploaded a I will
