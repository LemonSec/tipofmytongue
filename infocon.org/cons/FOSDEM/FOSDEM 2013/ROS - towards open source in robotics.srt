1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,299
sick a fantastic thank you for the
introduction my name is Morgan quickly

2
00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:07,419
I'm with the open source for what
explanation this could be about

3
00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:11,269
in a brief overview of growth and will
dive into some technical details

4
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:15,000
andy san dimas along the way and maybe
watching a movie or two

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,740
so a this talk is about ross and friends

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,830
were from the open source about
explanation so

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,839
what we do we support the development
distribution and adoption open source

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,650
software for use in robotics research

9
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,240
education product development that's
very broad and we can fit

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,610
a whole lot of things in there that's
our website or star condition

11
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,149
we have a little building their non View
Calif than

12
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:42,670
in Silicon Valley okay so the big
picture here

13
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,469
a what we're hoping to recreate and open
to to help occur

14
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:49,719
is the creation is something like a LAMP
stack for

15
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,370
for robotics so lamps not consider many
people here in this room who have made

16
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,500
critical contributions to it a minutes
Apache my sequel

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,399
Python Perl PHP and something on this
gripping with severe

18
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,689
choice can produce dot com protect no
and so if you have an idea for a green

19
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:07,350
dot com

20
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,689
you can go down on them stacked I'm you
know code for a bit

21
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:14,029
and then before too long you gonna have
a prototype up and running for not that

22
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:14,650
much cost

23
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:19,570
in time it's to the point now where that
is to say anything you can go on any

24
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:22,020
number of calm providers government
documents

25
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,140
get it up and running on a on a virtual
machine somewhere really quickly

26
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,650
and the robotics industry there's the
historically hasn't been

27
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,729
at serve an analog for that what you
wanted to get a new business or any

28
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:32,970
application up and running

29
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,140
it was a lotta I'm through pain and
suffering getting this

30
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,200
pieces to work together so what we're
trying to do is to push

31
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,070
Ubuntu subsystems here components and
can include them adopted them all

32
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,419
together with ross to

33
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,880
ultimate protectors and in

34
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,089
entrepreneurs who ever wants to has an
interesting idea for a large company

35
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,750
able to get the prototypes up and
running quickly and then move it to

36
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,439
to development and production so these
are some other open source projects that

37
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,508
were working with them

38
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,119
we're helping to combine into a unified
system i'm talking about them

39
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,940
interview so let's step back a bit and
look at why robotics up to his heart

40
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:14,819
and that's why is this difficult to do
today the you can look at

41
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:18,349
the percentage that thing there's this
little cartoon when I was a

42
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:21,579
at Stanford with the coldest that that's
a stapler problem and the server inside

43
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,290
joke you

44
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,179
if you have some really simple tasks
like if you want to tell her about to

45
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:25,660
please

46
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,319
go get me a stapler from my office if
you can break down the

47
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:33,250
some tax that ask there's a don't think
Monaco you have to write and subsystems

48
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,480
that the voting in a great

49
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,069
separatist certain that the ride on that
top row we have

50
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:41,290
court or navigation see the drive down
always the Finder

51
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,650
replaced you to open doors in there
about opening

52
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,830
my all that the store their a.m. in
ninety-two

53
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:51,260
transferred between force there's a
robot in front of the elevator

54
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,640
do not personally just gonna walls to
confirm that we're the call buttons to

55
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,480
push that the company will be there

56
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,268
and once you get to the actual desk or
table where there might be a step really

57
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:02,989
needs this or a park there and and look
all around with cameras

58
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:06,200
there the religion identify staple
removers from

59
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,480
at the Brea my old desk and the family
to pick up this paper we have to repeat

60
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,518
them walking backwards

61
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,790
to go back and deliver the stapler say
that something silly like please getting

62
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,569
ever this goodness taper my office if
you break that down it's an incredible

63
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:20,700
mix of persons that have to work
together

64
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,149
on there about so for it to those little
boxes there there's the whole team

65
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,580
take so that just the computer vision
component extend to the second time

66
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,370
so with people working on and I love as
Stanford I'm

67
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,159
that lab at Stanford is one not too many
universities across the world working on

68
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,540
many some systems and robotics

69
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,650
so that gets again most played out next
year the pyramid

70
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,790
and then finally what we want to have
for the systems that are usable so that

71
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,489
you can

72
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:47,909
take a system that works and wonder
about you know if you then go to the

73
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:48,920
Senate the world

74
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,439
totally different about make that some
system work again

75
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:56,439
so the other is just the thing about
robotics is that needs to be fasting is

76
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:57,950
to be deductible because we have

77
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:01,399
these huge teams working on these
problems that said about the core the

78
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,640
difficult problems in robotics

79
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,230
involve uncertainty which means serve
everyone in the room but you're gonna

80
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,670
see a different

81
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,429
a lot of the different me to
calculations and so being able to record

82
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,459
these and pay them back

83
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,340
and have real datasets is is critical so
another interesting thing

84
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,579
a box of cereal sometimes it turns into
a distributed systems problem

85
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:22,509
so this is when this thereabouts be at a
Stanford for many years

86
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:27,020
it's sort of the prototypical bigtit
battleship robot birth

87
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,198
it's a mobile bay some bottom once a big
batteries

88
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:33,520
insulators planning everywhere it had
three on-board computers

89
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,340
a.m. manipulator arm was further sensors
then I would typically walk behind it

90
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,099
with a laptop

91
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,070
and then there be rock observers in the
basement that is talking to streaming

92
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,930
data to and from

93
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:47,090
so namely the to keep early problems
been neither distributed systems aspects

94
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:47,659
as well

95
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,830
so is a tricky problems a little bit
back story for us

96
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:55,770
so I had these things I was a TA at one
time a verbal responses Stanford we have

97
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,549
not so different student groups coming
together

98
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,229
for problems like that but just a
problem we wanted

99
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:05,599
level ever into devote devote their
systems and

100
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,610
in or small groups and then periodically
other systems cannot come together with

101
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,750
you this big demonstrations

102
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,539
and so as to support that I go to a few
prototypes there

103
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:18,820
one of the most girls with short lived
for maybe a year so Behringer key to

104
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,009
many you may know and was on the players
stage here and that for a long time

105
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:27,240
Eric Berger was also my classmates at
Stanford minute once they will occur as

106
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,830
in can come it will look gross

107
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,080
will have a home in Civ different
experiences in products we previously

108
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,490
ran we can determine the blender for a
couple years

109
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:39,009
and out came the star Ross architecture
with all the striker

110
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:42,610
they have been a person's since those
contributions many conclusions that many

111
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,570
dozens of other people to the court for
us

112
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,169
and then many hundreds and thousands of
contributors to two packages the sorts

113
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:50,340
around Austin

114
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,099
so it's helpful to first pressed to find
what ross is not

115
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,150
it is not a real OS and I say that on
purpose because I know

116
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:01,049
many people in this rumor deeply
involved in the next up in a system

117
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,710
internals so it's not an OS it's not
running actually on the

118
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,948
you know the bare-bones the computer
it's a one level up from there so it's

119
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:09,410
an obstruction there that sits above

120
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:13,350
real operating systems and then tie them
together on on the network

121
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,840
it's not monolithic this there's not a
big ID I'm

122
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,960
instead it's a whole bunch of small
tools they get tied together

123
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,138
and up in time to see people work
minerals to have you know twenty term is

124
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:23,520
open

125
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,568
remember seeing and is not tied to any
particular about that

126
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:29,810
there but there's the weather grows
appear to which

127
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,050
many people are promising videos that
robot with a gross given many them out

128
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,530
that's about it across the world and so
there's been times the dress code

129
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,210
written for

130
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:41,219
but there are also many other many many
other platforms using

131
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,580
roster and thought would be more about
them

132
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,409
coming up so know what Ross actually is

133
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,880
it is a weak and divided into four main
topics to discuss her

134
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:57,169
the purses it's a sort of plumbing so
message passing their

135
00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:00,859
it's a set of tools so small tools you
can use them and give them a

136
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,270
command-line tools deliver

137
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,469
a graphical tools it's been a collection
of capabilities

138
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:09,759
sanitiser big subsystems that promotes a
present for navigation system

139
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,250
and image processing system and speech
spoken dialogue systems

140
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,120
there's a whole bunch with each of those
things their multiple used

141
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,180
computer vision systems you can go
download from various other

142
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,590
of the world and it's only an ecosystem
with many people contributing to this

143
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:29,818
a minute at least these four things here
in a little more detail

144
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:33,270
so first a talking about the from the
plumbing and said ross

145
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:36,680
the paradigm is mostly anonymous
publish/subscribe

146
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,789
that's used in in many systems across
the world I'm so many people in this

147
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:40,719
room that these that

148
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,039
sometimes the terms are different than
on the nerves are different but

149
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:48,289
per did you hear that you have a pencil
consumers and producers at their

150
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:52,020
they can exist anywhere on the network
11 producer bitter

151
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,250
cause a public function and that message
get sterilized

152
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,610
blasted out anybody else who subscribe
to him there's

153
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,669
a master know that sits on top the
distorted keep track a little thing

154
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:05,568
functions much like DNS over the
Internet were publishers can

155
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:09,240
advertised with them that master
maintains data structures which

156
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,810
people is to this person the subscribers
and sign up for

157
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:18,220
data topics: don't listen to and they
receive back to mister their peers and

158
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,310
all the connections accident occurred
appear

159
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:25,280
so the heavy data flows high-traffic
things I'll prepare

160
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,508
I'm its skills so lets the

161
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:31,660
the main point we're doing here is we're
connecting data streams not actual

162
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,909
program so in honor of bergamot your
writing

163
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:37,880
you would say that I want to subscribe
to images you know this early right

164
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,610
I don't want I want to subject to
cameras there or camera wunderkammer to

165
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,170
is the ice porn image 1 and it's up to
the system to figure out

166
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,430
who's actually producing image 1 it
tells you where to connect to that and

167
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,399
the knowledge that happens in real time

168
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,800
so the pier tour about when it starts at
the perks of 56

169
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,790
growth processes which then interns on
all 538 topics me the kind of peer to

170
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,610
peer connections that happened

171
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,769
this picture was actually the the sort
of it's a stapler or canonical

172
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:07,790
challenge problem there's the Ross

173
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:11,529
data flow diagram and then the main
thing here is that any time

174
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:14,920
that's the dynamic structures not a
stunning graphics so you can run your

175
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,630
program start maternal transfer programs

176
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:21,610
I'm them now these little green notes on
their parade will start

177
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:25,209
and then they would that connect to the
system at any time any those

178
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:29,729
its its bubble their notice that is
yours process anytime they can go down

179
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,769
their link that appears obviously
disappear but then you can relax then

180
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:33,640
restart them

181
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,779
and they connect appears again
everything concerning

182
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:39,730
the they're given that is up in times
when you were gonna be complicated or

183
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:40,170
one

184
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:44,069
it YouTube apparently bucking the system
listed building one little bit

185
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:47,690
so imagine that you're trying to work on
the image processing agreements vision

186
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,459
a premier you don't necessarily have to
restart the whole

187
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:55,349
arm controllers are the navigation
system every time you want to change

188
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,610
women according to a computer vision
system so you can do as you can

189
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,019
have this whole system up so they say
have 50 or 100 processes running on

190
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,180
there abouts

191
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,849
multiple computers on the network if
something's going here where you can

192
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,250
collapse in the process

193
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,760
change wanna go to the compiler and
again inject itself back into it the

194
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,930
running system and all the pure

195
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,239
connections come up so

196
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,350
that actual messages that are flowing we
have our own

197
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,700
interface description language we tried
to keep it simple the left line

198
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,620
there so this this is the actual code at
their office joystick message so

199
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,820
if you have a joystick motor controller
about I'm

200
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,550
this is going to work flows across the
the network so there's a header or this

201
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,449
is just basically a timestamp

202
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:39,579
and then there's a vector just got
seasoned veterans

203
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:42,640
that's just three months ago does this
thats with total the joystick message

204
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,560
across

205
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,268
then you when it I make it then blasts
out

206
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:50,560
line with specific implementations that
all the languages that are including

207
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,420
loss of your system had this bad
language is installed it would

208
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,880
under 2009 zip code did terrible

209
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,850
terrible code that we should never right
it's just mind to make that step to do

210
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,660
all those men copies and things and an
exit

211
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,140
from their systems are with all done
before

212
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,279
ok it's another that's been little
talking about the slides a system demos

213
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,470
and have some work seven here

214
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:17,839
so

215
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,490
okay so the first thing we start general
system is called raw score

216
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:26,550
actually used to be called by her in
them a large defense contractor

217
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,479
growth knows that you know ross is fun
but please don't call about her

218
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,829
are security people don't like seeing
things about her during our networks

219
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:37,219
sending and receiving data to random
sucks you

220
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,029
so that's the overall score that sits in
the back as the master programs running

221
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:43,769
on topic that like the enhanced

222
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:47,220
so that's going to set their normal time
we can then

223
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,320
months little program called talker
which stalker does nothing other than

224
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,500
tent and the second creates a string
with hello world purse

225
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:59,089
an integer and that send governor the
doctor to sit in there working hard

226
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:02,560
a.m. there are lots of tools are also
known that's kinda fun is called arts

227
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,670
craft

228
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,490
what this does is it connects to the
master node and this is what's happening

229
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,950
on the system

230
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,990
you can see the that's what's happening
is number expanding it is the talker

231
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,889
notice in there no one's listening to
him

232
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:17,579
so let's get a new cell

233
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:21,099
and was a listener marks an

234
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,279
status tempers a all it's doing is it's
listening to it that a topic name

235
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,579
chatter and then it is bringing out
whatever comes across chatter

236
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:34,069
so this is saying heard this message
thank you

237
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,639
so it's fun but that the poor the system
is this whole thing is the nemitz with

238
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:38,120
the peeps

239
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,050
would be conducting 10 then the system
so the Citizen think I'll topper to

240
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:46,339
which is doing the same thing as the
talker and we can see knows we inject a

241
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:47,660
min will see it popped up

242
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,860
it's connected in their arsenal the data
topic chatter in broadcasted by two nos

243
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,399
that listener began no keeping this is
confirmed

244
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,430
let's make another listener no so no got
a little more complicated

245
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,630
there now those two guys broadcasting
chatter

246
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:06,000
there's two listeners you can see that
their posts on your little squirrely

247
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,149
and within a period there are two
sequences and numbers now

248
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:12,620
that are flying that we started those
occurs at different times

249
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,529
so the more commitment with the graphics
on this phone but of course they know

250
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:18,180
what it was like to be on the command
and all the time so we can't that

251
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:22,888
in topic income growth topics things
they're off topic list

252
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:26,110
and this gives us three things is
brought into are

253
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,899
rough equivalent of standard out for a
distributed system so every

254
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:34,190
Ross noted can broadcasters on the cover
of something you can have one terminal

255
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,889
the clocks can only up it's a at the
system that work

256
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:41,399
but emerges in there is chatter weakens
their last message

257
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,250
show her group Ross

258
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,389
in chatter this will interrogate the
system and say what is this thing called

259
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:52,940
other what's happening it says its them

260
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,769
the datatype there's still a message
string there are two guys putting it

261
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,720
together subscribing to our

262
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,279
so nothing we can do now israel's topic
a coach other

263
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,699
and now this is going to broadcast
everything coming across that chatter

264
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:07,529
topic you can see them here the
parliament injected a new one so that

265
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:08,660
girl

266
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:13,639
off topic and then over to numbers is to
make sure it's me

267
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:18,829
we Cisco the the basis that the plumbing
we've tried hard to make this simple

268
00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:23,010
it's not the world's fastest enormous
purposes guide implementation

269
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:27,110
any means but we have tried to make it
so it is simple to do

270
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:31,730
so that see look at the minimal code
here this is the super sports person

271
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,160
with the courses

272
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,889
says the more for both and natural
images like like button

273
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:39,959
but they do here's really you just bring
in the Ross

274
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:43,510
no up declaring that you're gonna
published data

275
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:47,029
I'm doing it contains a second just that
there's been asleep

276
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:50,000
the other thing to note here is that
we're not trying to take over your main

277
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,519
function

278
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:53,720
there's still a main function you're
still in control the sleep you can do

279
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,019
other things such as urine

280
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,430
graphical interface update sir any other
things you need to do

281
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,510
in general there Ross philosophy is to
try not to take over your program

282
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,480
execution

283
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,329
we try to make it so that you can grab
your interface to the Ross

284
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:09,500
on on top of an existing system so

285
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,740
we're not sinister to take over the
softer world where this making this

286
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,740
this seems easy to write so you can take
an existing basic functionality

287
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:23,070
and then read a little humor on it and
brings it into our system

288
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:26,889
because these guys are just to listen to
their hearts content here

289
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:30,779
stop them

290
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:34,339
ok it's easy as I was turning down our
dates back to the single talker which is

291
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:35,120
kinda

292
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,440
lonely and it's going to be even more
lonely

293
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,630
resistant the sediments at the school

294
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:47,040
okay so back to be more sites that's
good overview the plumbing system

295
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,810
it's never experienced this move on a
the tools that now is where things get

296
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:51,689
interesting

297
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:55,279
so we have a.m. all these different
messages that we have

298
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,600
in the system there thousands of them
out there sister to the most useful once

299
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,990
the laser scan

300
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:04,440
is a common thing about text you see it
this occurs spinning laser

301
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,370
it's been drawn to the in a plane and
tells you they're great distance to

302
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:11,620
very subject to the laser is returning
to that to the world so

303
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:15,130
open kind ever you repeat the same
there's a thing on the top that spins

304
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:15,870
around

305
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,500
and up at to be a custom binder message
so

306
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,970
this is a picture of seven laser
rangefinders there they all have their

307
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,209
own custom banner protocol

308
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:29,000
the nice but those that know everything
has been bridge to ross

309
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,389
so all these things up at least
investors to be turning on your startup

310
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:33,019
roster

311
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:37,500
later driver you're gonna have I'm
latest images coming out which is

312
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,250
is general enough to build a defined
approval the Scourge

313
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:46,389
similarly for the robust on their those
R who was the trip was in a battle worth

314
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:48,380
different vendors we just heard from on
brown

315
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,570
want to stick in the mail one second
never look

316
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:54,579
I'm they have pretty much an era but
will up

317
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:57,758
put some sort of representation with
state which sinn for the

318
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,920
in robotics terminology that oftentimes
means a vector

319
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,168
numbers where one element vector group

320
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:08,620
angle a bit robots if then they're here
talk with the now 25 degrees of freedom

321
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:12,448
and I was able to publish the joint
state message which has instructor point

322
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:13,760
numbers and

323
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,209
and so everywhere but now that is if
it's Ross broadcast this incoming

324
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:17,679
message

325
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,350
which the exciting part is now you can
right tools which operate one level up

326
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:24,740
and that are abstracted across robots
seeking up

327
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,770
know it tools for laser scanning in a
visualization or

328
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:31,750
not building or what have you or about
configuration tools that are

329
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,120
that our general across robots across
the north and that repeats for many

330
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:42,080
other aspects everybody especially in

331
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,820
some other tools are very useful the
system visualizer oh so in the dark

332
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,870
scrapped or

333
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:50,149
o'clock some other tools planning tools
you can take any number

334
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:54,100
and send it to these plotting things
which was great workbooks replica so

335
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,330
scope

336
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:58,620
time series about a different picture

337
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,799
there are several simulators which have
been bridge to ross also some examples

338
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:02,910
with gazebo

339
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:06,370
at the end but there are other ones also
I'm

340
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:10,000
then diagnostic systems were since thats
creates a go in there

341
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,200
or something that's easier to put making

342
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,270
dust-up type notification tools
processing

343
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:21,200
other one is happier in order with the
time series is that these failures

344
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,360
is also a lot of tools for collecting
log files

345
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,600
so one the town's the robotics is that
it works great

346
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,559
in your lab me go to do in order to work
from a perfect all the time

347
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:34,549
and up sometimes even want to you know
after that them with over and maybe

348
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:37,389
surrounding me didn't you want to then
see like what on earth happened the

349
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,360
system what to do

350
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,740
your phone spacer when the about what
their

351
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,840
so what we doing there is you can take
the whole system

352
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,230
you can just there's a program called
ross back the dinner idea there this is

353
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,830
a joint bank in all the messages
confined to it

354
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,309
collectively called back file to the
gigantic files bonuses that were

355
00:18:54,309 --> 00:18:55,809
broadcast network

356
00:18:55,809 --> 00:18:59,340
then you can play them back so you can
since they don't that missus bank upside

357
00:18:59,340 --> 00:18:59,659
down

358
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,820
shake at the right for good seats on the
sister beloved

359
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,330
and there if the system has no idea what
just happened so

360
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,710
anything downstream at the actual
producers are those messages

361
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:12,799
it it doesn't change anything just looks
like the same

362
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,240
system what's happening that doesn't
realize that it's the sincere time work

363
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,940
to you last week or whenever

364
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,010
the back I was recorded

365
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:25,610
so the system where there was no more
about specifics to

366
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:29,559
okay so there's a senator called staged
which is a very simple

367
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:33,678
similar it mission to book your computer
has been around for quite a while

368
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,870
brinker key in the player projects I'm
spend a lot of time reading this

369
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:42,059
so idiots are like pac boots as the top
down view of the world

370
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:46,168
this is actually the weather grows
campus there the building

371
00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:50,070
so there's a little robot here just a
blue dot that things just kinda brick in

372
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,500
the world

373
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,700
we can drive around it so we can messing
with it

374
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,380
see over to see me but the the blue can
appeal with the laser scanners in some

375
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,470
realistic and take this

376
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:04,490
or about enjoying around but was fun as
we can look at see what's happening in

377
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,250
ross we go off topic

378
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:10,309
less says open to interesting topics now
we have

379
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:14,330
the base pose which is this is that the
odometer there about working citizen

380
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,918
world

381
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,559
a story that sexy that's a cheap but
that sucks the weather what really is a

382
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:20,350
similar

383
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,699
this and I'm here Odom that the actual
damages that and I was wondering about

384
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,390
is when the

385
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,559
Everton will turns it x-trackers is that
he's a hard runner about that counts

386
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,020
how many takes the wheel Saturn its ok
to make assumptions such as

387
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,330
will translate and what are the same
size you can integrate that in

388
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:38,480
in get this nistam

389
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,909
the see this command lost the topic this
type in the world a pic

390
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:45,400
info canal that tells us that

391
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,929
stages that are similar subscribing to
it it's a bit type

392
00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:54,190
challenger missus twists and with this
room mechanical engineering terms in

393
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:58,480
a I in so something to move

394
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,320
a see what's interesting here so based
scan is a simulated laser

395
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,330
so we can't type topic ago

396
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:09,350
exc snouts good about

397
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:13,320
permissive numbers and all those ones
are just intense the US's

398
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,600
was a phone since the readings murder
but all this prison numbers are just the

399
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,870
Rangers to the nearest object

400
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:21,330
Israel just been blasted over the
simulator

401
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:25,629
us

402
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:31,370
okay snow its type in this will get are
about to start driving force

403
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:34,979
so no evidence in this guys is cruising
on we can this dragon reduce their own

404
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,659
here

405
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:38,740
resistance consider spinning around and
then we can do

406
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:45,740
the things that I would see

407
00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:50,059
okay Santos's types SMS is laser scan

408
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,299
an analyst at this dynamic in on the fly
in the system we can target these things

409
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:54,510
and answer

410
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:57,590
interesting things that's the one at a
network that actually means

411
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:02,889
so we can say ross missus show

412
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:06,260
so now I run time: it is connected to it
said please describe the laser scan

413
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:06,799
message

414
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,020
we have all these fields and snow we
consider

415
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,340
you can just a custom them are possible
in sort of the pic

416
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:17,459
ago

417
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,169
knows blasting at the screen on the
numbers are changing because there was

418
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:21,360
driving

419
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,408
the proper return a laser scanners
changing some

420
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:28,520
so that the point is this whole thing
this dynamic and just gonna fly with you

421
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,299
can inject

422
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:36,299
what everyone see on the crime

423
00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:41,149
the so simple I'm I talk to beginning
about ross also having a better

424
00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:43,139
capabilities these idiots they can

425
00:22:43,139 --> 00:22:46,219
features you can use on the box
everything's open source of course but

426
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,549
it's oftentimes nights when the

427
00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:50,649
the experts they wrote this capability
wraps it up for you on something

428
00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:55,029
in a bigger black box so there's
ceremonies systems in Ross

429
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:58,389
meaning the you can figure 1 put it down

430
00:22:58,389 --> 00:23:01,620
on a plane surface like this nice but
for here and it will

431
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,889
driver on making out with surroundings
and you can look at that nap

432
00:23:04,889 --> 00:23:07,830
Intel to go from point A to point B and
I'll be able to do that there are

433
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,158
several systems are all switched

434
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:13,139
can do that box a manipulation there's
several

435
00:23:13,139 --> 00:23:17,029
of course it's an open area research but
there are several sub compounds the

436
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:19,600
problem that have pretty good solutions
on the books that are in there from

437
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,230
various

438
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:23,779
institutions and I'm and perception
assertive

439
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:27,399
you want those all the girls about exit
understand the world but there are

440
00:23:27,399 --> 00:23:31,408
against the problems that are a pretty
reasonable solutions like stereo vision

441
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:35,179
if you have two cameras and you want to
do it 30 estimation the world in from

442
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:35,549
the

443
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:38,730
they're pretty decent solutions for that
that are out there in the city the

444
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:39,210
artist

445
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:42,669
is wrapped up in some roster so

446
00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:46,110
assist the movies it's been a long time
I miss talking to him in a remote area

447
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:53,110
that's place them

448
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,729
okay this but it was compelled by with a
gross months ago

449
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:00,940
so there's going to be really fast just
tons and tons a different room apart

450
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,830
from Thurles in

451
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:05,080
Rossi interesting thing to note is that
they're doing offers a different crazy

452
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,100
things initial it is quite different so

453
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,360
we sexing charter bus now wilder abouts

454
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:14,139
manipulators fielder about outside where
everything's kinda

455
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:17,690
that's the thing sliding this kinda car
like

456
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:23,080
mission so oftentimes it's happening on
these platforms as there is a real time

457
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,460
there

458
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,750
happening beneath girls like they
discussed in the now there's a and are

459
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,900
tossed in a different processor this
running

460
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,520
but your office can sit on top and help
with the perceptual

461
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,250
systems that are quite general and and
applicable to many different

462
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:39,720
suzanne is committed so while the
different like that but for

463
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:45,010
there's an hour with a laser on head
when this is done more for separating

464
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:49,370
again ross is it running on the now it's
sitting on top and being birds to it

465
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,070
isn't that

466
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:53,570
later described these are

467
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:56,990
in the collection that's more about
that's the turnabout summit tuchman

468
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:01,590
that for local spot for remote soccer's
always just

469
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:07,770
awesome is our industrial firms are
talking about this also but this is a

470
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,680
totally different world from what we're

471
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,060
can't in terms of reliability the

472
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:17,190
emphasize durability on the system's
looks much more than typical researched

473
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:24,190
this is an interesting project over UC
berkeley folding towels

474
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:32,870
YouTube that person get this going to go
on forever but that is not a different

475
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:36,050
platforms using ross for various
purposes and in a lot of the

476
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:39,710
the work this time can be put on other
robots even if there while the

477
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:42,050
difference in with the subsistence can
generalize quite well

478
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:46,220
ok it's a

479
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,320
ecosystem with some other letters to
kind of characters in a little bit

480
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,370
the top row there I like the cone big
butts are

481
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:54,919
battleships were never gonna call them
the sister to be the thing we've learned

482
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,800
about his kids that we all still dream
about

483
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,610
in is just so awesome which is like
they're about the dessert dishes and

484
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:00,560
fold your clothes and

485
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:05,090
pics appearance there there large human
scale patterns are some

486
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:08,770
some from a building with them typically
one or two

487
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:12,660
arms wanna one or more computers on
board the sensor head

488
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:16,930
very rich platforms I'm that's gonna but
we desire of personally

489
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:20,410
but now we've been seeing that we can
port it and we can do

490
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:23,870
do much more than we had originally with
that we can

491
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:27,219
this ron is on the class a smaller about
seven times that are

492
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,280
much lower cost also which is great

493
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,450
than that third when their industrial
robots is an interesting people are

494
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,030
doing now

495
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:37,510
investor lots are totally different
researcher was there made so that you

496
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,670
can buy this thing

497
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:43,020
you turn it on me set up in your plan
and it runs 24/7 365 for like

498
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,330
twenty years without ever going down so
these the bill with

499
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:50,000
extreme longevity in reliability in mind
because these are on loan production

500
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,610
lines

501
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:54,280
you know it that arm ever breaks them
the whole line has to stop and it's like

502
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,490
a total disaster so

503
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:59,560
the they really emphasize I'm durability
which means that they don't want us to

504
00:26:59,560 --> 00:26:59,879
just

505
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,990
open up the control box select start
running an expert on them

506
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:07,080
and so oftentimes what's happening there
this Ross investor consortium the

507
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:07,629
writing

508
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:11,070
bridges between ross and certified

509
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:16,010
real time controllers that ron is larger
largest there's been some interesting

510
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:16,890
work with vehicles

511
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:20,730
at at some level using ross oftentimes
there's again the

512
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:24,520
hard real-time secular that runs beneath
but Ross is used to try and what's the

513
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,500
perception research

514
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:30,100
two runs up the system those lawnmowers
on the right is in my favorite there's a

515
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,110
Institute of navigation and that runs a
lot more

516
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:37,320
a Thomas competition every year so the
person GPS

517
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:41,740
navigation research but in the end the
demonstration is you can use it to come

518
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,240
along

519
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,860
like centimeter precision feels a

520
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,240
in then people will see 0 snow to do
aerial platforms and

521
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,850
and water pipe runs it and some features
a ver also been used on me

522
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:57,459
surfboards contest its legal system goes

523
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,970
covering the globe this is just a map is
some self reported location for people

524
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:01,800
using ross

525
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,870
and publishing code so there lots
missing them here but

526
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:08,020
it's a interesting mixture academic
institutions

527
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,900
corporate research labs companies and
individuals an amateur group as well

528
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,990
this graph shows little hard to see the
numbers there but

529
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:19,730
their self-reported public code
repositories these are things I come get

530
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:20,220
her

531
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,650
that have something to do with with ross
and when we look at our server logs and

532
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:25,350
stuff North

533
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:28,169
a coalition open source for this problem
it's hard to know how many people are

534
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:28,820
actually using

535
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:33,270
think as we don't have custer allister
it like that we sorta

536
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:37,510
estimate 200,000 users are so at any
given time many that is students so it's

537
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,600
kinda rotating through

538
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,100
but that's gonna be rough estimate at
any given time this

539
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,780
think it's really tough to get her
number in that because we have mirrors

540
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:49,080
in Europe and Asia as well as the main
servers in the US so

541
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,810
at the mall parking on the web return to
help people

542
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:57,220
by there's a massive with your roster
dork which is

543
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,630
you like a week is it a little bit kinda
while that

544
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:04,530
you can search and in to be fine things
that interest in there

545
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:08,399
there are also tutorials about how to
just got the box you know how do you

546
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,650
dunno some things and installed on top

547
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:15,810
and then into some tutorials like I get
navigation system

548
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:19,629
we also are running this answers that of
the dark side is a community maintain

549
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:20,460
site

550
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,929
I think deceptive question-and-answer
site to recover now

551
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:27,780
I'm there are a lot of people who know
Attorney Barbara Boxer of that are on

552
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,139
there

553
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,920
and so course no people search for their

554
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,760
question first and find something that
they don't find it there when persons

555
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,560
could ask you

556
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,960
I'm pretty good answers quickly

557
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,929
so adoption a this was interesting to
look at

558
00:29:42,929 --> 00:29:45,820
we're trying a course like everyone to
reach out and go was a bigger audience

559
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,790
and have our work the more relevant to
the real world

560
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:53,940
we are hoping to of course to follow the
curve when X the governess

561
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,260
and you know that the first column
there's kinda when

562
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,690
the market is grad students we have
extreme pain tolerance and

563
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:03,790
you know if it doesn't work that's fine
it's not like that that's fine

564
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:07,440
if it's like backwards upside down
that's fine a

565
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,390
you know investments became much brought
more brown than

566
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:15,080
easier to use throughout the nineties
the easy to use distributions that

567
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,350
you know everything sorted worked in the
box like that happen to be in season

568
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:22,830
others on in this room serve contributed
to those

569
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:26,040
so there that at that face no a
competent professional or amateur

570
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,580
programmer can download it

571
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,850
and with something torrance get things
up and running

572
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:34,080
with the goal of course which Linux is
now achieved is

573
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,939
when the general public is a system
africa is a continent is that the

574
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,760
picture my dad

575
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,830
he has approached me no pain tolerance
for technology

576
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:44,419
a you know he likes to your website and
read the news or whatever

577
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,460
and he doesn't know or care that the
next during their website he likes

578
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,570
heaven and earth don't have the phone
work and but

579
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:54,149
you knowing doesn't know or care that
the Nexus running behind similarly with

580
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,380
we hope

581
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,510
you at some point to get rushed toward
that thing we're to the point where

582
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,310
people who

583
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:03,210
using systems which are going on so many
and they don't know or care that their

584
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:06,810
thats that's kinda the long-term goal so
to get there

585
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:10,270
worry know that and I we need to support
all the spaces upriver

586
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:13,480
the pipeline I get things into their
world so there's the research phase

587
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,110
which historic this could have been we
have been

588
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:19,800
that's the from products at UC berkeley
that does all sorts of interesting

589
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,928
perception research

590
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:25,670
about how you fold clothes which turns
out to be enormously difficult

591
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:28,900
because use the form of those it's like
a a towel

592
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,150
as are in the process of holding it
turns and all these weird 6 and what all

593
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,300
comes up in your

594
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,149
there because been that's all this is
crazy said justice or to pick things up

595
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,740
and say call the holdup

596
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:41,710
the degree work on that a that's going
to the research phase at some point

597
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:44,220
you know things that are promising
companies are going to pick them up and

598
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,150
invest development dollars and in
certain interest in this interesting

599
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:50,070
project called the HSR platform

600
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:53,678
worst identity is going to be a home's
pick on health care

601
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,030
home assistance to to people

602
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:00,310
so there now that they have different
needs for the research community

603
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:03,620
because instead at the latest was being
they actually need to have in stable

604
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,489
development targets

605
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,730
things that don't so to change at any
them as everyone's working

606
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:12,120
and then finally the the products so
that picture there's a a company called

607
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,500
rethink robotics there

608
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,550
in the US and producing petrological
Baxter

609
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:21,428
so it's an easy to program robot for
factory automation

610
00:32:21,429 --> 00:32:25,110
India there that you shouldn't have to
have a impeaching robotics in order to

611
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:28,040
be able to program a robot to do
something in the plan

612
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,418
and so what they're going to do it at
rethink robotics is make it so that you

613
00:32:31,419 --> 00:32:31,990
can

614
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:36,220
guide the robot's motion in person but
an interesting that have to do it over

615
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,140
and over again

616
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,590
with some computer vision capabilities
baked into it so they're using ross's at

617
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,220
some level

618
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,950
me their software and the great thing
about it is when it's other about

619
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:48,120
in from the start using it that person
doesn't know or care that any that's a

620
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,229
grocer inside it and I think it's great

621
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:53,820
and that's what we're something open to
support more system

622
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:57,470
gets in public and it just works on the
books for people

623
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:00,919
so another use case which lets just
leave them as appears that the RC this

624
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:02,900
is the door for robotics Jones

625
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:07,570
its big deal right now in in humanoid
robotics because

626
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:11,290
what they're hoping to build is are
these systems that can go into

627
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:15,210
pursued a great in structures and
innocence they save the day so

628
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:18,980
this is motivated by the focusing the
disaster another nuclear problems where

629
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,909
they've been

630
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:23,250
you know of course the perfect respects
Mary take six months tan leather

631
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,110
happened

632
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:27,428
if there could have been a Superman that
walked into that facility in

633
00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:30,950
you know new which fell to turn in you
know walked over to return to

634
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:34,070
than the worst disaster in the pan
nearly a serious so

635
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:37,480
this is an effort to try to develop that
kinda capability a

636
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,700
humanoid robot human scale him in
strange

637
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:44,240
that can you tell the operator didn't
see those at the situations

638
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,580
and thing and are projected to get it
broad participation

639
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,899
a have lots of people participate in
this project earnings after

640
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,380
and a very aggressive development
schedule the

641
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:57,280
one thing that's on the back of course
is that humans are fantastically

642
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,370
expensive particularly

643
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:02,870
human scale human strain hydraulic units
like this

644
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:06,500
so what we're going to do to to help out
here is to develop suffer

645
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,889
on top grossing gazebo which is an open
source in there

646
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:13,549
so the thing that silliness can do is
they can lead to look at the

647
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:16,700
stated before the robots actually ready
so we

648
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:19,830
this is a corrected assimilation that
says if there was a robot

649
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:23,219
at the shapes and have the sensors on it
we can

650
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:26,230
see what that means they're going south
reporters if it existed

651
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,850
and if we got the API right and if we
got the simulation resemble

652
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:33,969
them when you get there about you've got
to be some too many things but at least

653
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:38,459
you know the signs are right next year
and the right direction

654
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,480
so busy bus open source emissions from
that many people at

655
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,490
at open surgical technician working on

656
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:47,549
it considering all these different
sensors so with their on the upper right

657
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:50,909
the laser scanner you know the robot's
head we can sleep that those

658
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:54,540
cousins at the world there's an
underneath and the

659
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:58,150
searle or not there is a stacker two
images those are there right and left

660
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:02,190
cameras in there about said and you can
Lord to see if this resolution but

661
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:06,120
they're slightly upset with only and its
exit the magic the current projections

662
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,670
that then

663
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:09,970
everything downstream in Ruskin runs it
was a regular camera we're doing story

664
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:11,850
reconstruction there too

665
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:15,600
I'm to dinner that thirty-point under
the vehicle on the lower right

666
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:20,259
because a similar things like the
nursing units fourth torque sensors and

667
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:23,420
robots recipients on

668
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:29,760
so mysticism demos and see if we can get
a little more dangerous here

669
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,030
some minister took the the similar
everything I'm saying is open source

670
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,190
available on the Internet

671
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:37,800
I'm Rockstar torque is the main kinda
portal to the Ross world but then

672
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,730
there's also

673
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:42,280
gazebo same the Lord for the simulation

674
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,820
or deer season relation to Google answer
would think there's so

675
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:49,220
let's start this thing so happens this
is over dress code

676
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,330
so make an exciting

677
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:55,400
okay now we have the world with the
vehicle in it

678
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,820
with a robot in

679
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:02,730
see

680
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:05,380
ok it's the easiest thing in the fun
thing now is that it's not just the

681
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,740
cartoon is X the

682
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:10,080
rigid body dynamics running here this is
actually physical simulation

683
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,710
you can see there was a little bit going
to war with

684
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:17,890
little tear tear at that they're
actually our position controllers

685
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:18,250
running

686
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:21,460
to hold that Pastor and it can seem
kinda waiting a little bit

687
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,970
with this year the very very simple
controller as sort of a straw man

688
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:27,950
and were expecting course that means
that there with a controller that we're

689
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:32,930
open is the underlying infrastructure
installation to write their own soccer

690
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:36,240
so some things about assimilation make
the real world

691
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,330
you can for grab vehicles liquors
agreement movement

692
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:46,180
with you can take things rotate them
good everyone

693
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:49,359
soul use is not a solicitation so this

694
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:52,740
this window here sorta begun to view
this is not what I hear about me of

695
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,430
course we can write much better about
supper

696
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:58,359
we actually knew the data structures in
the state control in this world but

697
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:02,000
it's not another world is when your
remarks effort to be all you have to do

698
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,800
with the remote sensors

699
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,900
you exit don't get this perspective is
that uses get something very different

700
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,790
which we can simulate

701
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:11,970
here the robot has a laser

702
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:16,350
exits from first

703
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:19,460
nothing much in the typing twenty-fifth
screen organs watching

704
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:22,630
a good okay so no

705
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:26,089
simplify this thing okay

706
00:37:26,089 --> 00:37:29,109
so here there about their I'm all those

707
00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:33,520
our little corner things being drawn you
can feel the anger

708
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,759
what the degrees of freedom it was a
corner brings is one corner from proves

709
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,190
to be a few more about

710
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:41,690
says the moves around all these little
court appears to be

711
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:46,220
would be moving so again as mentioned
before this is the proposed to be

712
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,509
general too many robots

713
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:51,820
this whole visualization tool works with
was actually written for the pier to

714
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,250
your body with a gross

715
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:56,640
but has since been used by many things
it really just looking at ross messages

716
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,509
and putting them in an open field from
work

717
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,660
and so that's why it works with any
subsystem that you or anyone else

718
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:05,230
alright run the world girls this report

719
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:08,930
so this year one is the is really need
another laser

720
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:12,450
in its hand so we can see that because
he's in this order

721
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:16,009
simulated infinite plane on laser
scanners are turning is that it's max

722
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:16,960
remains a

723
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,850
50 meters or whatever it is so that's
kinda boring so we can

724
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:23,850
have but nothing to this year but it

725
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:29,009
we look closely and the laser scanner on
this particular about as exciting as the

726
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:29,339
No

727
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:34,230
can turn around so we can start testing
the spinning

728
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:37,359
the sea

729
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,569
so now that's been a list earning and
the funny thing is

730
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:44,060
we can sing that on lasers being
protected from this bindle so we could

731
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,259
go back to

732
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:50,140
that specialize in a can see that its
this is occurring in the hemisphere

733
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:53,150
and in the company mister this is the
lasers maximum rings

734
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:57,589
to the dinner with anything if you look
closely at what's showing here

735
00:38:57,589 --> 00:39:00,730
there's the vehicle it is important to
listen more in

736
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:04,320
in the gazebo simulator there are is the
physician there

737
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,130
and this is a clear so we can what's
actually happening

738
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:12,220
is a clear here so because it looks cool
in the car has also

739
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:15,620
different colors and stuff but versus
for this thing that all those little

740
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,620
teen

741
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,770
features so what we do instead is we
have a simplified model

742
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:24,080
circus in this is Pete reasonable so we
can

743
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,480
see it was in the car the car so that
made everyone supports

744
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,530
don't think we're really moment closely
as the steering wheel because they're

745
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:31,260
gonna miss

746
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,380
in this doctor program was put to walk
over to the vehicle sit down in it

747
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:41,380
and driver just like you would wear

748
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:46,569
ok no similar senses I mention that has
a

749
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:50,260
we can look at the camera pizza for your
off topic lists here just like them

750
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,070
before

751
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:54,460
now that was much more complicated as a
whole lot more topics

752
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:58,390
we can say that we look at the it's
either right

753
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:02,299
camera from its head we can take that
topic

754
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,660
is a handy utility called ImageView sir
emits

755
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:10,779
you you

756
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:14,270
office were yep

757
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:17,820
but it's there's the interest in
communal about and

758
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:24,400
in my Twitter a little bit easier what
can a wall me standing up

759
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,890
with Peter running as Casey forthcoming
it's kinda funny sister

760
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:33,470
the great part of the earth okay

761
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:37,390
so we have pictures we can then run the
stereo pipeline

762
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:40,500
just like to know more about that
actually has cameras so

763
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:44,070
this is actually what the 30 companies
competing so this is important to know

764
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:44,950
this is not just

765
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:47,669
a point out that we're generating
missing murder it's actually we're

766
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,750
generating images

767
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:52,190
and then running stereo vision on those
generated images

768
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:56,880
second so with us doing ago rx greater

769
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:03,880
because this is a lot more complicated
than before this resolution is not were

770
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:08,470
okay well yet so this sort of Messer
here

771
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:12,370
is the sterile processing step in russia
nothing is out of the box just as if you

772
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,799
had a robot with two

773
00:41:13,799 --> 00:41:16,940
real cameras gonna tear you can see the

774
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:20,370
just like group therapy is in its not
quite would hope for through

775
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:24,420
we in squarely in there's exultation
inquisition artifacts and thats

776
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,490
that's going to get in there was
actually pretty good and so we can

777
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:28,700
corrupt the state and more

778
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:32,259
if it needed to be I'm the other nice
thing with the

779
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,680
like me to the secret this dump all the
messages to this and play them back

780
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,279
later

781
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,810
okay so let's do some work on stuff

782
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:45,630
so this vehicle because missing is
possible to Java core

783
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:49,190
so word is providing infrastructure for
this project when onyx the

784
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:53,290
and going to be competing ourselves the
course that the server

785
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:58,350
shooting so were but swiss roll some
hardcore tits we're not going to

786
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,259
threaten look over there about to walk
over there

787
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:06,500
since the weekend is chief make their
about teleport drop in the driver seat

788
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:10,100
so now he's their

789
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:14,940
exhorted like a gorilla mccook circus
going person think the the

790
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,950
okay so we can look back at what is
interesting

791
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:24,950
sees and dancing girls like that

792
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:28,690
so now is partners core you should see
the laser spins around you see the

793
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:30,130
dashboard

794
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:36,560
the vehicle right there okay

795
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,900
so because this is a similar we can also
she

796
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:43,569
we can just tell the car duster joining
for 70

797
00:42:43,569 --> 00:42:50,569
its gonna put the car in gear turn the
wheels in this dark room

798
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:58,220
nice kind or

799
00:43:01,639 --> 00:43:05,819
okay we can then again and the real
competition you're supposed to then

800
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:08,880
have the robot sign of the driver seat
you know the vehicle start walking

801
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,209
around

802
00:43:09,209 --> 00:43:12,609
we're not there yet so we can conceive

803
00:43:12,609 --> 00:43:15,839
we can just come against their will on
this vehicle and problem the next to

804
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,538
so we can just pull up various is going
to fall over

805
00:43:19,539 --> 00:43:23,219
oh there goes a ruthless

806
00:43:23,219 --> 00:43:26,319
the end up on the side of his vehicle
look at that

807
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:32,069
are is so awesome his

808
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:37,749
there so this five firms in like a
million dollars to it so this is why

809
00:43:37,749 --> 00:43:39,488
it's so fun to do this and simulation

810
00:43:39,489 --> 00:43:44,749
here let's see let's move this car on
the way sicken properly for my ground

811
00:43:44,749 --> 00:43:48,948
well goes other sector

812
00:43:48,949 --> 00:43:53,579
a this is why we look similar zia so
against cancer Superman we can you even

813
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:54,799
do crazy things like

814
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:57,999
this I'm group see if pick up the score

815
00:43:57,999 --> 00:44:01,839
on the job over here and now it's the
quicker I

816
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:06,009
murder ok

817
00:44:06,009 --> 00:44:09,229
it's just too gruesome through the
growing a good

818
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:14,328
so I'm see standing back up again make
you feel better

819
00:44:14,329 --> 00:44:18,880
okay there goes in other words there a
these are the similar tools they're all

820
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,479
opened the whole stack testing is open
top to bottom I'm for free too

821
00:44:22,479 --> 00:44:26,098
download its gazebo thing done on the
bucket

822
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:29,559
which is like ghetto but for material
you know

823
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:34,789
Patrick Willis her forklifts always
gratefully accepted submit system

824
00:44:34,789 --> 00:44:39,199
go on my last night here and other times
we can have some and some question time

825
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:39,880
at the entry

826
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,739
and I'm

827
00:44:43,739 --> 00:44:47,059
okay

828
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:54,059
now as I said what some heads up thanks
for your time well

829
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,560
think there's plenty of time for
questions now

830
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:09,560
wanna bonanza

831
00:45:11,319 --> 00:45:15,349
on so my question is about our support
for multi-robot systems

832
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:19,410
so far you should only single robot
applications and so

833
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:22,569
can you going to do anything like that
but whatever works okay

834
00:45:22,569 --> 00:45:25,710
the questions the multi-robot systems
and with all that little demo that

835
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:27,630
showed here we're seeing the robot
systems

836
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:30,599
and the question is how do we deal with
their or can we do with me through my

837
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:31,049
system

838
00:45:31,049 --> 00:45:35,329
so that's a great question I'm there
were some videos in the circle as the

839
00:45:35,329 --> 00:45:37,319
other had like every two seconds with
another about

840
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:40,519
I'm there were some pictures in there
people doing their

841
00:45:40,519 --> 00:45:44,279
so they can be done that's an area
vaccine tens worker no

842
00:45:44,279 --> 00:45:48,119
in the community lot of people are very
interested in that so

843
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:52,019
for the system you know as as it was
architected originally was made for

844
00:45:52,019 --> 00:45:54,538
these very large about that have several
computers on board

845
00:45:54,539 --> 00:45:57,700
and so connectivity with her voice is
short

846
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:00,629
we always assume that everyone could
talk to the the master know that runs

847
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:01,549
the ball like tennis

848
00:46:01,549 --> 00:46:05,750
as you break that assumption because
robots can maybe go they can wander part

849
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,029
more listings get broken

850
00:46:07,029 --> 00:46:11,289
a what's the thing start to break down
as as is an awesome so there's a lot of

851
00:46:11,289 --> 00:46:12,440
people are very interested

852
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,549
im in making that work well want things
that people do

853
00:46:15,549 --> 00:46:18,829
you can run ross Masters on have a
feature about and then have bridges back

854
00:46:18,829 --> 00:46:20,890
to sort of the semester there that runs
on top

855
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:24,950
that's their implementations about up
there on the internet you can find

856
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:28,240
& Bourke but again that that's an area
one who are working on it now this

857
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,578
that's very for Press researcher and

858
00:46:31,579 --> 00:46:34,299
feel free to contribute with up to have
your answer your in addition to pick a

859
00:46:34,299 --> 00:46:35,279
good

860
00:46:35,279 --> 00:46:40,839
yes I want to ask about your plumbing
lay at the

861
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:45,440
the econometrics bus back team base that
gonna let me add you on the interface

862
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,759
description language but is the
underlying message but something

863
00:46:48,759 --> 00:46:53,480
start-up what open source birthday is so
right now we have our own

864
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,829
that's rolled in there everything's open
source of course but a it is

865
00:46:56,829 --> 00:47:02,119
our own you know we did this back in
2006 2007 is can we started going

866
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:05,990
and then started right as we got to like
or want to release Google released the

867
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:09,979
protocol the first which is like the
same think so you know as we revise the

868
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:13,059
system improve in the future we thinking
about going that just using the standard

869
00:47:13,059 --> 00:47:13,920
systems on me

870
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,470
I'm as it's a it's the custom thing this
done

871
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:21,549
it as TCP sockets from early but you can
also min stop it up for you

872
00:47:21,549 --> 00:47:24,380
the implementation for things like
images where that makes so much sense

873
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:26,259
but thats

874
00:47:26,259 --> 00:47:29,220
that's where in nineteen it's a custom
invitation but we're looking as being

875
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,118
provide assistance to propose that with
anything

876
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:35,170
yes I saw that the eight points not like
http URL spot

877
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:39,539
in fact it's not really HTTP or so what
happens is there's Texas order

878
00:47:39,539 --> 00:47:43,049
it 7.3 trust no one is an actual RPC

879
00:47:43,049 --> 00:47:46,819
configuration their is actually not have
been updated to go there and said that's

880
00:47:46,819 --> 00:47:50,480
what you do with you connect to their
use a water you know is our negotiator

881
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:51,349
I've been with channel

882
00:47:51,349 --> 00:47:55,069
or that's what the HTTP was actually
nationalist receive four tickets opened

883
00:47:55,069 --> 00:47:56,609
up just for configuration nothing

884
00:47:56,609 --> 00:48:03,609
nothing just got elected

885
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:20,450
but I have to question the first is a
which platforms

886
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:24,399
to use part these or wean this is where

887
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,400
words just remix and the second war

888
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:31,340
is if i right module to it that

889
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:35,050
uses Ross how do you distributed

890
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:38,430
so that beers with between those things

891
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:41,640
all the plants birds is or okay

892
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,350
thanks for the question was a two-part
the purses were platforms are supported

893
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:46,049
and the second is a few

894
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:49,150
rodham Ross mother yourself how do you
distribute it was a great questions I I

895
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:50,510
should have mentioned talkin

896
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:54,580
to the answer the first question a do to
you is the easiest to use that's what

897
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:57,720
a lot of people using ross community we
provide more

898
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:02,089
we I mean will grows and we can you be a
little bit there

899
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:06,100
provides Debbie like binary the packages
you can just download and install a

900
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:06,930
supplement to

901
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:11,600
the other thereabouts knows what about
their the use things other than Ubuntu

902
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,730
of course so

903
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:15,740
there are people using the system there
are notes from the

904
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:19,910
on the wiki you can try to follow I
would suggest using Ubuntu opportunities

905
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:21,609
to experiment with things on the box

906
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:25,900
just just up get some packages and get
up and running other Linux distributions

907
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,610
are in various stages a

908
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:30,670
working or not working this Mac OS X
there's some

909
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:34,740
supporter but I would suggest using a
min to actually

910
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:38,439
so the Windows port is a long ways away
we do not serve

911
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,980
moved across the stuff that's sorta just
completely unique philosophy if we have

912
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:45,150
50 processes running which is you know
it can be done with Windows

913
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:48,530
and I think in time because some people
use when as we should figure out how to

914
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:49,510
support a better

915
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:52,790
we were certainly welcome and in all
contributions toward that goal but

916
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:55,800
we've spoke to build system now to see
make I'm

917
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,440
and so that was a dumb hoping to get
with long-term vision for Windows bill

918
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,110
possible

919
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:04,210
and it certainly is just different
company from how people use

920
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:09,010
when they're supposed to and there's a
the how do you publish code that you

921
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:10,630
wreck yourself workers have understood

922
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:13,660
to their own distribution we're not
going to be a gatekeeper

923
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:18,029
code I'm just another political upon get
open really got that people in with

924
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:21,420
build instructions just like just
looking think

925
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:27,570
get the growth and awesome happy to keep
answering questions on

926
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:34,570
afterwards in the would a big-government
way
