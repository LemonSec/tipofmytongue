1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,180
okay I hi I am

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,200
not a paddling I'm going to talk today
about this to me

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,860
on I did talk about system the pretty
much

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,090
exactly two years ago a pass to post
them and the

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,830
yeah so that's like all the talk the
first two years

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:24,970
I okay

7
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,900
I'm I'll I'll start to talk with limited
for

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:35,900
up

9
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,830
on fifty years

10
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:18,680
so up the focus assist in the

11
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,060
has always been a that we kinda cover
the full range of Linux itself

12
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,889
so we care about my while about

13
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:30,680
a.m. et and about desktop and server the
same way

14
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,729
basically means that the basis for
iPhone OS could be the same

15
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:38,818
as for a supercomputer and actually i
mean that's kinda process because

16
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:42,569
because I'm a lot of the the other
suffer like for example are some apples

17
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,830
probably nothing you ever want to use a
mobile but

18
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:49,409
we want to really try to cover all these
different basis

19
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,120
and that's that's actually really
interesting in many many ways because

20
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,789
quite often it turns out that that
problems that are specific to one of

21
00:06:56,789 --> 00:06:58,750
these areas like specific to the server

22
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,870
end up being usually useful

23
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,919
on the other end of the spectrum as well
for example the M

24
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:08,930
about it people they they supply
dispatches for for doing I'm

25
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,029
hopper what stocks to I know what stocks
that is relatively simple and basic

26
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:15,759
just says yeah this device in dipping
into and if you stop doing that the

27
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,229
machine will automatically reboot

28
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:21,080
it's a technique to increase reliability
up of embedded hardware

29
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,258
now as it turns out something like this
is not only

30
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:27,650
you to use of useful for embedded
hardware but on the other hand a

31
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:28,929
spectrum on the server

32
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:33,349
that also what you require for
high-availability about so I'm yet we

33
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:34,310
have this feature their

34
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:38,539
and end up being really useful on the
other end as well and there's a lot of

35
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:39,659
other stepped-up

36
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:43,409
like that what I'm

37
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:47,060
I like for example what I'm doing

38
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,360
I every so and this happens like bring
some results management

39
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,759
I'm resource management basically is a
what you have to do to run a lot of

40
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:57,400
servers

41
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,049
and have limited resources the vial it a
lot of services and

42
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:04,710
have limited resources while you need to
make sure that the Bob resources on

43
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,239
nicely distributed according to your
rules

44
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,810
I'm on the so is that ironic now
resource management has been for quite

45
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:12,900
some time

46
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,378
I'm be important for servers ride you
want to make sure that Apache

47
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:20,870
and my sequel both get an equal amount
of CPU and memory

48
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:25,240
I'm and not one I'm gets way more than
the other and done

49
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,520
SingStar you got all kind of problems or
even more

50
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,338
I get a couple of customer sides running
on a single serve anyone to make sure

51
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:35,839
but not one customer can monopolize the
CPU and the others cock

52
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,329
so you wanna make make sure that the
result is that you have a viable on this

53
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:42,848
on the server I actually distributed and
some kind of

54
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:47,000
way among the services properly now this
resource management

55
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,300
also ends up being useful very much on
the embedded hardware

56
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,959
because an embedded hardware usually
usually have very little resources

57
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,689
so it becomes even more important that
what you run on the embedded hardware

58
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,390
gets

59
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:02,890
gets an equal amount for like the
appropriate amount of I'm resources

60
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:07,649
assign so and the and the lot of
examples like that sometimes there's

61
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:10,910
desktop stuff that ends up being usually
sit useful for

62
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:15,500
for the cell as well or R emmett stuff
that and for being useful for the test

63
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,390
so yeah the same way as a Linux kernel
manages to cover all the bases from

64
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:24,390
embedded mobile desktop server we want
to cover the same thing for system the

65
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,500
as well because we figured out that most
of the problems actually

66
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,100
reappear on the other end of the
spectrum as well I'm

67
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,279
yeah we nowadays have consistently boo
times I'm of less than one second for

68
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:36,970
you the space

69
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,769
we like to do a demo here on Kai's
laptop which is lying right here

70
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:43,800
we're not going to do this on this
laptop because I'm actually the

71
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,519
the initialization times for projectors
like during boot

72
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,930
a little bit too slow so weak you can
actually see that I

73
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:54,300
we have these new times a less than one
second for you space

74
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,589
um of course unfortunately

75
00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:01,350
for dar like us the distribution that I
use and I work for

76
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,459
doesn't really provide out-of-the-box um
a couple reasons for that

77
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:08,599
wanna bigger ones I'll be on these kind
of things I'm

78
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,940
we want to go for sup parking that out
of the box

79
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,230
on for dar eventually to I'm

80
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,279
but right now federal with Laura but
anyway I'm

81
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,029
Chi can you show up I'm sokaya has the
laptop here which runs pretty much

82
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:29,290
unmodified Fedora I'm the only change is
basically that we don't have Albion

83
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,680
and very few other things I am

84
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,430
enabled so this is already rebooted
actually is it

85
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:40,160
its information from the from the last
word now what you see here now

86
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,550
is is that the we we will actually break
down with the system the analyze come on

87
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,059
we'll actually

88
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:49,480
I'm tell you how the performance of the
last word walls

89
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,420
now we can see that the firmware like a
bias and they're the really the post

90
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,959
I'm the initial initialization of the
hardware took a seven seconds

91
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:01,050
the bootloader took 35 milliseconds only

92
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,479
the kernel to took her

93
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,610
as early as you might see this like 35
SAT for milliseconds that's definitely

94
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,880
not drop because crap

95
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,100
like already initialized a group text
second or something

96
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,670
his goofy but actually I the kernel
takes

97
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,979
1.2 seconds and then use the space I'm

98
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,750
currently in this forty required a
slightly more than one second

99
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:28,100
I

100
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,819
in total it 9.6 seconds that of course
not good enough gaps

101
00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:36,120
on Mon a hardware works out for example
the firmware

102
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,589
I like like the windows 8 certified
machines

103
00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:43,020
like Windows the like that if you wanna
have a certified machine you need to

104
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,860
make sure that

105
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,209
your hardware I'm to get the certificate
your hardware needs to put in last

106
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:50,270
month's two seconds for post

107
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:57,270
so was at a place we can improve and
talents which in like five seconds or so

108
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:01,120
so if you if you if you look at this
distribution you like to see it that

109
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,819
quite complete ride we have all these
test of the things like you power

110
00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:08,130
we have you left the anyway weapon
countdown policy kid

111
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,620
colored diamond even like that a problem
profiling stuff about me

112
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,370
like this like and to be the at all like
and GM is like

113
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:19,029
really complete distribution the only
thing that is basically changing from

114
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:22,600
from Fedora default is that with did not
install an LVM because I'll be honest

115
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,149
like

116
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:27,120
it's a major salsa slow up I mean we
have some Albion developers

117
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,770
still oh I sorry I will just say it I
mean has been

118
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:35,189
two years ago and still up

119
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:39,179
well let's discuss that otherwise but
anyway I'm

120
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:42,910
so weekend we did show you just these
numbers like a

121
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,670
I'll positives but let's actually see
how fast that is

122
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:50,339
by Des Moines yet now this is a rawhide
machine

123
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:53,730
so we hope you were acting

124
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,559
but the so yeah now we on post these are
the seventh

125
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:03,630
seven seconds basically and a tie the
screen time blacks when the boiler comes

126
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,800
and already

127
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,349
so yah through it hard to see but you
see actually yeah edited

128
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,079
just got up it's like a that was at once
I got for you space once

129
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,459
second for crown its

130
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:21,949
its actually gray a.m. the machine that
project that but you see the

131
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:28,949
you recognize that this is going alright

132
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,620
the

133
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,620
yep think chain up

134
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:39,620
I think maybe that's because the k
shifted yeah action realized the singer

135
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:40,830
screen what we see here

136
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:44,050
like if we see that gray with

137
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:48,620
the project is a little confused I'm but
anyway

138
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,070
what you saw basically see if you saw
those seven seconds for the post

139
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:55,100
and then you saw the two seconds after
the post

140
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,640
when I was black and then was already
got home about I'm

141
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,319
yep

142
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,030
so I mean that the really the reason why
we use this this week protectors

143
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,870
basically that

144
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:12,450
that yeah well project is usually take
time when when video mother switched

145
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:17,140
I'm but sometimes are usually takes more
than one second so it kinda destroys the

146
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:21,180
the demo but this thing destroy the
Tamil anyway because you can actually

147
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,790
recognize that it's going down

148
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:27,099
but anyway I you see the now sry stuff
here anyway let's

149
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,240
turn back to this live by the way again
if you guys have questions at any time

150
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,170
just interrupt me

151
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:36,199
I'm I'm really interested

152
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,840
and question

153
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:45,610
so yeah I'm we have consistently good
times of less than one second

154
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,820
this one wasn't but the we generally
have I'm

155
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:55,820
the county right now

156
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,590
this is this is pretty much unmodified
that are in nineteen

157
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:08,640
but the was on LVM basically so it
doesn't use anything

158
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:14,280
your device anything that wasn't in an
east on a distribution I i think is a a

159
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,569
better user 19

160
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:19,580
maybe a snapshot of current system be
but that's it I'm

161
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:25,720
okay I'm as we develop system the

162
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,220
we have obsolete a couple of things I
mean absolute years is very

163
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:35,380
white term supposedly here so we we we
placed consul kid which

164
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,939
I'm used to be the stamina managed a
login since

165
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,640
the sessions and the a.m. seeds I'm by
something called La Guinea

166
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,449
which is a component of system I
provides

167
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:51,170
quite some more than conflict could I'm
used to do like for example

168
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,420
problem Odyssey support so you can
actually like if you have modest

169
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,479
hardware like this

170
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,550
little use be boxes that provide you an
additional screen international keyboard

171
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:03,890
additional sound in this conflict can
now plug that into your system eMachine

172
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:07,390
prison we will well recognize that it's
one of these devices and what to say

173
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,410
here's a new seat

174
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:12,130
Dion will then take pick that up in
bring a large screen so and I fully

175
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,120
automatic without reconfiguring anything

176
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,140
so yet week we this complicated it's
much nicer than consul good

177
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,720
used to be because we we can rely on
integration

178
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,610
of the kernel in the way that was not
involved before for example can

179
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,630
easily track membership of the process

180
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,700
office ashen by doing see group magic

181
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:37,470
I'm I'm pretty sure like two years ago
when the weather talking from the herd

182
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:40,980
terms the group I'm not going to go into
detail what that is but

183
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,710
up suffice to say the council could rip
placement that we did with like India

184
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,330
sis usually more powerful

185
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:51,510
than consequat used to be we replace
system five-minute

186
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:55,850
its kinda obvious I and the units goes
back into the net growth package

187
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:59,560
I mean in this case it kinda means like
all kind of different implementation of

188
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,209
that like Devin has its own and its
gives back at some

189
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:06,069
that are used to have it runs well I'm
we kinda replies that because all the

190
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,089
early boat stuff

191
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:10,609
we now it's have paralyzed I'm

192
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:14,310
little implementation will see which are
nicely configurable and I kind of common

193
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:18,010
them similar configuration file we

194
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:21,589
obsolete p.m. Udall's p.m. noodles I
have the job of

195
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:25,389
suspending hibernating this the machine
used to having a huge amount of

196
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:29,830
works like a because a I'm like
userspace quirk stealing

197
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:33,179
for specific hardware that expose that
box

198
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:37,860
but I'm as it turns out today that's
mostly not necessary anymore that only

199
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,820
very excited cop with it still needs
that

200
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:44,230
because the kernel got pics like the
kernel drivers a nowadays able to apply

201
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:44,560
this

202
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,600
quirks and much sign away anyway we
don't need any US base components

203
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,480
so I'm because system the already
managed

204
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,760
powering up of the machine empowering
and on we

205
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,950
added rebooting in these kind of things
we just added some support for

206
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:59,760
suspending

207
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,300
and hibernation as well because it's
kinda the natural thing it's it's

208
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,180
it so that system we can can manage the
entire life cycle of the machine

209
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:11,770
and that definitely include suspending
hibernation I of course we did

210
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:15,990
really nicely like better than p.m. you
does did it because we now have a

211
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:19,150
have inhibitors in this kind of thing so

212
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:23,460
so that of it so use this offer can
actually hook and to suspend process and

213
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,840
do something right before the machine
goes down

214
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,110
which is very useful for example let's
say you have have

215
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:32,709
via text editor and you want to make
sure that that that text data actually

216
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,050
saves everything to do this

217
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:37,280
before going in to suspend so that if
the battery runs out you don't lose

218
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,270
anything

219
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:41,660
and then there are the other you many
other uses for well

220
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:45,630
so yeah we replaced I D that's probably
one of the more obvious things

221
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:49,400
well at least a few know that just made
a socket activation

222
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:54,310
I know for sure that last time two years
ago I did talk about socket activation

223
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:57,540
in more detail again I'm not going to
talk about that very much because

224
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:02,680
technical but I'm so much to say we do
basically everything the classic on it

225
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,450
deeded

226
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:07,880
and system the as well and of course I'm
we try to make it more useful so we will

227
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,760
not discover a

228
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,960
I'm internet sockets but all kinds of
other I'm sockets as well

229
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,070
and even some things that are
technically not release of its like for

230
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,580
example

231
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:20,540
people's oppose text message queues

232
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,430
I'm rem replaced a city ID op

233
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:28,420
I CPAT the little down on whose only
purpose and was

234
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:32,020
to to when somebody press the power key
showdown

235
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:36,650
she that's basically what I did whether
you bigger project LaRose things to

236
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:40,350
but nobody ever use that people just use
that to like her cup

237
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:43,929
stupid power button with power of and we
saw

238
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:47,210
maybe that some functionality that
should not be require any additional

239
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,390
software that should

240
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,100
really just work it's about parting of
the machine especially since the reboot

241
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:52,820
but

242
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:56,220
& Sons contra el del I'm I'm

243
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,430
is is implemented either copper or by
system the anyway so we thought well

244
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,040
maybe

245
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,379
the public should be handled the same
way so

246
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,990
and and everybody needs a ride like like
cabinet hardware servers

247
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:13,110
desktop they all have power but should
work as

248
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:17,050
that supposed so yeah we do so decided
well

249
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:20,550
listening to one key is not particularly
hard everybody one said

250
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:24,860
you should just move it down into system
just do it in it will just work

251
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,929
I'm something our house we kinda I'm

252
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:32,080
replies to this is loc length with
something called the journal

253
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,830
I'm I figure that has been this cuz
while in the community

254
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:40,919
already I'm basically we look that says
lock and I figured out

255
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,240
well I mean we have been been looking to
look for quite some time

256
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,450
them what we always wanted that we can
actually

257
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:52,560
Creary the syslog logs for all messages
from a specific service

258
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,110
are this is loc only stores let me a
text files

259
00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:00,100
from top to bottom without any kind of
inexorable information right it does not

260
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,419
actually know anything from which
service things came

261
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:07,550
basically I mean it's on trusted data
every application can send

262
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:11,590
send data into it and pretend it was
Apache and says look with a stored

263
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:15,760
not care I'm so we have we have a lot of
issues with like we because you want to

264
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,390
have a secure system where weather
services cannot lie about who they are

265
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:22,440
and where we actually have this
information which services did and can

266
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,880
in the exit so that the

267
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,750
that the query of the of the lot better
stuff is fast

268
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,760
so are we're perfectly compatible with
Swiss

269
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,040
I mean follows is that I listen to
basically you still can

270
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,440
and stole a city ID you can still
install sous la grande

271
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,870
and in fact that our does that by
default you can install I need to you

272
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,290
can install still can you talk

273
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:45,320
with only compatible with that we will
not break these things

274
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,370
I'm so the only thing that invested
economist all anymore it's just a

275
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,580
5-minute because

276
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,000
only one person's computer the PRT 1 but

277
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,120
yep it's just that you don't really need
that anymore because

278
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,659
we have it simpler and usually more
powerful in a and the basic stuff anyway

279
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:07,370
something else we kinda I'm replaced as
the watchdog support already talked

280
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,770
about that earlier

281
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:12,060
I'm it's something that is usually use
phone am Adam

282
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,600
and on servers it's not so useful on the
best up but it

283
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,959
absolutely terrible thing to do and
actually should really be done

284
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,310
insistently because only than you have
this nice chain

285
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:27,080
that the hardware watches or system he
does and then system the

286
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,918
watches what the services do arm

287
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:35,380
at actually very simple to use a very
powerful mcg rules TM not sure if you

288
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,900
guys know that at some sexy
group-specific

289
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,980
basically is a dam in that tried to move
during runtime services and a specific

290
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,070
see groups to apply resource limits to
them

291
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:49,970
it was i mean where they did was a very
weird thing because it actually did that

292
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:50,460
a song

293
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:54,600
asynchronously so instead of like right
when the service was started

294
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,909
up making sure that before the service
was for

295
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:01,740
of it was already cleared with and the
see group with just watch what was

296
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,530
happening in the system apply some rules

297
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:07,800
and magically moved into that which of
course

298
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,010
yeah it's it's like than I'm

299
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:14,770
we kinda moved quite a few functionality
that was traditionally done

300
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:18,340
bike wrong into system D I'm not
everything

301
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:22,030
I and we can with only compatible with a
classic stuff but them

302
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:25,879
the many many reasons why it is actually
useful

303
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:31,010
to have a something like run like a
london-based them time in its history as

304
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:31,870
well

305
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:37,020
I'm yeah I'm it the stuff that we have
an interest in this and in some ways

306
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,970
more powerful than chronic

307
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:42,360
but in other ways I'm less powerful for
example we don't do user

308
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,928
up crime jobs anything as a matter that
but we have basically have a clan

309
00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:46,810
language now

310
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,840
but as more expressive then what what a
crime

311
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,370
can actually express it stay like it has
at second round of clarity and

312
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:58,030
them and stuff like that yeah and at the
same time

313
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:01,090
I'm we kinda consider at like the same
problem

314
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:05,918
I'm as mentioned this as obsoletes

315
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,830
but you can still install this all
parallel and and probably most

316
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:13,540
distributions well I don't expect a
refund or for example to any time soon

317
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:16,690
not in stock run by default I mean I
personally believe commissar really

318
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:17,630
useful tool

319
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:21,830
like cum even though system he can
schedule things by time

320
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:24,879
I'm you would have to criticize file and
it %uh

321
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,790
time I file for and admittedly you think
wrong I'm just running online can often

322
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,040
be

323
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:34,250
easier so %uh this is not an attempt to
kinda remove this from the distributions

324
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:34,910
or

325
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:38,040
making this an apology administrator
it's just dumb

326
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,300
yeah we have this insisting the amassed
love the functionality in there

327
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:46,139
you don't have was a classic tools so
you can use it but you know

328
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:51,100
I'm okay so much about the status quo

329
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,199
and low but like giving a position

330
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,730
me like an explanation where we
currently are with system the

331
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,830
have any questions to this point

332
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:05,530
that the question like a

333
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:09,350
just the described sorry earn

334
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:13,500
just a short question do essentially if
you installed Fedora

335
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,640
19 system do you actually do you install
sings

336
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,169
and just minutes east and each use know
just to see

337
00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:25,300
work for I didn't I well what can stand
just all the stuff that you obsolete

338
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,129
ganges the install everything

339
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:30,919
and just like actually smart man you can
uninstall

340
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:35,550
I 19 SEP early anyway you can uninstall
syslog watched oxygen rules D

341
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:38,550
you can mostly in stock wrong but then

342
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:41,730
like many pages drop in crime jobs we'll
work on that that

343
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:44,850
to make that it is possible in this kind
of talk on the Fedora

344
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,540
mailing list to port over at least some
stuff to crown

345
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:52,030
we'll have to see about that in detail
I'm you can remove a TD

346
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:56,090
you con really remove in its group
because things depend on it

347
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:59,810
but Moses stuff you don't really need
any more says five and it doesn't really

348
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,240
exist anymore in consequence

349
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:08,240
I miss not ship by the fall anywhere
anymore what's the limit scripts

350
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:11,870
though i mean the thing that is good
still does that is useful as a static

351
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:12,899
networks like

352
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,310
all the stuff that's not network
management

353
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:20,030
I buddy are you busy Kim removal

354
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:23,168
yeah i was just wondering so on

355
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:26,919
system the interprets the best type
right now includes like virtual

356
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:30,810
units will the same thing happen would
come to

357
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:34,050
yeah that's actually something I so yeah
everybody got a question the questions

358
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:34,990
like currently

359
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:39,590
fessed up does is parsed by system the
for compatibility purposes and because

360
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,470
we actually think that after

361
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:43,630
fast opposite call thing because it's
very simple and things like that we

362
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,660
could do the same thing for for the
crown taps

363
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,900
so i sync I'll

364
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,860
the crontab I'm not a very nice language
i think is very simplistic

365
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:57,639
I'm so my guess is that we probably will
cover crown the daily in crime that

366
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,760
weekly

367
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,879
and and these kind of dropping
directories because they're really super

368
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,960
nice to use

369
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,640
and we can can nicely integrated them
into in the system to as well

370
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,650
but I don't think we'll do the same for
crime but the ice

371
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:13,490
think like for further actual crime type
stuff we can assume that

372
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:16,580
like like Elizabeth a dark case the way

373
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,730
kinda looks like we might convert
everything the actual

374
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:24,179
installs more than just crowned alien
crown weak link on hourly

375
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:28,400
scripts will probably use timer units
but we have to see about

376
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,150
but of course I'm even if the
distribution doesn't wanna go system the

377
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,169
all the way the way

378
00:27:33,169 --> 00:27:36,590
had already decided to do it I'm they
can on their own

379
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:40,129
write a generator for that that generate
the stuff that's totally doable

380
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:44,900
up it's just that it's probably not
something we want to upstream

381
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,540
yep quest this way

382
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,629
just in question and system D

383
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,760
is in to lead to reach you do lot of
systems

384
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,970
like Red Hat mmm soon read at

385
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:02,270
Federer about our clinics butts

386
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:05,810
you are superseding projects like a
syslog

387
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:11,210
and GE asses log so know how do you deal
with communities are you offering them

388
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:12,510
to work with you

389
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:15,610
all so a

390
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:19,310
we actually like like like before we did
the journal we actually

391
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:23,500
II talk frequently to our site blog I it
doesn't look like me very much anymore I

392
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,600
don't know why

393
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,340
I'm at like a we actually like

394
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,629
like we suggest the big we wanted that
stuff right we wanna what we wanted the

395
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,480
indexing and

396
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,630
we were on this is they're looking into
doing that our on our own

397
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:39,419
arses luck I mean they're actually
patches from me and in our says lock

398
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:43,340
for example for the socket activation
stuff that we do in mm system the

399
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:47,320
and up so yes we did work with them

400
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,590
but eventually came to the conclusion
that there probably never

401
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:53,810
would want to give us what we wanted
which is basically in that stuff they

402
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,300
had different focuses

403
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,060
than we had on our stuff and then we
eventually decided to just do it on our

404
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,300
own

405
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,730
one as a slogans you guys I'm he's very

406
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:07,880
like is going to be at the act fast as I
saw I'm on Google events actually

407
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,200
so we have SS corporation bad I used to
be with our sizzler

408
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:17,050
I'm but yeah does that answer

409
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:20,629
I mean offers if you install again
grrrrr says lock

410
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:24,520
it's it's just will work right I'm we
would be quite happy to make sure make

411
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,240
sure to not break anything

412
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,900
in fact I'm like even if the journal I'm
records everything is well

413
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,350
I'm in everything is routed to the
journal is ultimately is a good thing

414
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,230
for our sins lawrence's looking gee

415
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:39,740
as well simply because we collect much
more data

416
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:43,669
by the journal because the journal can
run during early bird in the journal

417
00:29:43,669 --> 00:29:47,669
actually gets connected to every single
serve as a system so that we get tested

418
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:49,409
the alternates to dr.

419
00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:52,740
and we will then for what all of that
from minute

420
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:56,380
from from hollywood in and things like
that alter that did we would will be

421
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,560
forwarded to says Logan

422
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,389
an arse is locked so says look Indian
art so I'm

423
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:05,090
yet they they ultimately benefit from
this and in a way to

424
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:08,720
even so it's not merely necessary
anymore to installed by default

425
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,390
but I mean there's no 222 macbeth no
doubt in the world that

426
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:15,419
this is Logan G&R says look have really
useful

427
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:19,429
use cases for the future as well simply
because the journal does not implement

428
00:30:19,429 --> 00:30:20,270
the

429
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:24,220
the jobs says are profitable and we
don't intend to

430
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:28,980
I'm like I'm it to the call it's a
protocol that has grown over years them

431
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,840
and for most of its history didn't
really have a specification

432
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,428
so it's it's really like a complex
product because you always have to deal

433
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:36,810
with

434
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:40,450
the different ways the hardware and and
and a software implementation

435
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:43,679
so we don't have an interest in that
it's like it's that we told you see the

436
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:44,659
use case

437
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:48,419
for that like if you if you have a
server them set up a new one i connect

438
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:51,840
I'm I collect all the log data from
various hardware arm

439
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,340
it's a different just get better than
Journal but again they benefit from the

440
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,199
general as well

441
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,149
as the journalist this concentrating the
polls way more data

442
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:03,649
this is not traditionally got and we
possible on and we parted on was all me

443
00:31:03,649 --> 00:31:04,428
today

444
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:08,470
if they want so I have a simple question

445
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:11,570
how long until system the emergence the
Linux kernel

446
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:14,700
thanks and also the name of their block

447
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,379
I'll break a audio it intentional latest
Rolling Cooler

448
00:31:18,379 --> 00:31:24,928
what thanks I didn't really get the
questions sorry

449
00:31:24,929 --> 00:31:29,429
I meant how long until system the merges
in the Linux kernel

450
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:32,570
emerged already a lot of stuff like you
there and

451
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:36,040
so on thanks well for

452
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,418
we will probably move a couple of more
things that the system to be

453
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:43,690
prank number things like we we is of
course the question why when we put the

454
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:44,149
lament

455
00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:48,610
I'm like I'm of course that stuff where
we absolutely clear now that we'll never

456
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:49,969
went into the city

457
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:53,490
but basically I'm our definition what
should be insistent is everything they

458
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,470
need to build the basic building block

459
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:58,840
and we will with it doesn't really mean
that that

460
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,100
anything with monolithic and you
couldn't separate things and things went

461
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:06,540
when model anymore it just means that we
develop them in the same get repository

462
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:11,050
and channel coding them its it's not
unlike how for example the BSD model is

463
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:11,990
a BSD

464
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:15,520
much of the car OSU space is kept in a
single

465
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:20,879
I'm CVS SVN repository and is actually
developed in sync with their kernel

466
00:32:20,879 --> 00:32:24,550
and I we are not going that far we never
will merge the kernel into

467
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:27,940
into archery or the other way around
because the doesn't make any sense

468
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:31,020
and then there are other you this basis
for for the next anyway

469
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:35,960
but what we wanna do is as we wanna like
look at what the other units as a doing

470
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,889
and take a little bit back and kinda
like because I think it's a good model

471
00:32:39,889 --> 00:32:43,908
like on Linux traditionally all these
little components that that consist of

472
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:45,480
the food like for example everything

473
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,399
like this with them that was it there
was a separate project 27 good

474
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:52,989
did depository for for the bloody power
key

475
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:56,540
handling it's like that that's not a
bother not something that that's

476
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:00,570
that really scales because every single
of these components

477
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:04,300
how truly feel they might be like for
example a security in the most extreme

478
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,129
thing

479
00:33:05,129 --> 00:33:08,719
they include reimplemented all the
service manager meant they they they

480
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,440
shed a lot of boilerplate code

481
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,080
and what's basically yep all of them
recompile the

482
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,770
rebuild that wrote it in their own code
and most of them didn't really do that

483
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:19,080
actually that while

484
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,350
so insistently we want to unify this
much of this

485
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:26,178
really want to reveal code it's
especially because everybody needs that

486
00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:29,909
because if you Shack code you can
actually reduce footprint because you

487
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:31,340
have lesko to execute

488
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:35,389
and we improve the testability of things
because if you Shaco

489
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:39,260
became much like more likely actually
test the stuff that Iran

490
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:42,730
I mean yeah and then back also this
stuff like if you have

491
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:45,820
all these various component that he put
together in

492
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:49,330
different combinations like many of the
distributions really like doing that

493
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,600
kind of stuff that you can use

494
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,699
anywhere from the colonel was any worse
in a few that was anywhere

495
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,340
Lipsy with any version of and and all
these kind of things

496
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:01,389
its it explodes the task matrics and
that's actually a huge

497
00:34:01,389 --> 00:34:05,530
issue because if you ever wanna ship the
kind of things to people

498
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:09,520
we need to make sure we have a rough
idea that will actually work for people

499
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,989
and you don't do that like yeah anyway
so our approach there is

500
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:17,330
well met some of the basic building
blocks should just be

501
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:20,619
Developments Inc updated think and
tested

502
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:24,710
in sync so that we actually have a good
good idea that the question basically a

503
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:29,090
of them how to to do your design process
how it to you development process the

504
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,300
testing process

505
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,990
and we believe it's we should copy that
thing from from the traditional you

506
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:34,479
Nexus

507
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,730
weather did that morning repository hope
that

508
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:42,399
kinda not that small RRC Group gonna
make it so that I made a subsystem if I

509
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:42,719
have

510
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:47,219
like a simple fork bomb it's not gonna
make midas touch on responses anymore

511
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:51,969
and house I can work so there there's a
controller that this supposed to

512
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:55,439
to deal with smart bombs I didn't have
time to get the question but I said it

513
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,418
was something awful

514
00:34:56,418 --> 00:35:00,109
for pump but that's the right there's a
controller the best book on protection

515
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:04,369
I'm developed by some people are at a
time I don't know what the current state

516
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:06,320
of that estimates going to get in

517
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,880
I'm I dunno yeah we probably support so
that something like that one day

518
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,140
them like I don't it's very specific
question I asked me afterwards I think

519
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,490
I'm

520
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:23,490
I am for the questions that there yeah
there was one other

521
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:28,560
I it's about to compatibility with
previous behavior

522
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,190
in particular things like s'est have I'm
older systems when NFS

523
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:37,430
have failed meant would continue to do
it and I believe that's not always the

524
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:37,790
case

525
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:43,940
by default possibly are you going to try
and continue to maintain that behavioral

526
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:48,030
what's your behavior failure philosophy

527
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,300
I'm I didn't really get the full
question with something about

528
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:53,820
compatibility with a fast up and think
it's more about it

529
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:58,810
old systems if est happen try to mount a
device that was no longer present

530
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:01,810
had failed it would continue to do

531
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:05,070
now we don't do that and it's basically
a philosophy

532
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:09,020
behavior on failure okay so basically
I'm

533
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:12,930
you car you already in in a classic I'm
system five-minute systems

534
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:17,299
you there's all already the flak called
know all too and no fail

535
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,880
and it had disliking nasa meaning that
it has a system the

536
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,869
because a I'm your there's about to be
cared less about that

537
00:36:24,869 --> 00:36:29,310
but basically when you traditionally
already had to use an overall tone no

538
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,049
fail

539
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:33,960
NFS top you still have to do that it's
basically the same definition accept

540
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,450
that

541
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:38,879
yet but what currently happens basically
if you do not mark a file system as no

542
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,930
fail

543
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:43,069
than system the assumes that it is
important

544
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:46,590
that it doesn't fail at boot might be
security standard if it's if it's not

545
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,400
mounted

546
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,240
and then we'll actually like it will it
wait for it to show up

547
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:55,299
if it never shows up then we'll this
system will put you in an emergency mode

548
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,830
me after sandy Kate and Will

549
00:36:56,830 --> 00:37:01,040
give you a little bit of lockout but why
actually and that an emergency mode

550
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,050
so that the approach that but by default
unless im

551
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:08,110
to an entry in FS top is marked as no
fail

552
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:12,130
we assume that everything you list their
must be around during boot and if it

553
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:12,680
isn't

554
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,940
wheel at a modest about it a little bit
different from traditional

555
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:19,830
stuff but that's love it hotter but I
think it's it's technically more correct

556
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:22,930
to do it this way

557
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:27,410
hi I know I knew about it in the UC
group for tracking processes

558
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:33,509
that is very plan to use the exceed you
combine services

559
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:36,690
in the near future so that's an
interesting question actually it's one

560
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:37,300
of the

561
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:41,730
sings I have here on the like it was my
next life

562
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:46,660
I'm a lot container support arm so let
me talk a little bit about the future

563
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:50,089
at this point the process to be like
I've cerise lives here about the future

564
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:52,630
I don't really like to talk too much
about the future

565
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:57,000
because then we probably have to fight
the days %uh the five

566
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,730
tomorrow already today and i'm looking
forward to that but the

567
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:03,800
I'm everything so further for the near
future

568
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,160
future wanna add more nice a container
support

569
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,270
we already have relatively nice compare
support but this couple of things you

570
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,070
would like to add

571
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:15,260
containers for those who don't know are
basically for virtualization

572
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:18,710
where the same colonel runs a couple of

573
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:22,340
operating systems basically site by site
I'm

574
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:26,130
interest in the that is very nicely
supported we actually ship a tiny binary

575
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:26,510
called

576
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:30,690
system B& spawn the just uses the the
kernel interfaces for setting up

577
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:31,430
containers

578
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:34,710
and can boot in operating system in it
for example I'm

579
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:37,960
like it is very useful you can can use
it on Fedora to

580
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,910
to boot up a Debian system and we'll
just work

581
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:47,049
I'm its if it feels a little like like
that change should come on used you know

582
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,000
like the binary

583
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,220
you use for example to to our

584
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:54,359
I don't know if you Missy machine is
broken you mount all the filesystem the

585
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,040
news change were to move into it to fix
something

586
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,850
I'm system can spawn this does basically
the same but in contrast to just setting

587
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,900
up a change should Obama did well

588
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,900
it will set up an entire container for
you um

589
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,020
and then you gotta shall and will do
much more than change what does like

590
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:12,750
mounting things and then all these kind
of things the really useful tool

591
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:16,080
the container support in the system is
of course not limited to this and spawn

592
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,069
tool with which is really tiny

593
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:21,860
I'm it can also support Alex E and
leopard

594
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,119
alexi which by the way a completely
different projects you

595
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,550
the the name might suggest that actually
the same but they're not

596
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:31,990
I'm or any kind of other virtualization

597
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:35,790
I'm that we have the system they
actually comes with a

598
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:39,250
was a with an interface to the contain a
manager

599
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:43,180
I'm so it's very very simple stuff like
for example to contain a manager can

600
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:43,940
tell

601
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:48,250
system the Zuid but the that should be
used to identify the system and then

602
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:51,660
them um system he will use that to to

603
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:54,879
up um to initialize you a view of this
is like

604
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,340
the system itself its three nights I'm

605
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:02,990
in the long run we wanna bring system
the march is the level of what so I risk

606
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:04,109
and it was so

607
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,520
welcome until are there in 20 can do is
is

608
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,740
I'm you cannot only get an idea about
the services running on the host

609
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:14,740
but with the same command you can
actually enumerate all the services

610
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:17,379
running on all your containers on on
your bones

611
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,980
on the system as well and this is all
very useful functionality and

612
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,900
individually

613
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,440
really not that hard implemented we
should provide the same index to

614
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,000
so basically that system control if you
type that and well

615
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,910
yeah show you everything from your host
and the containers inside

616
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:37,629
I'm the container support system is
actually really

617
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:41,420
nice can do tricks but nobody else could
do before

618
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:44,670
I'm one specific seniors is on a
spawning

619
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:48,460
weekend can't Autosport entire
containers on the mock

620
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:53,140
for example you have one container where
you put your passion my sequel and

621
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:57,920
and with the container support system
you can use socket activation for that

622
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,369
so that the host initially this is on
your you actually be part

623
00:41:01,369 --> 00:41:04,430
and the moment the first connection
comes in I will actually

624
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:08,940
spawn the entire container the entire
I'm alas inside of it

625
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:13,570
bows Apache and my sequel in Saidapet
hand over that socket

626
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:17,150
and then the container container will
pass it on to like the the system the

627
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:19,760
inside the content all possible onto my
see grown men aged

628
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,800
the so I'm that s that is a huge

629
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,230
hugely useful I'm technology actually
because it allows you to increase the

630
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,090
density

631
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:30,369
of of customer systems on your server

632
00:41:30,369 --> 00:41:33,910
because you basically allows you I'm to
to run it on Nov

633
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:37,230
containers on one system actually only

634
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:40,900
only have them use of resources

635
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,350
when they actually use this is
especially useful for for

636
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:48,100
for like another a.m. couple of
companies love our web host is

637
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:52,430
which have these kind of one click sings
we can with one click setup attested

638
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:53,589
machine and them

639
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:56,740
test your stuff with this thing
basically comes free

640
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:00,229
because you don't actually have to run
something for that all you have to do is

641
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:00,950
create that

642
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:04,520
like actually make the lesson and then
if actually somebody uses it

643
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,810
you you invoke the container this this
actual really really nice stuff

644
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:12,440
I this all also goes on the other side
dumb how to shut down

645
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,840
which basically means that they are I'm
we have to figure out when the

646
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,830
containers I'll to shut it down again

647
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:21,080
so that you make the best of your
resource usage now the other shot down

648
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,850
stuff is actually really interesting

649
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:26,680
because I'm what I talked about early
about the saying that we wanna

650
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:30,669
cover the whole range of %uh Linux users
from admitted to

651
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:34,190
desktop to server the out a shutdown
stuff like

652
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:37,790
figuring out when a container silent
shutting it down then is actually the

653
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,240
very same problem

654
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,618
that you have on laptops where you want
to suspend the laptop

655
00:42:42,619 --> 00:42:47,119
as soon as a machine gets idle and so
that's one of these nice things because

656
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:47,680
we already

657
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,368
as you are to suspend stuff we can
extend its just a little bit

658
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:54,600
and make it work for content as well so
yeah

659
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,750
I have the kind of the question
regarding containers so it's going to be

660
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:01,330
awesome and it is already off

661
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:07,880
up yeah as the second there is a a
previous question here

662
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,140
thanks I just wanted to ask you to
elaborate on something you said earlier

663
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:14,750
he said when your web server in Davis
sorry system the

664
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,980
make sure they can only see our
resources as they just come down to

665
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:21,730
managing nice levels imposes limits or
is it more

666
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:24,980
so I'm nice levels and then resource
limits are

667
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:29,580
inherently process bound which makes a
pretty much useless on anything you

668
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,710
wanna do these days

669
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:34,640
because Apache is not one single process
Apache is usually

670
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,410
I'm it it spawns worker processes quite
a few of them

671
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:42,220
and these worker processes I'm sponsee
GI processes

672
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:45,310
and PHP whatever process so

673
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:49,640
I'm Apache actually is usually not one
process but more like like a hundred or

674
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,990
so depending how big your system as

675
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:56,200
so actually setting to like the classic
po6 resource limits on them is pretty

676
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,020
useless

677
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:00,109
now what you can to assist in the is
that it will enable you to you see group

678
00:44:00,109 --> 00:44:00,750
for that

679
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:04,810
seagram's the kernel feature that allows
you to group roses into with two

680
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:08,580
into one see group and then apply
resource limits to it

681
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:11,619
so I'm this time as Colonel support it
basically

682
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:15,160
and system to give you very nice
interface to make use of this

683
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,310
so you can basically say yeah what have
ever happens

684
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:22,420
Apache was all its worker processes and
everything cats only this much

685
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:25,670
memory and will get this if you priority

686
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:29,250
in total so even that if my when my
sequel

687
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:33,140
has only three processes running and
Apache has 100

688
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:36,250
processes running because into one for
one group

689
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:40,140
they will still Apache get off and
bicycle get half

690
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:43,779
and it's going to be evened out right so
I'm

691
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:47,240
it's it's it's it's it actually makes
resource management

692
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,890
workable for the first time in minutes
before everything else

693
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:53,830
like before that you could the only
thing you could do basically is is run

694
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:56,220
all you serve as a single process which
is company news

695
00:44:56,220 --> 00:45:00,779
visionary so yeah I hope that answers
the question

696
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,260
it is

697
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:05,589
I any chance we'll see

698
00:45:05,589 --> 00:45:09,069
userspace check mines and I restore for
these containers

699
00:45:09,069 --> 00:45:12,329
second restore good question

700
00:45:12,329 --> 00:45:16,160
I'm that's just say I'm not convinced
that

701
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:21,200
second restores such a fantastic idea I
don't know I matured recon work like

702
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,279
real you know so the question was
regarding second restore its basically a

703
00:45:24,279 --> 00:45:25,420
facility that you can

704
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:29,569
if you have a process you can save the
current state of the process to disk

705
00:45:29,569 --> 00:45:33,119
and then later on possibly have mine on
another machine

706
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,789
you me with that image again and and the
process continues running where it is

707
00:45:36,789 --> 00:45:39,789
there's a huge amount of problems with
that I think because

708
00:45:39,789 --> 00:45:44,049
processes use a lot of resources of the
operating system and getting those

709
00:45:44,049 --> 00:45:46,240
resources like file descriptors sockets

710
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:50,500
internet connections what up getting
those back into the same state

711
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:54,559
as before to me appears not workable

712
00:45:54,559 --> 00:46:00,109
I know the people disagree on that I'm
maybe I can be convinced I don't think

713
00:46:00,109 --> 00:46:00,788
so but the

714
00:46:00,789 --> 00:46:04,140
at I'm occurrence of about the idea so

715
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:08,049
yep any

716
00:46:08,049 --> 00:46:15,049
for the question they ask questions was
another guy

717
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:25,480
I'll what is your we won not taking this
system deep moral

718
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,920
you know the tiny embedded applications
that the class sizes

719
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,970
like boren be it in your 16 MB maximum

720
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:36,459
so is it a good idea to take up this
system the

721
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,890
or the buildroot or busybox based

722
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:43,870
in a tiny application embedded
applications

723
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:47,540
so does it really beat them the system
the approach

724
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:51,240
because this seems to be very
interesting because we are talking about

725
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,500
boot times

726
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:56,130
violently few seconds so

727
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:59,400
we children was locked up or hartmans
Live Nation and

728
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:05,550
sup like me we are dealing with so many
90 sleeps in the start up to

729
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:08,970
you know how r mmm

730
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:13,200
the problem is really impacted where no
we really want to have a 3GS

731
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,279
startup in I don't know services and

732
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:21,320
so this looks very interesting actually
so what is your view on such a tiny

733
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,660
embedded applications

734
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:26,890
I'm not entirely sure I understand
everything about but the question was

735
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:28,020
basically about the

736
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:31,320
using system the like on them that's low
and talk about it right

737
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:35,000
I'm so of course if you have a if you
have a

738
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,670
cabinet system that just wants to run
run process and nothing else there's no

739
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:40,170
point to involve system the in that

740
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:44,510
I'm that's sad I sink in reaches quite
narrow its like

741
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:48,360
I know that a lot of people uses
something called the junction to busybox

742
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:54,460
I'm for example I dunno system is not as
used in wind machines and and cause it's

743
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:55,450
built into cars like

744
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:58,799
Genevieve people for example all
upcoming

745
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,370
cars from any companies involved in
January like the imbalance if I bet

746
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:03,529
well-run system the

747
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:06,630
I'm which is kinda oh my god

748
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:10,240
I'm yeah you find it and and and and and
toys

749
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:15,220
you find it and everything already I'm
I'm not sure how far you can scale it

750
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:15,790
down

751
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:20,160
but you should know that that most of
