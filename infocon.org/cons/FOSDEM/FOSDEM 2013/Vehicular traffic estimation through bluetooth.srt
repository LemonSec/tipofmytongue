1
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,020
right so

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,068
I'm very glad to work are you and
everyone

3
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:12,580
though these don't go I'm follow a lady
and to then going to talk about

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,670
what we have done in both sono such as a
toughie

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:21,980
masters monitoring the crock traffic
through the detection of the blue to

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,279
to in car devices sewer

7
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,179
probably you're no better than me
nowadays in our

8
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:33,239
goss we can find one of these devices

9
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,709
they are just there to simplify then
that option

10
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,809
or our full on why we are driving

11
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:44,730
so the this simple the inc.-ca is that
they're

12
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,309
the Bluetooth brought the ghost say that
if you want to connect to

13
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:51,468
are Bluetooth devices you have to this
call very

14
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:54,820
and produce got when you're make so

15
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,079
I request you have to discover at the
vise

16
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,960
the device it's up to devise to decide
the if is the case to reply

17
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,080
or not to saw if the if sit

18
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,270
if there they devise is set as VZ boat

19
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:15,570
you in reply otherwise a he will not
heal a drop but the requester

20
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,449
so I given then my where the fuck is
that

21
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:23,450
the hold the device is the least that
the in the previous and i'd

22
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,360
ir said as BZ ball just to be

23
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,079
more user-friendly so this means that
the

24
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,070
if we make a app I not the greedy such
as

25
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,439
we are just dis looking for new devices

26
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:41,929
we will get the response so

27
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,200
this simple idea of these doggies duster

28
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,220
is governed new Bluetooth device Easter
then a couple each response with a

29
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,729
quarantine Stamper

30
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:55,320
and then finally analyze the data got
there then

31
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,880
is really eat in AZ idea but is it wants
to

32
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,509
monitoring be great topic through the
detection of bills a

33
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:07,579
in car devisees saw in both una we have
done so far

34
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:11,970
real empirical devises such as on one yr
old side

35
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,520
we were counting the Kaira by pain

36
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,550
while on the other side we were losing

37
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,890
our Bluetooth prototype and there we got

38
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,140
that to with the sees them week car

39
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,519
able to collect at least up water
off-the-wall

40
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,819
they call flow so given these premises

41
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,379
I'm going to spend the rest of the dole
queue due also to

42
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:40,209
these request on saw why is it really
needed

43
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:43,390
to monitoring the draghixa and then a

44
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:48,458
so which technologies I use and then
finally I would show some results

45
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,890
not of course only 15 minutes or

46
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:55,018
that Siri the first that first question
why

47
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:58,129
is it needed their saw in both dunno

48
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:01,209
I'm working on the integrin project that
in the integrity

49
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:04,980
Roger pennies in name proving the
traffic flow

50
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,849
not only to reduce data traffic jam but
those still

51
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:12,540
to reduce the pollution but in order to
do

52
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,959
to reach these big pay too big Bhaskar

53
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,330
we need to got at the top data about

54
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,400
Rafique meet the O a lot of the top

55
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,750
for the city's on I start to think about
how we can now

56
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,519
gotta data both dropped beaker an

57
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:33,780
but when we talk about the did

58
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,790
traffic data we have do

59
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,250
bigger field that this the first one is
the simplest

60
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,390
simplest one so we just calm down

61
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:47,319
the car passing through are a specific
bombing

62
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:50,790
or the on the other hand you ever really

63
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,349
more complex one in which we are trying

64
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:57,780
to estimator the time with timer from
our

65
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,390
70 points in the CT and the when you
have

66
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:06,069
holder those points we can understand
the

67
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:11,140
the travel time and put the oldest did I
know martin riggs and this matrix it's

68
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:11,809
called

69
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,180
origin destination metrics so

70
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,739
nowadays hold the municipality to

71
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:22,159
to create our origin destination metric
whose

72
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,790
camera but this camera are very
expensive

73
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:31,280
but also they are really difficult to
deploy because they must be

74
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,169
booth above their old way and though and
then

75
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:38,430
they need those so their power cable
they need the

76
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:43,090
con connick DVD and so on for this
reason I started to think about

77
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,659
something that could be

78
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,780
done more easily the nummy ca

79
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,440
and so we finally I arrive at

80
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,570
what which the college overuse so

81
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,550
what this is our brought the diaper in
working both dunno

82
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,449
and the I like to call these the white
boxer

83
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:07,340
why wide is a while it's a white box
because is not

84
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,650
let go and the main difference it

85
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,840
okay the main difference there

86
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,650
that the white box we can open e there
and we can see

87
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:22,000
the hardware but not only they are we
can see also the softer

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,690
hold their prototype is barred by boss
tools

89
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:29,560
so from the white boxer

90
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,940
its composite by it's composed of a

91
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,820
but OK R Us berry pie a Bluetooth device

92
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,570
then we have a bot that it and the
combat there on the other hand the from

93
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,169
the point of view of softer

94
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:45,440
we have the operating system I just used

95
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,219
r us beyond then we have a blue logger
log is a

96
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,530
running on the rhea on the prototype at
these

97
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,830
actually in quite important is it's the
dude that these the

98
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,500
the scoring the new devices and then we
have the

99
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,680
vietnam beaker which is duster our web
epically Jonah

100
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,639
that sure the analysis that we have done

101
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,130
so I I will avoid the cool

102
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:16,030
to leasehold the feature of this the
whole Summa

103
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:21,258
God because our early you're ready know
better than me this device but

104
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:25,350
near the point is that we have used
these

105
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:30,590
guard not only because we it's a okay
it's really cheap and it's very small

106
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,169
but also because it consumed us to beat
the

107
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:38,330
mayor are of a anergy and the

108
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,699
this is I am with given better we had
the

109
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:46,620
at the least through this of life diner
which actually was our

110
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,800
and enough for for doing a really

111
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,130
empirical best so

112
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:57,469
world from the point of view of softer
we have

113
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:03,880
or I already told you we have logger log
is in Italy developed by Tom ninety

114
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,229
and actually is just discovering on you

115
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:10,349
devise and each time you find that
devises

116
00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:14,360
he mock the core in pain stamp on a log
file

117
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,380
with the Met goddess of the blue of the
blue to to

118
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:23,440
so as you can see here the coda hold the
code that can be summarized the with

119
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,550
this line

120
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:28,340
the HC I inquired which comes from the
Bluetooth

121
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,489
library he's just making the real

122
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:36,050
we to the other device and then the rest
of the cord is just a

123
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,190
logging them a card is found and the

124
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:43,060
okay setting up the Lu two

125
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,060
wide for

126
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,430
for router beaker okay with a piece the
web at been particularly the web to buy

127
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,879
a plea Ishaan

128
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:56,560
its return in been by don't and that
their

129
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,740
I developed this obligation just dude
role

130
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,099
the the function to analyze the date
down

131
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:07,819
the update but without spending too much
time with this application

132
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:10,849
I E invite you to visit the the

133
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:14,770
this website where the publication is
running and ofcourse the

134
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:18,169
if you leak on compare origin
destination

135
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:24,599
you will find a hold the a knowledge
that we have heard on

136
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:29,490
so before Beach the thought what kind of
result they've got

137
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:35,330
so I R the most important experiment
that we have done in the month of

138
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,430
december

139
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:39,630
was putting two different prototypes

140
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,208
wanna freak Lomita hallway from the
other one

141
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:48,529
and the idea he your was to understand
the

142
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:52,200
the damage summertime to reach

143
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,720
to pass through a Mb and to do that

144
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,430
we have just collect hold a macaw the
National hold the Bluetooth devices

145
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:04,029
this caller and then in eighty and then

146
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:08,080
we have from this set of the make
congress we have

147
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,880
scene which one was also in this set of
be

148
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,640
and the given that we have that all
these jewel

149
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,640
lines and as you can see

150
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,550
this okay so this July's come from a
one-off

151
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:29,060
it's from a the seven of December and
other one from the 14th of December

152
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:33,810
both of them are Fridays but then you
can see how long did they

153
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,680
the shapes are almost seem a lot month
and something he's DJing

154
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,019
is changed and of Dar

155
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:45,779
at seeks bpm so here the point is that

156
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:49,000
we a in a

157
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,100
you need the league the a tough December

159
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:58,940
weekend there

160
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,290
and so the lot the blue line

161
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:06,459
it's a of course of Friday's 7 December

162
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:11,619
in which so weak have got a lot of
duties that came to this CD

163
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,870
and saw they whole

164
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:18,720
these new low traffic flow we got the
hola

165
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,170
the damaged another time a and I was
increased

166
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:29,680
in me so the for the next step

167
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,829
we have just got this so we have a a lot
of next step

168
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:37,180
though as a you probably a over unders
then

169
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:41,380
understood sir the I done just

170
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,689
the two days deployment just strolled

171
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:48,730
things deployment to court because the
prototype was barred by

172
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:52,440
Abati so did the first next their

173
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,390
East about making are very long
deployment there

174
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:00,130
and to make a very long deployment the
first thing is that we need the solar

175
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,390
panel

176
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,579
but its solar panel then is not enough
because

177
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:07,899
if we have a a long deployment

178
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:12,110
we want also to have a real date up
sorry I'll data coming from the

179
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,339
prototypes

180
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:17,240
so we need the committee DVT so we have
somehow to our the

181
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,970
our wifi E or 3 GE

182
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,940
devise but and then from the point of
view or softer

183
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,620
we okay blue dog needs are better are

184
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,540
sees them to care to cash their devices
found a

185
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,099
are and booted off peak something to
improve the graph

186
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:41,019
and the map navigation an

187
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:44,829
okay so this brings me to the hand of
the representation

188
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:49,399
them presented a just the enough done at
the Opera to monitor be cranked up the

189
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:52,860
and the good things that hold the system
is barred by

190
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,410
forced tools saw is not there

191
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:03,790
is not already ready for our for the
production what we hope that the

192
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,819
if someone is able to help us we will be
able to deploy sup

193
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:12,610
to created something that the a lot of
municipality we will be able to

194
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,790
to use those thank you very much for
your aunt sanction looking forward to

195
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,490
