thank you the Fon good

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,410
afternoon to everyone i'ma

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:10,340
cabinet the knee I E work at the
University will be me

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:15,049
and they guess you can smell a my
dressing called the and my slides was

5
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:15,790
may like

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:20,560
they make a but nevermind then and their

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,570
I'm here to talk a me to beat her

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,760
about the any idea that that we got
there are two units do with the name

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,359
to organize a complete D Sean the true
wats ur

10
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,660
software men then be and

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,669
easy although all reading then the stuff
like that

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,250
saw before the line

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,289
booster what these may objected these
talk

14
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:51,190
then what is the problem with the
solution

15
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:55,180
what what we are doing right now and
second usual

16
00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:00,010
yes that economic so mad JTV

17
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,699
easier %ah to tell you about

18
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:08,310
these India about how to the nines
competition that awards

19
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,950
softer quality and

20
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,820
why we wanted to do that

21
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,929
because lovefest the ball against
something to destitution

22
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,520
also we are still working

23
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,179
on the stuff so we are open to feedback
we will be very happy to hear feedback

24
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,140
from

25
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,600
for you and also of course we

26
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,759
are also searching for competitors
because competition with that compact

27
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,329
those it's now not going anywhere so

28
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:48,149
the problem our idea

29
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,399
was a you know norm usually

30
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:54,909
people both does Tom name for zeese on

31
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:58,180
qualities of the qualities like her
efficiency

32
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,909
or maybe help past you can call that
there is that these well-known

33
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:06,840
IEEE Extreme Programming Competition or
maybe also

34
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,780
in Jane your solution walls stuff like
that but

35
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,340
to that are not meanie the

36
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,599
competition that awards other but
software that

37
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,079
in our PR are also the importance these

38
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,629
how good the softer is greeting how easy
is

39
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:29,810
two-man team to read modify I have some
experience

40
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,670
email modifying Purcell scored all from

41
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,780
both to correct maybe mine a boxer

42
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:43,120
I am sometimes modified name for my war
world converged a signal processing

43
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,060
and in his PJs win for example the

44
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:52,300
well-known now program that they wanted
to modify

45
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,360
for all using my researcher

46
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,700
and the called eases so confusing

47
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,609
that in there and I give up so we
decided to track you

48
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,769
beat the competition better wats also

49
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:12,319
this time alva quality

50
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,849
the scandal committee shot not calm

51
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:20,709
in the trees very good way rezone it's
easy

52
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:24,709
you miss you how fast you can called AC

53
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:27,739
called the a shuts off guard

54
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:30,909
stop stop 50 means

55
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:34,500
that's easy it's easy to miss you

56
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,830
how effecient problem ease stop

57
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,260
stop but stocks

58
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:46,409
back to how can meet you miss you
something like her

59
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:49,548
how easy's to read the problem

60
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:56,170
how users to change it to the body the
solution that comes to mind

61
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:00,129
Easter your review having someone

62
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:03,670
look at the cord NC all these woodham

63
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,988
the only thing these not so worried this
song

64
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:10,519
but apart repeated you is

65
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:15,189
quite subjective in people head usually
very strong opinion on

66
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:18,899
about 20 orkut the stars for example

67
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:22,710
engage in the Tyshawn just in the meat

68
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,758
me do check home in your view

69
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,820
do no want to bet on that issue reason:
okay

70
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,219
good khomeini a view do

71
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:41,009
lobby the do like you to Cain's

72
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:44,910
okay I guess the other one just he could

73
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:50,060
okay I include the second group by the
way

74
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,520
casing conventional do you prefer

75
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,530
on the school's came a conventional
makes conventional

76
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,340
in those cities this so called her
section title combination

77
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,739
that her makes up but gays knowns and
their apps

78
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,750
liberties Jens

79
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,139
code blocks heil

80
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:15,370
how do right blocks his way this way

81
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,229
large in banks morning then using top as
is basis

82
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:23,240
if you want to start the inning ending
are really do war

83
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,320
you just being visa

84
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,849
out Mintzer some news group or something
like that

85
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,979
and also if you go to obj that yet
program me

86
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:38,659
you backed up craziness anytime soon
Alba combination on those are just

87
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,690
do that to I experienced

88
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,750
so all peer review is not the really

89
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,180
a good solution we need is sound we

90
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,539
you me sure in some but say

91
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:57,270
50 objective way we don't think that the

92
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,669
our solution eased day with ultimate
solution

93
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:04,698
but them something back have been peer
review

94
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:07,910
the DA he's if you want to miss you for
example

95
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,919
how easy is to debug called and

96
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:15,180
how reduced is a Calder respect you

97
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,729
who and a premier us

98
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:22,030
well let's just right so

99
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,659
these is our recipe d

100
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:30,330
hand the pool of programs

101
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:35,550
have the programmers write some code

102
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:39,400
bank speaker a handful on the so-called
this

103
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,620
olives gives

104
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,840
the called to the spoilers

105
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,758
and this bonus we the United objective

106
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,949
is you boo

107
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:59,520
is to put the summer nasty subbed on

108
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,549
maybe randomly appearing bucks

109
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,620
the cool

110
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,910
then you get the summer bad records

111
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:13,199
you take a handful of

112
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,319
Compass bowl lives give

113
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:22,039
the bug called them let me be me

114
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:25,419
and the made you how much time

115
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:30,229
the compass boys need to the bug because

116
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:34,630
at the end of the day you pay have a
data set

117
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,630
where you have arm spoil the program

118
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:43,719
counters boiler and the back in time

119
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,349
into TV bagging time

120
00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:52,240
easer functional alva the quality of the
region program

121
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,580
if you write her enough resemble from

122
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:00,190
apps obfuscated see that's very easy to
put a bug

123
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,199
me and the

124
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,990
the quality of the compass boiler

125
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,310
aimed at on the other me the

126
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:15,250
minsky you have this polar

127
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,580
and this body weight

128
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,599
this body weight easier in major
although

129
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,449
the amount to called the changed by the
those by this baller

130
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:28,720
of course if you let this board change

131
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,909
completely the Calder it's too easy to
put it bugs me

132
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:37,419
in order to take account that the the
more ride

133
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:40,799
her the easiest with bug we take your
car

134
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,660
also these is bowling wait to we steal
us to work you know

135
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,740
Wachter rooms body weight means sir

136
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:52,050
formally but more or less to be the
number a lane change to something like

137
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,519
that

138
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,580
saw in the end we have

139
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:05,560
day said times the the paints on

140
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,018
those quantities and we wanted to speak
to

141
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:13,240
the that we have into the quantities in

142
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,029
for bed we need better in model

143
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:22,110
basically we say better I know if the
company

144
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,149
a we say that the debugging

145
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:28,279
Dainese a financial all this core the
program

146
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:31,790
over the score of this boiler as core
the counter spoiler

147
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:35,529
last are this polling wat

148
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:39,459
boss Osama random noise because of
course her

149
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:44,040
the paints a um on maybe many other
buddy it was that you cannot

150
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,189
and the the idea is that we have a

151
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,779
so you we have a sitter but we shall
wanna we shop for

152
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:58,399
each will contest for the program

153
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,950
in the week have at this number unknown

154
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:06,110
these number program miss the numbers
polyps number punters pollens

155
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,260
in the field eight enough the to

156
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,399
you can solve the previews set the quiz
show

157
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:16,399
maybe byee peace plan to something good

158
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,649
those are just the peace that we need
speaks about

159
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:22,769
days a day the day

160
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:26,100
we have score for everyone so we can
give

161
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,529
rises 2011 we pray we

162
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:32,810
there what's the best programmer the
best spalla

163
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:37,018
and the best Compass Point so the idea
