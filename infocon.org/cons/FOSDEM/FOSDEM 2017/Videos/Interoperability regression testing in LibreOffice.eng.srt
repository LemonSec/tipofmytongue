1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,029
Oh

2
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,250
[Music]

3
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:13,269
[Music]

4
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:58,899
so basically you can use it with

5
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:25,180
so she says no muck and he first

6
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,080
presented each other

7
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:42,910
later on he percentages in the so this

8
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,200
conference it was the first time I I

9
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,320
knew about this food so I talked to him

10
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,310
about it and we thought about using it

11
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,680
in the office to to find regressions in

12
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,290
so here you can have there the code you

13
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,680
can find this is a me know standard

14
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,750
repository and here you cannot just use

15
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,950
a presentation

16
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:18,250
so basically when I talk forgiving in

17
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,209
Breda we thought it could be a good idea

18
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:26,290
to use it in a master a master branch so

19
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,690
we could find interoperability

20
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,790
regressions on soon as possible

21
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,940
then idea is to reduce as many files as

22
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:40,000
possible and then as many of the box we

23
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,400
will have inbox Allah are related to

24
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,170
microsoft office

25
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,290
the format state they just we thought

26
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,970
that the best would be to compare it

27
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,060
against my person for most but we would

28
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:59,330
use any other office to compare so some

29
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:04,760
numbers from Mozilla we are well I use

30
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,250
basically the fu word figuration and if

31
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,130
you want some keywords in nicosia so I

32
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:14,989
use this racial humor and field keyword

33
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:20,440
and we have right now 40 up integrations

34
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:31,270
69 70 seats I don't eat relations or

35
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:36,050
here we are 18 relations of the other

36
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:46,720
than 76 so yeah the numbers then I

37
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,220
started working on this attitude and

38
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:56,090
some some broccoli so I just fix them

39
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,720
and I also add support for embedded

40
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,000
documents and then I not a possibility

41
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,660
to have different outputs funds because

42
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,450
what mirrors did was just to reduce

43
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,150
different input price but you could

44
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,300
there was only one output file so now

45
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,669
it's possible to have different output

46
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:22,970
files and now I mean with the filter

47
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,319
machine

48
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:29,789
music so now it's possible to move first

49
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:32,969
day what you see locally so my memory

50
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:35,159
was that really so it was complicated

51
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:41,819
but now the pharmacy with in your eyes

52
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:51,930
so we have finished and here my coat so

53
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:56,789
this is nowadays these are the format's

54
00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:01,889
we are tested so though gives the idea

55
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:07,949
and fifty years I mean 50 yeah

56
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:09,839
basically in order to to get the price

57
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,580
I'm using a script

58
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:18,270
I think : yes so basically we are just

59
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,619
making the punch from all these tokens

60
00:06:21,619 --> 00:06:27,300
so we have many documents available so

61
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,830
basically how this Tool Works

62
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,719
we are these bunch of documents here and

63
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:36,029
let's say these arguments are the equal

64
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,669
format would say doc the Nuggets and out

65
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:42,029
here so basically what we do is we

66
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:47,159
converted this to PDF so we see how it's

67
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:49,949
imported into P into LibreOffice and

68
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:53,039
also we we define the output format we

69
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,589
say it's dr. geeks and ATF so that we we

70
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:01,769
compare it with LibreOffice to those as

71
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:07,860
well and FM this format open and name

72
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,350
Microsoft Office because it is rated we

73
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,110
want to compare it away and then finally

74
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,040
we get a PDF for four for each format

75
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,650
and then on the other side at the same

76
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,470
time we open it with Microsoft Office

77
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,410
and then we generate the PDF and

78
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,780
eventually we compare all these PDF

79
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,450
against this one so we use the

80
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,050
horizontal alignment and comparison

81
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,750
comparison side-by-side under over a

82
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:43,450
page separation so that we have four yes

83
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:53,200
four four numbers so basically since we

84
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,960
are testing we test with this with his

85
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,400
hood when the first one with as liberal

86
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,090
of the support here then we with has

87
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,880
relevance liberal is the spot so all

88
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,710
this all this power distance has been

89
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,790
developed with support we also have

90
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:16,030
support because from let's say we we

91
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,250
find a problem here in the competition

92
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,410
attack week when with that when we test

93
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,120
that while a liberal is we see is

94
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,970
correct so then we exported as we seen

95
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,289
as a problem you see that we hate this

96
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:30,729
phone so we are also testing we have so

97
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:34,169
as we are using any timeouts we are also

98
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:36,640
finding well I could find

99
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:43,979
while the Samsung Ipoh and an escort

100
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,400
I put out to find that sometimes let's

101
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,850
say we generate don't find then we try

102
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,460
to open it in Microsoft okay then we

103
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,670
have a corruption problem so then that's

104
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,110
something something we are also testing

105
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:12,050
with this disorder and so I'm going to

106
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:20,900
show you an example of how this tool so

107
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:25,670
basically once we we run the discreet in

108
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,060
the end without this spirit ship

109
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:34,630
so basing it in here we have the import

110
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:38,960
part and he M not the export part so

111
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,860
here this R this is something that ND ee

112
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:48,040
so right now I test it with a 64

113
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:53,930
document it non regression so let's see

114
00:09:53,930 --> 00:10:02,270
an example here and I used I used this

115
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:11,090
bit which i think is the first comic and

116
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:18,640
I also use master be committees

117
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,730
so for instance let's take a look at

118
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:27,140
this is fine so here if you have the

119
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,160
cooperation side by side

120
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:35,230
and this is a new blockage which is

121
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:41,240
correct on the other side if we say this

122
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,430
one which Microsoft Office one young

123
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,180
master

124
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,360
between those are the relative to a

125
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,000
little bit master something what our

126
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,820
relation was introduced here so this is

127
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:02,660
a side-by-side comparison we can say up

128
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,970
there

129
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:08,210
this one yeah this is the overlay

130
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,780
operation

131
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:31,970
and finally you can see that these

132
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:35,779
numbers - - it means that something was

133
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:39,550
introduced via configuration sometimes

134
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,170
it's not a mission you just check it and

135
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:53,959
you see that you can also use it to to

136
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:58,820
see improvements I I don't know yeah you

137
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:03,020
have this one this was an awful spider -

138
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,410
I think this one the ballots were

139
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:10,640
incorrect but he took it with a live

140
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:22,459
novice master say for lunch if

141
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:39,219
government system

142
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,079
yeah we see that that's different but

143
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,079
for instance we see that here you have a

144
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:58,309
debate and in liberalism was it

145
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:11,180
so I can find it now

146
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:12,419
and it's called like that

147
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:54,490
what you do is be tasting a spit

148
00:14:54,490 --> 00:15:00,850
well it takes some time because yeah

149
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:05,530
let's say if I use thousand documents

150
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:10,070
takes about the first time it takes

151
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:13,610
about a couple of days then next time

152
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:16,190
because you already have but what we do

153
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,010
here is okay we compare it let's say I

154
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,950
want to test master right now so I just

155
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:25,280
a previous person as a comparison and

156
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,170
now I have that the comparisons in a

157
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,930
week or after sometime I want to test it

158
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,960
again so I have already master so I just

159
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,210
need to generate this PDF and all the

160
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,650
files for the new master

161
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,410
so then is half of the time so the first

162
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,020
time you run it so let's say four

163
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,090
thousand of documents it takes a couple

164
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:47,210
of days then it's one day but then you

165
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:53,510
have to have a lot of time in this state

166
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:58,520
when we are generating two doggies RTF

167
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,900
and output files then you you need three

168
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,470
types of

169
00:16:28,320 --> 00:17:39,310
okay we are as we are limiting the pages

170
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,800
is not that severe or so it is

171
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,640
cooperation the water scenario may be

172
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,830
given into this cooperation so we have

173
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,460
you know

174
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:15,039
[Music]

175
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,299
[Music]

176
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,389
[Music]

177
00:18:47,389 --> 00:18:53,070
differences in the video but yeah there

178
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:58,970
are some specific so for you

179
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:14,669
I found what just one so let's get the

180
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:19,020
code with PDF polish note that comes no

181
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,919
it's not as much cultures don't or dog

182
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:26,010
filter and why not so there are more

183
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,470
things going on in the dog the dog

184
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:31,559
talking straight and so on so it is more

185
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:34,320
common to find our relationships in dog

186
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,879
with the importer

187
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:56,460
but we need is to meet a reference then

188
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:01,200
we know it's although we are testing

189
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,419
here is my proposition from taxes
