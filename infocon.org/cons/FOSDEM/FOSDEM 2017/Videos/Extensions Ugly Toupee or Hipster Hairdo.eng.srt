1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
you

2
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,349
case that's microphone working okay

3
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,540
great

4
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,520
yeah it's about time to start wake up

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,770
again everybody yeah what I'm talking

6
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,079
about today come on back again to that

7
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:33,730
topic of LibreOffice extensions and the

8
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,700
implications they have on us developers

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,900
doing our work or how they sometimes

10
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:48,370
hinder us so to see what the issue is

11
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,580
with extensions but the same bubbly that

12
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,910
earlier today was all in price of

13
00:00:54,910 --> 00:01:00,040
extensions how they helped us by keeping

14
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,220
all this extra stuff out of our way of

15
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,490
the developers way but of course there's

16
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:10,299
also implications to that and in the end

17
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:13,420
nobody of us developers does love

18
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:20,439
extensions because yeah they what's the

19
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:26,979
what's the summary they keep getting

20
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:29,590
into our way we always need to make sure

21
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:34,569
take care that those points where we can

22
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:37,329
where the extensions can interact with

23
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:41,560
the core but these points keep working

24
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:47,249
and it's not even always easy to tell

25
00:01:47,249 --> 00:01:50,939
what these points exactly are and

26
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,770
whether if you do something you'll

27
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:57,069
actually break them in a way that

28
00:01:57,069 --> 00:02:00,399
extensions no longer will work for

29
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,920
example do you spot the error in the

30
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,979
previous conversation Torsten do you

31
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,979
know

32
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,510
the error in there the back where's

33
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:21,290
where's the thing that that's not an avi

34
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,850
problem with a let and the light bulbs

35
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,920
because the LED bulb is a perfect

36
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,290
replacement for the light bulb so from

37
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,680
the interface perspective this pounds

38
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:43,530
here and if anybody is curious what we

39
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,340
developers do all the day then don't

40
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,870
know is that you get a quite different

41
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,269
picture of what you might have thought

42
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:57,720
Liberals developers are doing for a day

43
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,260
job so yeah after that example shows

44
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,940
it's sometimes difficult to to tell if

45
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,820
they're incompatible will that prove to

46
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,269
be a problem for our extensions or or or

47
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:16,980
not then on the other side of the divide

48
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,709
there's the the users and the extension

49
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:25,230
authors and I send back reports this is

50
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,190
one run in example more or less

51
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,299
something stopped working

52
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:34,590
the interesting bit about this back

53
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,730
report is that it is due to some commits

54
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,410
but I did that's not the interesting

55
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,620
part there's more of those and the

56
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,810
interesting part is that I thought long

57
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,750
and hard about whether actually doing

58
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,060
this change will be compatible or

59
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,150
incompatible and what this boils down to

60
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,760
is that in our C++ code we have

61
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,190
different types representing the you

62
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,709
know types and there's one type for for

63
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:04,290
you know character and that used to be

64
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,450
the same type as the one we used for the

65
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:10,680
small unsigned integer types and because

66
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,320
C++ wasn't expressive enough in its type

67
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,940
system to have different types for these

68
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,160
so they were combined into one come

69
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,478
along C++ 11 with a new type for larger

70
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,260
characters so

71
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,750
we finally were able to split these two

72
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:30,130
into into two that makes the code easier

73
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,410
there's some special cases in the code

74
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,900
that can go away there's even some bugs

75
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,910
lurking in the code because one type was

76
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,190
was used up the other one in places

77
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,280
where it shouldn't be so and on the on

78
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,160
the interface for Forex for C++

79
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,050
extensions I checked carefully that

80
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,820
there was no place where this would

81
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,430
cause any problems so there shouldn't be

82
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,590
any problem with C++ extensions but as

83
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,050
it turned out it caused a problem for

84
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,470
basic code because there was a back kind

85
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,920
of back in the writer core C++ code

86
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,530
there is one case where you can have an

87
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:10,480
a value that is a single character you

88
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,730
usually don't have that because it

89
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,380
doesn't make much sense anyway with

90
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,420
Unicode to speak about single character

91
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:20,740
so single utf-16 values but there was

92
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,050
one one case where there's some

93
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,480
separator for some sorting and I don't

94
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,410
know

95
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,470
and the write the back in writer was

96
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:36,160
that it used the the integer type

97
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,170
instead of the character type and the

98
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,480
problem of basic is that it doesn't have

99
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,380
a character type either so it puts in

100
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,970
when when you want to use that interface

101
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,250
from basic you put in an integer value

102
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,590
representing the character and now

103
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,020
suddenly writers started to no longer

104
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,020
accept an integer there but insisted on

105
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,210
having a character and and and that

106
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,570
broke it and there was no way for basic

107
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:06,670
to to to fix that in basic and and put

108
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:10,450
in a character so first I thought oh my

109
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,090
god I broke everything because now will

110
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,330
that change now there's no longer any

111
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:19,270
interoperability between the basic code

112
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,580
and the radical but then I check

113
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,020
carefully that there's just this one

114
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,260
place where where things go wrong and I

115
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,920
said oh I just fixed that and sweep it

116
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,290
on the carpet and you never know about

117
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,770
that issue

118
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:42,449
so again to summarize the other side of

119
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:44,699
the divide the users and the extensions

120
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:47,909
office they don't like uncomfortable

121
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:51,569
change of course and began it's

122
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:54,449
sometimes quite hard to tell whether it

123
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:57,539
change is compatible or incompatible you

124
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,849
try to do your best and still you you

125
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:05,340
get it wrong so coming back to the start

126
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,509
of the talk this is where we are having

127
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:12,889
problems with these beloved extensions

128
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:16,949
but we as the core developers I mean I

129
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:20,939
for one can't even operate the the

130
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:23,750
impress part to create decent slides and

131
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,460
far less do I know what what people out

132
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,909
there use Libre Office for to create

133
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:32,810
extensions and stuff like that so

134
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,009
extensions for as core developers are

135
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:38,250
always these scared beasts out there yet

136
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:43,199
in the wall that you rarely do spot and

137
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,360
and and you don't know much about them

138
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,770
so it's this caring about extensions

139
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,409
thinking oh my god shall I have to be

140
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:57,089
careful to not break anything there

141
00:07:57,089 --> 00:08:00,180
because it's something that is legend

142
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,339
tells that it is twice wear wear

143
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:06,650
extensions plug-in is better all wasted

144
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,629
fears because we don't even have any

145
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:12,839
extensions or are all these extensions

146
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:15,240
so ugly that you don't want to care

147
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,319
about them anyway so yeah I wanted to to

148
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,740
learn on what side of this guinea pig

149
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,560
the white we are whether we are the the

150
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,529
ugly one the more beautiful one so went

151
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:36,690
to the new or newly revamped

152
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,450
and that's not here no hehe did most of

153
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,970
the part of the work there to get this

154
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:46,140
to get our extension side into better

155
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,610
shape again and into a decent shape and

156
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,470
yeah let's look at what we actually have

157
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:57,510
and if you try to list all these

158
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,260
extensions that are out there on this

159
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,160
official kind of page then you get to

160
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,300
the number of 308 ones that we have and

161
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,750
that should be an interesting sample to

162
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:17,150
to look at so what I did

163
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:21,330
whistled a little downloaded all these

164
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,210
or try to download them all through the

165
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:30,120
website the issue is that you can all

166
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,980
you can either host them on the website

167
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,370
directly or have them on your own and

168
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,830
then link to that but sometimes there

169
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,990
were no links or at least I was too dumb

170
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:45,060
to to find those links so 71 of them I

171
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,490
couldn't find any artifacts to to

172
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,500
download maybe in the way as if he were

173
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,740
here would be here would know where I

174
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,740
went wrong for others I tried hard to to

175
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,530
do find some even went into cases to

176
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:02,370
that abomination and found the stuff

177
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,430
there but long story short the rest of

178
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:09,420
them there was some yes and some kind of

179
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,240
noise around there some some things that

180
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,490
weren't packaged up correctly I guess

181
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,530
it's it's quite hard for somebody who

182
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,560
wants to produce a dictionary for four

183
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,650
LibreOffice to to actually do the final

184
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,560
steps of creating this OHT file there is

185
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,690
some details in there that are difficult

186
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,570
so some people put up other artifacts

187
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:35,130
there only a small percentage so many of

188
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:38,790
our extension authors are great and in

189
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:42,600
having overcome that not small hurdle of

190
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,350
of actually producing such an OST file

191
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:50,699
and of those 228 we may

192
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:53,970
that I downloaded and looked into into

193
00:10:53,970 --> 00:11:02,480
their manifest files the picture is that

194
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:06,600
maybe one of them don't include any code

195
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,040
at all so they are typically their

196
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,610
dictionary or gallery images and what

197
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,649
you need to do there is provide the pure

198
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:19,800
data plus some configuration data that

199
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,569
health Libre offers where are the files

200
00:11:21,569 --> 00:11:25,439
in this extension are like telling Libre

201
00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:27,949
Office that there is a dictionary file

202
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:30,360
contained in that so there's there's

203
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,470
always some some some configuration data

204
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,339
in every extension but many many many of

205
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:40,620
them just contain that and nothing more

206
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,949
if people are happy with that then there

207
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:47,910
were also 81 that just contained basic

208
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,540
code

209
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,180
besides also containing configuration

210
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,490
data typically all of them typically do

211
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:59,730
so anyone just contain basic 28 will

212
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:04,259
Python some kind of letter up in the

213
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:06,350
complexity of these languages probably

214
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,930
22 word Java there were five that your

215
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,759
scripting and in some way most

216
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:13,980
Department again and just four of them

217
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,420
just for were C++ where we have the most

218
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,610
fears of of breaking anything and and

219
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,829
that included even two different

220
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:26,040
versions of the same extension that we

221
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,129
even build bundled with with Libre

222
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:30,600
Office itself and you build it there

223
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,629
that we built the code so that's an easy

224
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:36,779
one to to keep track of and seven of

225
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:38,730
them I don't know what what's in there I

226
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,980
I couldn't find anything so what's

227
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,360
cooking maybe what's broken so that's

228
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,149
quite reassuring for us that

229
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,320
most of them make very little use of the

230
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,880
points that we offer for plug in and the

231
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,730
ones that actually even do like the

232
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,010
basic ones we have that well under

233
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:09,610
control because the basic code is part

234
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,709
of the new office code or the the code

235
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:15,250
to execute basic is ours to control so

236
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,589
if we find out that we break something

237
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:22,120
badly there we could always build and

238
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,170
scaffolding there to to alleviate these

239
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,120
these problems and make them go away

240
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,589
again

241
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:35,230
and ironically the the things that we as

242
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:39,490
developers think about most when we when

243
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:43,360
we think about do we break anything with

244
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,500
an in comfortable change that's the one

245
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,250
that in practice matter the least I

246
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:55,560
don't know if there's beyond those few

247
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,700
that are actually in the in the

248
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,930
extension store if there's a larger

249
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:06,089
corpus of of C++ extensions out

250
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,160
you

251
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,990
don't display late I don't and that's

252
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:26,920
kind of what I wanted to tell you today

253
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:43,190
no no not not exactly I think we may be

254
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:47,900
I mean you still don't want to be three

255
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,990
to four people out there doing the the

256
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:55,160
extensions I'm not sure how much we want

257
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:25,000
to alleviate them but we don't want that

258
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:58,470
what was it sorry I was oh that's

259
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,070
working like a charm

260
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:05,850
no do yeah that's another sure I mean I

261
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,890
was impressed by the actual by the

262
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,890
number of actually working extensions

263
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,740
there because as I said it's it's hard

264
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,410
to do these and all my sympathy to these

265
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,900
people out there who who feel the pain

266
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:23,750
to these Torsten

267
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:35,010
inspection bias in popular so by me so

268
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:38,910
at least I would say looking at the Open

269
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:41,000
Office

270
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:45,260
I know

271
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:43,950
yeah but the problem is always as I said

272
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,230
with their we don't know much about them

273
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,090
we don't hear much about them as long as

274
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,190
they work we don't hear anything

275
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,590
many of them apparently even don't come

276
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,289
to us if things start to break so it's

277
00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:57,450
really difficult for us to draw any

278
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,190
anything from that but there was one

279
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,950
more question over here so I think we're

280
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:15,059
running light so if you can yes there is

281
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:17,309
there's basic it's different in that it

282
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:21,360
has a more direct access but you can

283
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,200
also use by the the you know things from

284
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,909
basic and and the the interoperability

285
00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:29,220
of things although the is it's mostly

286
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,120
about the the the the you know parts so

287
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,480
the rest of this basic runtime is rather

288
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,700
not relevant to this discussion here

289
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:51,290
okay thank you

290
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:57,119
[Applause]
