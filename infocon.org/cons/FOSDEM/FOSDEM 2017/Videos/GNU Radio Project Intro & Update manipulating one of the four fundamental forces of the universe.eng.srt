1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
get going

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,250
so my name is Ben hilburn I run the

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,000
goona radio project and so there's I

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,709
think there's stiphu contortion of the

5
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:15,240
talks in this room Argan radio-based

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,490
which is awesome part of my job

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,710
obviously is project lead is to

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,599
evangelize the project so I'm gonna try

9
00:00:21,599 --> 00:00:23,519
to convince everyone here that should be

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,150
using good radio actually it also is

11
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,609
part of my evangelism duties I did bring

12
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:31,140
a whole bunch of stickers so if you do

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,870
not have a sticker yet please grab one

14
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,820
as a quick survey I'm trying to get a

15
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,130
feel for what the audience is like I

16
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,420
recognize a lot of people here there's a

17
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,070
lot of the core good new Radio

18
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,620
developers and here in the room can you

19
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,670
get a show of hands for people who have

20
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,180
never used green radio before Wow okay

21
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,360
this is awesome all right how about a

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,340
show of hands people who've never used a

23
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,870
software-defined radio before okay all

24
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,850
right that's an interesting mix so I'm

25
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,709
gonna give this is one of the first

26
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,420
talks of the dev room so I'm gonna give

27
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,340
it kind of a brief intro to software

28
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,170
radio a brief intro to the green tea

29
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,390
radio and then it's actually it's not a

30
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,399
very technical talk my goal is to kind

31
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:16,170
of give you an overview some of the cool

32
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,369
stuff that's happening in the community

33
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,259
I'll talk about some of the stuff we're

34
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:22,439
doing and hopefully convince you to get

35
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,119
involved and play with some of the

36
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:25,590
awesome dinner radio applications that

37
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,149
have been made recently so with that I'm

38
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:33,270
gonna get going so real quickly what a

39
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,420
software radio the one of the two of the

40
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,399
most prominent standards professionals

41
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:40,740
bodies in our in our industry are like

42
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,179
Tripoli and the wireless innovation

43
00:01:42,179 --> 00:01:44,159
forum this is the official definition

44
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,319
accepted by everybody in radio in which

45
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:48,270
some or all the physical layer functions

46
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,819
or software-defined what that actually

47
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:54,119
means is instead of sitting at a

48
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,130
breadboard and designing hardware that

49
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,819
does math or you know fabricating a PCB

50
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:02,670
or a CCA that does math you write

51
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,200
software that does math right so you

52
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,479
create programmable radios and you write

53
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,580
software that that defines your your

54
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,760
radio algorithms for you for the record

55
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,769
I consider software radio and

56
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:14,760
software-defined radio to be

57
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,830
interchangeable I've never heard any

58
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,469
definite any

59
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:20,609
definition that distinguish between two

60
00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:23,430
in a way that made sense so good new

61
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,329
radio itself consists of a bunch of

62
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:30,629
tools scheduler runtime and a lot of

63
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:33,349
block IP that lets you create

64
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:35,609
applications that do really really cool

65
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:38,849
stuff and there's a lot of people who

66
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:40,379
are really involved with a project who

67
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:43,099
make really really awesome blocks and

68
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:45,810
it's everything from really basic blocks

69
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,700
like adders signal generators to things

70
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,689
that are extremely complex polyphase

71
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:57,810
filters actually I have some examples up

72
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,359
here OFDM cyclic prefix there's for

73
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:02,120
those of you who are not familiar with

74
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,010
wireless communication standards OFDM

75
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,469
for example is what's used in 802 11 or

76
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:12,859
Wi-Fi LTE not sort of thing and the

77
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,079
variety of blocks that's in the project

78
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:19,290
is is fantastic and it's it's only

79
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,299
extended by all the work that's done in

80
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:22,889
the community and what's called out of

81
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:23,849
tree modules which I'll cover in a

82
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:25,859
second so you train these blocks

83
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:29,040
together and what we call flow graphs so

84
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,690
as an example here this is a very basic

85
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,840
flow graph that's taking rtl-sdr source

86
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,849
which is never seen a little RTL dongle

87
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:38,879
like $20 global receivers passes it

88
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,319
through a basic flow graph and dumps it

89
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,530
to the audio so this is actually a very

90
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,720
basic FM receiver that you can make with

91
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,430
your new radio so my high-level pitch

92
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,340
for going radio is you can do basically

93
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,919
anything you want the software radio you

94
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,299
can you don't have to use hardware

95
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,639
you don't need hardware to use it you

96
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,919
can do simulation you can do hardware

97
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,090
and LU prototyping as you're building

98
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,189
stuff up and then in the end you can

99
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:06,599
actually put it out and deploy it

100
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:10,530
whether that's using attaching a radio

101
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,389
like this little one I have here to your

102
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:14,220
pc or actually sticking it on an

103
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,409
embedded device and there's a

104
00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:18,449
significant still get chunk of the

105
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:20,608
community who actually uses green radio

106
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:24,690
on embedded devices so with that I'm

107
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,000
gonna actually go edit free modules so

108
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,200
the one thing I really want to point out

109
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,580
before I start jumping into specific

110
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,200
applications

111
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,610
we had this concept of a totry modules

112
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,340
in vinny radio we try to keep the the

113
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,310
primary distribution as clean as

114
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,210
possible and that means that every new

115
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,290
application that comes out if we try to

116
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,880
pull in all everything that's being done

117
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,040
with every new wireless standard the

118
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,120
green radio distribution would just

119
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,120
explode right so every time somebody

120
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,170
wrote a new version of 802 11 standard

121
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,720
or a new cellular standard or a new

122
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,430
module to track airplanes or a new

123
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,190
module to track ships you know a new

124
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,430
satellite communication standard the

125
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,650
Grenadier would get very very big so we

126
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,780
had this concept of a decree modules as

127
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,240
people create these they post them on

128
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,430
github and then they show up here on C

129
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,550
grande so C grant is our sort of our

130
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,120
version of the pearls archive network so

131
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,860
it stands for the green radio are the

132
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,850
comprehensive gonna radio archive

133
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,670
network if you go to see grande org this

134
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,440
is the website you'll find it's actually

135
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,500
auto populated from what's called pi

136
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,070
bombs and PI bombs is our out of treat

137
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,990
or it's a it's a package maintenance

138
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,850
system effectively so you don't have to

139
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,230
use PI bombs install gated radio if

140
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,080
you're on any of the major Linux

141
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,000
distributions you can apt-get install

142
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,280
kinney radio or DNF install canny radio

143
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,020
if you're interested in using out a tree

144
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,510
modules PI bonds is a great way to do it

145
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,130
or you can build it yourself and there's

146
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:58,210
a lot of really really great stuff

147
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,460
already in here I already gave a few

148
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:06,010
examples that's interesting so if you've

149
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,890
seen any of like the big applications

150
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,700
that made a lot of the tech news like

151
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,970
tracking tracking error traffic mapping

152
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,880
ships in real time over Google Maps all

153
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,530
that kind of stuff all of that code

154
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,720
those applications are here on Sea Grant

155
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,330
so you can just go grab those connect

156
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:30,730
your SDR and do really cool stuff I do

157
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,890
want to talk about G sock in focus real

158
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:36,310
quickly we participated in G sock for in

159
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,470
for four years for the last five and

160
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,320
done focus for last to some really

161
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,970
really awesome stuff has come out of

162
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,860
these programs and

163
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,869
I generally considered this to be very

164
00:06:46,869 --> 00:06:49,149
successful for the project and actually

165
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:51,009
one of the presentations later today is

166
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:53,529
from Sebastian Muller who is a one of

167
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:54,699
the successful g-shock students from

168
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:57,399
last year if you're interested in

169
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,539
working on getting ready and would like

170
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:00,699
some funding these are great ways to do

171
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:04,360
it we will be doing both or applying for

172
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,550
both Qi Salk and focus this year Martyn

173
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,559
Branagh is our community manager and

174
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:11,499
he's leading this effort for those of

175
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:12,519
you who aren't familiar the way JSOC

176
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,979
works you we put together an ideas list

177
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:16,119
and we submit it to Google and Google

178
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:18,339
says yes they sound good or no they

179
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:19,329
don't

180
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:21,399
we've had pretty good luck and getting

181
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,889
accepted and we have a lot of really

182
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:27,399
cool ideas for this year on the general

183
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:30,159
side it's it's everything from C++ code

184
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:34,059
generation Android wor QT graphics DSP

185
00:07:34,059 --> 00:07:36,639
stuff security stuff and this kind of

186
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,249
touches on one of the major topics that

187
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:40,769
I want to talk about which is that

188
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:43,659
software-defined radio as a field I

189
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:46,119
think is extremely interesting because

190
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:51,329
it's it's very to use a corporate

191
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:54,699
buzzword it's very cross domain right

192
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:56,319
just about everything you can think of

193
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,039
in terms of Thank You Philip it's not

194
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:01,929
everything you can think of applies to

195
00:08:01,929 --> 00:08:04,629
software radio whether it's you know

196
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:10,479
kernel level OS implementation details

197
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,619
if it's networking it's DSP or FPGAs

198
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:17,739
embedded graphics work pretty much every

199
00:08:17,739 --> 00:08:19,749
technical area somehow relates to

200
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,129
generate or somehow it's a software

201
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:24,309
radio and thus to goony radio so even if

202
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:25,719
you're just getting started here you're

203
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:27,909
not you know you can't you couldn't

204
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:30,399
build a LTE modem to receive cellular

205
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:32,229
traffic that's fine you don't have to

206
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:34,058
you don't have to be a DSP expert you

207
00:08:34,058 --> 00:08:37,000
don't have to be a wireless expert you

208
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,948
can contribute at pretty much any level

209
00:08:38,948 --> 00:08:40,120
and there's lots and lots of ways to get

210
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:45,250
involved okay so the good radio

211
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,149
conference we've we've had six very

212
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:52,240
successful years last year gr con 16 was

213
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,819
awesome we had 304 and 10 days and 20

214
00:08:54,819 --> 00:08:57,130
sponsors it was hosted at the University

215
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,260
of Colorado Boulder

216
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,030
we typically do a full week four days of

217
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:05,080
talks one day of a hack fest and last

218
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,460
year was our first year doing a hacking

219
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,100
challenge which Bastille did which was

220
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,250
actually really cool this is my plug for

221
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,330
it we're in the throes of finalizing San

222
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,220
Diego for this year so it will be in

223
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,130
mid-september in San Diego California

224
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,260
we'll have our call for papers and talks

225
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,020
out pretty shortly so please plan to

226
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,630
come if you're interested and then much

227
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,580
like everything else it's on all levels

228
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,290
if you've never used a software radio

229
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,210
before it'll be useful and interesting

230
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,880
you can come ask us questions and if you

231
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,280
are implementing satellite modems you

232
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,420
can come work with other people that are

233
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,960
implementing satellite modems one of the

234
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,280
major things that we did for going radio

235
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,400
last year is we created a foundation so

236
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,740
the radios got to the point where there

237
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,220
is significant investment happening in

238
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,680
lots of different areas industry

239
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,870
government academics hobbyists and we

240
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:05,470
needed a way to focus this so the

241
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,790
Foundation's current responsibilities

242
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,950
are raising money to support the project

243
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,150
we've gotten to the point now where we

244
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:13,000
have significant project costs that

245
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,550
includes a very significant AWS

246
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,640
infrastructure for our CI systems and

247
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,730
web systems managing the finances we

248
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,190
actually have a not insignificant amount

249
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,900
of IP now that the Free Software

250
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,630
Foundation does not hold for us so the

251
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,330
Guardian Dacian holds that and putting

252
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,780
on gr con which is at this point a very

253
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:38,310
expensive event yes

254
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,050
the FSF holds all of the FSF holds a

255
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,320
copyright to all of our code and that is

256
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,839
what they protect but the Grenadier as a

257
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,779
project now has lots of IP that is not

258
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:59,790
just code the logo is the most this is

259
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:04,470
the most basic example right this is the

260
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,769
most basic example more complex examples

261
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:10,320
would be all of the code that is in our

262
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,029
web back-end forget future

263
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:16,410
responsibilities is funding project

264
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,399
development so and I think we're going

265
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,110
to touch on this in the panel shortly so

266
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,240
I maybe a little bit based on the panel

267
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,800
description so I don't want to go into

268
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,079
too much detail there but we've reached

269
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,690
the point where you know a lot of the

270
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,100
really really interesting work is

271
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,930
happening in the outer tree modules

272
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:39,779
right and we need a way to fund

273
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:42,899
development of the project core to keep

274
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:44,910
everything moving there and the best way

275
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,449
to do that is to pay people so funding

276
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:50,220
funding development within the project

277
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,459
is one of the one of the goals there

278
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:54,420
just to cover some of the awesome stuff

279
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,010
that's happened recently and I actually

280
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,120
talked about this one that gr con a

281
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,070
little bit all the other ones are mostly

282
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,199
new so for June tech recently ran an

283
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:02,339
experiment where they had they put an

284
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:03,630
embedded system and a sounding rocket

285
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,579
this is a picture of the rocket taking

286
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:10,860
off from a NASA center and then they had

287
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,300
a software radio connected to the ground

288
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,160
station this is the antenna array and

289
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,110
actually had goona radio running at the

290
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:20,100
ground station and in the rocket and so

291
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,350
greater was their comms link for the

292
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,269
rocket that they launched and they

293
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:26,279
maintain the link throughout the course

294
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,380
of the event and gathered experimental

295
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,029
data which is really awesome

296
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:33,390
unfortunately NASA lost the rocket it

297
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,800
landed somewhere in the ocean and they

298
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,510
never recovered it but they did get

299
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:41,550
useful data before it disappeared this

300
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,980
one is actually really cool so can you

301
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,269
show of hands people who know about

302
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:50,370
Outernet okay so not I'll give you a

303
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,300
brief background so Outernet is actually

304
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:54,990
I can't remember

305
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:55,950
it's also the name of the company

306
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,020
Outernet is a project to try to provide

307
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,740
Internet to the world right it's like

308
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,080
Facebook's internet.org and Google's

309
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,390
Project loon the goal is to provide

310
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,860
Internet to the world through satellites

311
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,490
and their eventual goal is to do this

312
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,490
through cube SATs so cube SATs are one

313
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,930
of the areas that the green radio is

314
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,130
getting used more and more heavily which

315
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,440
is really cool right now Outernet does

316
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,170
not have its own satellites so it's

317
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:25,440
using mr sat low Earth orbit satellites

318
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,000
that are already there

319
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,339
to broadcast broadcast this is that this

320
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:33,510
is where they they kind of got in

321
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:33,839
trouble

322
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,209
their original tagline we will provide

323
00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:37,500
Internet to everybody and what it

324
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,580
actually turns out is they will provide

325
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,740
access to very specific websites at

326
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,810
certain times so they would provide

327
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,860
access for example to amazon.com or

328
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,910
certain certain parts of Wikipedia and

329
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:53,459
one other major sales pitches early on

330
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:56,790
also was that everything is gonna be

331
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:00,360
open and you could build a receiver they

332
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,190
would release the specifications for

333
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,260
receiver and they encourage everyone to

334
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,329
build a receiver and then share how you

335
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:09,120
built it as it turns out what's actually

336
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,390
open is the hardware and the actual

337
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,420
receiver software codecs are all closed

338
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,079
source but that's okay because we have

339
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:25,520
been radio and so this really awesome

340
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,990
work that was done here it's all the

341
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,520
complete walkthrough is on the green

342
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,800
radio blog now reverse engineering the

343
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,140
satellite link and it takes you from

344
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,890
okay I see the satellite signal you do

345
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,180
this with something as basic as these

346
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:43,200
you know a little SDR right to decoding

347
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,820
it in Guinea radio this is a good in

348
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,250
radio graphical sync and seeing the

349
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,380
webpages what they're broadcasting right

350
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,880
and so there's a complete walkthrough on

351
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,160
the green radio blog this is a neat

352
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,880
example this so I had this example here

353
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,800
this was from Mike Osman this is

354
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,839
actually a couple years old but I have

355
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:02,279
it here because I want to use this as

356
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,440
kind of a launching pad is this was

357
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,380
first presented at the gr con 14 he

358
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,030
subsequently presented it

359
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,880
Khanh one of the areas that we've seen

360
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,200
the radio to start really start to take

361
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,660
off is in the cybersecurity community so

362
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,540
you know for a long time the

363
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,020
cybersecurity world really focused on

364
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,760
link layer and above right they assumed

365
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,610
that they were getting bits it's like

366
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,530
you give me a black box of bits and I'll

367
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,910
figure out how to reverse engineer it or

368
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,730
hack it or whatever but the actual comms

369
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,430
link itself was always just assumed to

370
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,130
be there and one of the real interests

371
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,000
the things that we're starting to see

372
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,990
with the inner radio is the

373
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,180
cybersecurity music community's adopting

374
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,950
it and starting to do really really cool

375
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:48,750
stuff at the layer below so this is one

376
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,990
of the first examples that really it's

377
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:55,310
kind of edgy it got a lot of attention

378
00:15:55,310 --> 00:16:00,360
Mike Osmond basically took something

379
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,550
that was leaked by Snowden as part of

380
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,080
the NSA what do you call the NSA playset

381
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,530
and implemented it in Guinea radio and

382
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:14,030
what it was was the ability to sniff

383
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:17,700
signals traveling over VGA cord with a

384
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,650
software radio and then see it on your

385
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:23,010
computer and so what you see here is his

386
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,650
his radio setup so this is a hack RF is

387
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,350
his basic little cheap software radio I

388
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,150
don't mean cheap is in poor quality I

389
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,380
mean cheap is and these are relatively

390
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,110
affordable just to be clear is this his

391
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,180
radio setup and this is the output of

392
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,400
his goona radio flow graph which as you

393
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,650
can see is him booting into on a machine

394
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,630
through you know looking looking at a

395
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:45,870
VGA cable so since then so that was in

396
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:49,020
gr con 14 we now have you know three

397
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,400
years of lots of interesting

398
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,640
cybersecurity work and it's not just

399
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,740
reverse engineering stuff in some cases

400
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,330
is actually resurrecting stuff so at

401
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,920
shmoocon just last month as an example

402
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,440
Brandon Creighton recreated the amp

403
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,680
cellular network can I get a show of

404
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,740
hands people who know what amps is okay

405
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,869
so amp stands for the advanced mobile

406
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:15,030
phone system it was one of the first

407
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,829
cellular networks deployed in the United

408
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:19,020
States and that's what you used if you

409
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,200
had one of these I should have had like

410
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,859
a

411
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:24,569
a size reference here and this is like

412
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:27,240
the size of your head right it's huge

413
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,200
but he rebuilt the amps spec in goo

414
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,809
radio and if you have a software radio

415
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:36,030
you can now as it had a true module you

416
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:39,330
can go grab gr amps and run an amp space

417
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:44,990
station Android is an area that we're

418
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,010
that's actually really exciting I you

419
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,840
might have seen it on my slide 4G stock

420
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,370
if you're interested in Android work

421
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,840
please come talk to us because we really

422
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,549
like to get some people working on this

423
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:59,250
over the summer especially so a lot of

424
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,660
the early work is actually done by my

425
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,179
predecessor Tom these are images I

426
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:07,500
shamelessly stole from your blog so in

427
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,669
this example you can actually see this

428
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:10,590
is a software radio that's connected by

429
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,160
USB to an Android phone that's running

430
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:18,140
and increasing what we're seeing are

431
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,330
mobile handsets that would allow you to

432
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,580
actually use Hardware within the phone

433
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,230
so you wouldn't actually have to cable a

434
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,240
software radio to you could use your

435
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,950
phone's software radios instead of

436
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:32,220
having to cable one yourself to it so an

437
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,320
example of this is the new Motorola I

438
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,330
think it's the Moto Z or you can have

439
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:39,000
you have like arbitrary Hardware packs

440
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,220
you stick onto the back of it and you

441
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,200
have what's effectively either a USB or

442
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,980
a PCIe connection to your hardware so I

443
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,630
mean you've effectively could carry

444
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,850
around a good radio programmable

445
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:54,419
software radio in your phone which is

446
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:55,980
simultaneously very exciting and

447
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,290
probably probably very terrifying for

448
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:02,070
anyone and InfoSec this was one that was

449
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:07,200
that was demonstrated at gr con 16 it's

450
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,750
worth watching the video if you have any

451
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,179
time you actually like my slides are all

452
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:14,730
uploaded all my slides I tried to put

453
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,960
links everywhere in the slides in case

454
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,850
you want download him look at him

455
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,640
so using gonna radio actually Alexander

456
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,150
are you in the room no yeah I think he's

457
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:26,190
standing outside so Alexander and his

458
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:30,720
team at Fair waves hijacked drones using

459
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,240
goona radio and so this is a picture gr

460
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,419
con this last year of an Alexander is

461
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:36,840
like Stan

462
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,649
right here he's holding a PlayStation

463
00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:42,240
controller and is controlling this drone

464
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,249
and the PlayStation controllers input is

465
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,440
going to Guinea radio and then it's and

466
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,299
he's dejected it into the control stream

467
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:50,340
of the drones wireless comms he

468
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,749
subsequently flies it into the ceiling

469
00:19:51,749 --> 00:19:55,110
and it crashes but it's really cool

470
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:58,350
again this is it this is that laster's

471
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,610
gr car and you can get the slides you

472
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:03,809
can see the video is all open source

473
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:06,210
another area one talk about is Radio

474
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:11,309
Astronomy so to me Radio Astronomy is

475
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:15,059
super awesome these radio waves all

476
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:16,529
around us right so the ability to

477
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:18,360
actually use radio waves to study the

478
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,429
cosmos I think is it's fascinating and

479
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:25,919
so these are examples of huge radio

480
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:26,850
astronomy dishes right so this is

481
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,429
Arecibo these dishes are kilometers wide

482
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:33,600
it's absolutely huge and these these

483
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,759
images all from you ha Vernon's

484
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:39,299
presentation at gr con but what we're

485
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:41,220
seeing is actually Guinea Radio getting

486
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,889
picked up and used very broadly in radio

487
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:46,529
astronomy which is really really cool to

488
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:47,460
me

489
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,639
so you hover and actually who's that the

490
00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:53,249
haystack Observatory mate if I had a

491
00:20:53,249 --> 00:20:54,450
presentation on gr kind about some of

492
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:58,679
his work and you guys unbelievably

493
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:00,659
brilliant is actually the mind blowing

494
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,749
like using the RTL dongles that I

495
00:21:03,749 --> 00:21:05,220
mentioned you like map the surface of

496
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,200
the moon with radio waves and those

497
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,999
things the resolution on those things is

498
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:11,159
horrible so it's he does incredible work

499
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:17,639
but recent more recently at so the NRO

500
00:21:17,639 --> 00:21:19,679
which is a national radios front

501
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,720
radioastron Observatory United States

502
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,210
and started integrating the radio into

503
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,499
not only their own work but their

504
00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:28,230
curriculum and there's now a separate

505
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,730
project called the open source radio

506
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,610
telescope project and their goal is to

507
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,440
create a community for people who want

508
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,929
to build your own Radio Astronomy

509
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:40,379
telescopes at home cheaply you don't

510
00:21:40,379 --> 00:21:43,639
need something like an Arecibo dish to

511
00:21:43,639 --> 00:21:46,110
receive radio waves from other galaxies

512
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,090
and study them you can actually do that

513
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,590
relatively cheaply at home

514
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,170
so the open-source radio telescope

515
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:55,600
project is a they just kicked us off if

516
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,740
you go to the website you'll notice it's

517
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,360
still somewhat under construction

518
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,060
the idea is to post designs schematics

519
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,480
tips can you radio flow graphs to help

520
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,490
you get into this kind of thing other

521
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,780
thing i want to i want to mention here

522
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:11,050
is the sea sarah program so anybody

523
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,570
who's actually been on the radio

524
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,190
discussed mailing lists you've probably

525
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,620
seen the name marcus leech he's one of

526
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,970
the most active people in our community

527
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,760
he used to work at s brac which is a was

528
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,190
a Canadian radio astronomy group this is

529
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:29,860
a satellite or not his yet but there so

530
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,570
here's this they're running this project

531
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:33,070
see Sarah and their goal is actually to

532
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:37,420
make dishes like this broadly available

533
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,360
to everybody so that you could just up

534
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,710
you know upload you're getting radio

535
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,080
flow graph say stick it on this dish and

536
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,270
get access to those kinds of resources

537
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,490
so if you interested in this this is all

538
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:50,380
happening in the open source world and

539
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:54,910
it's gonna be awesome actually mean two

540
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,040
minutes until questions right yeah so

541
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,030
the last thing I really wanna talk about

542
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,130
here is the signal metadata format which

543
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:07,480
is what Tom mentioned so at this at a

544
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,220
high level it doesn't sound like an

545
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,350
especially sexy problem to try and solve

546
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:14,590
but it's actually incredibly important

547
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:17,260
so this is something we've just kicked

548
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,830
off and my my pitch to you is if this is

549
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,900
something that you think you might be

550
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,580
interested in please please come get

551
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,140
involved with us this is much bigger

552
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:30,070
than just gonna radio and I really like

553
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,620
for everyone who might be interested to

554
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,690
come give us feedback so the goal is and

555
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,550
we record samples you end up with these

556
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,470
huge data sets right gigabytes or

557
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,990
terabytes in size and it's very

558
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,990
difficult to make those datasets useful

559
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,000
to anyone else right there's an

560
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,560
incredible amount of information that

561
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,080
you need in order to make use of these

562
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,360
kinds of things and it's you know basic

563
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,610
stuff like I recorded it at you know

564
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:57,040
this latitude longitude assuming that's

565
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,560
a static variable the static field this

566
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,170
is the Creator this is the date - things

567
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,670
like this was the sample rate this was

568
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,090
my Center

569
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,470
frequency this is how I filter the

570
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:07,779
signal this was my overt this is how I

571
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:11,559
scaled the samples down to annotations

572
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:15,100
like hey I was running an automatic

573
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,080
modulation classifier and I detected

574
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,539
BPSK starting at this sample at this

575
00:24:19,539 --> 00:24:21,940
frequency too even basic stuff like you

576
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,279
know the cat jumped on the antenna and

577
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:25,600
messed up my signal at this point I

578
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,820
fixed it starting at this sample all

579
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,140
that kind of stuff is really really

580
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:33,490
important and it's important for lots of

581
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,919
reasons especially as the two major ones

582
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,240
want to point out here are scientific

583
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,980
rigor right the ability to reproduce

584
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,799
other people's work we're really big on

585
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:44,470
you know publishing code and making

586
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:47,260
datasets available and making datasets

587
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,210
available it doesn't mean anything if

588
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:50,350
nobody else can actually use your

589
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:53,350
dataset and the other piece of it is

590
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,789
right now there's no way to

591
00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:56,620
collaboratively work on radio signals

592
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,080
right if you have a giant data set let's

593
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,299
say of a signal you measured you you

594
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:02,710
gathered from another galaxy there's no

595
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,690
way to annotate that and share it with

596
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:05,980
everybody else and say hey take a look

597
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,630
and add your own as the annotations

598
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,100
that's what we're trying to do was to

599
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,870
game F so sickening that stands for

600
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:15,070
signal metadata format the spec is the

601
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:18,570
spec is very much a work in progress

602
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,880
which you can currently find on the

603
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,390
greedy well I'm struggling with the

604
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:31,600
resolution alright well if you go to the

605
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,880
good radio github you'll find the sig MF

606
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,929
yeah that's not terribly readable

607
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:39,460
anyways you'll find the Signum F

608
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,860
repository have a look at the spec it's

609
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,419
not at the point yet where you should

610
00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:45,669
edit it and be like this comma makes

611
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,799
this sentence confusing it's at the

612
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:49,600
point where if you it would be great if

613
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,399
you went and read it and said hey I have

614
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:53,500
this particular use case I'm developing

615
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,059
this modem and I want to be able to take

616
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:57,490
a dataset from gray radio to a spat to a

617
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:00,610
static offline tool like in spectrum and

618
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:03,159
I think you lack the ability to do this

619
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:05,020
it would be great if you know you

620
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:08,169
supported this so please have a look

621
00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:12,250
give us some feedback and let us know so

622
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,620
with that I have five minutes left in

623
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,630
the slot so Martin I'll give it back to

624
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:19,409
you for questions

625
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,520
yeah so that's a really interesting

626
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,870
point and it it is the thing that's

627
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:51,640
unique about what we're trying to do

628
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,390
with sig MF is it's you know you notice

629
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,039
it we chose the word signal very

630
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,159
specifically so what we tried to do is

631
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,020
everything else that we've seen doesn't

632
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,980
allow you to describe features of analog

633
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,710
or digital signals uniquely and that's

634
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,029
the specific problem that we're trying

635
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:10,779
to solve

636
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:13,419
so like the particles then this would

637
00:27:13,419 --> 00:27:16,149
not be useful for and doesn't replicate

638
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:17,350
anything it's been done at the particle

639
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:22,020
level for example but wave equations yes

640
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,380
sorry

641
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:45,979
is the is there a document is there a

642
00:27:45,979 --> 00:27:49,340
book for Guinea radio there is not a

643
00:27:49,340 --> 00:28:11,149
formal textbook for radio know ya know

644
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:20,179
so it yeah so I well you're saying yeah

645
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:28,580
okay so yes I agree and there have been

646
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,960
a number of discussions about trying to

647
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,839
write a textbook obviously writing a

648
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:34,509
textbook is a tremendous amount of work

649
00:28:34,509 --> 00:28:37,249
so right now what we're really trying to

650
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:38,659
push in terms of documentation efforts

651
00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:40,580
is just getting more documentation at

652
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:43,129
the project level so that users who want

653
00:28:43,129 --> 00:28:44,539
to come and get involved and start doing

654
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:46,339
something have what they need to get

655
00:28:46,339 --> 00:28:51,019
started I would be if you're interested

656
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:53,389
in and talking about how we might get

657
00:28:53,389 --> 00:28:57,969
something like a textbook like a what I

658
00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:01,969
like an O'Reilly book I agree that would

659
00:29:01,969 --> 00:29:02,629
be awesome

660
00:29:02,629 --> 00:29:04,070
I don't know how to make that happen I

661
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:05,539
think that's a good like the fact that

662
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:07,900
they always I liked it

663
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:16,419
