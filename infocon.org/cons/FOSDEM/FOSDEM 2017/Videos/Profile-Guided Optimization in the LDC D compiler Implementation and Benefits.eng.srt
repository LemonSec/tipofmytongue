hello des senator at my name sky one of sie maintainer soft cell bc compiler

2
00:00:15,209 --> 00:00:23,549
 today i'm talking about sie dresses optimization with your sweet susie

3
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:35,100
 completely on 14 6 plate optimization

4
00:00:35,730 --> 00:01:01,559
 because the information analysis is horrified star rides a bike work and

5
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:10,689
 service came the terminal racing as from looking at six should all way to get

6
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:19,029
 Information before optimization is just look at the patients and information

7
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:32,470
 from other applications manager recognize samples applications topsy application

8
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:39,908
 ind sonnemanns of time location and sources said one way to do it but that's

9
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:45,270
 not an green logistics is a

10
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,939
 instrumentation opsource relocated

11
00:01:51,960 --> 00:02:04,559
 how heavy samples zenit st instrumentation and stuff so before

12
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,140
 optimistic information wants to know

13
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,429
 the function colt

14
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:23,740
 open it is positive open the industry is still open is not taken as

15
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:29,800
 simple knowledge victim examples, county openly briefly recognize the functional they

16
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:37,320
 found studio city pendant on foot so have to the lord of counter strike source and

17
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:44,040
 collect ossis data application a correct data so you want it

18
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:53,649
 hartz-iv-receiver have something huge piccolo profi application that is too

19
00:02:53,650 --> 00:03:03,700
 so you drobek like hansi flick ation to create you information as well as quality

20
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:12,730
 on the information like the reiff depends on the application

21
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:19,899
 average input recognizes expect last are well coiffed know exceptional

22
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:26,740
 input solo class specific cases anna gette profile is the word cover

23
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:33,460
 everything and ascend from result in moth optimization what in the

24
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:42,240
 performance los ticos one pointing you optimally from places to optimize

25
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:52,690
 [Music] information optimization but you have to

26
00:03:52,690 --> 00:04:12,100
 be careful what they is you have to justice action network so the guilt around

27

 competent support for it's okay that is what the for the people who did not wanted

30
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,910
 heard about it die boss created it means something in the program in language

31
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:05,960
 in 2000 when it's the first time and what we meant to be still hard-working

32
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:14,310

35
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:42,210
 come in c ++ eissing extender in the two how good you are good points of the

36
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:51,388
 language of support managements as well as booklet polymorphism you can do the object

37
00:05:51,389 --> 00:05:57,599

38
00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:04,259
 have three weeks and a lot of others part of an integrated switch to this

39
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:24,680
 time this time you can get up and work together from templates template program

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,889
 master did you can't you switch template is selective base and

41
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:35,910
 conditions let's make it very easy to use template meta programming and it's

42
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:44,310
 what i heard a fence favorite place of the very nice usage collector that is

43
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:53,370

55
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:27,549
 the first die comes from the fact they front and is now in the middle of the cfm

 something that you indirectly function core promotion you now dress simplex

00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:57,520
 is the herb is the most likely court function okay like have to be one

 [Music]

147
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:40,930
 until optimization continues the motto helping you know about with function

148
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:44,610
 let's go then you can do it yourself

 they don't know anything and so the fine and template will be heizcheck for the most

150
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:04,990
 likely function and sarkozy like i function uci function points all

151
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:16,630
 sunday is larry special features lowers the body it now has the

152
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:26,440
 fashion point and replace is likely template most likely function as every

153
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:33,700
 single out other template we could use is afx basf in video and

154
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:54,390
 compliance support of malt scotch minute per game tasting function as millions

155
00:25:54,390 --> 00:26:08,830
 of places like function last the compiler solberg okay let's go down to

156
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:23,139
 sea ​​level so just how is represented in direct call ece level is as simple as

157
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:29,460
 load the value of the pointer as well as mr 46

158
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:42,690
 very simple not value and jump

159
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:52,979
 okay because it will be the next fall the instruments throw instruments

160
00:26:52,980 --> 00:27:07,440
 virgil is step we have to the counter for functional whether he would have with a little

161
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:17,120
 counter open is the magnifying glass news of the friend like from need to record witsch

162
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:26,299
 target like you call response and of course i loading and calling the

163
00:27:26,299 --> 00:27:34,500
 function is so present had put lot of stuff around it because we were at it

164
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:42,870
 instruments application general profile data solutions ag meant to sell list of

165
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:52,080
 data and look at generated content for example news and function as one counter

 instrument in sthashausen team sets what would expect in one for mornings

167
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:19,639
 the function and one for the function disco view on your profile like just die

168
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:34,710
 profile data to optimization and the optimist pointer die helfer compared

169
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:43,549
 with most likely franken die az i function and plans and grungy

170
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:55,370
 original in direct call steve antin them all case because like jump over and

171
00:28:55,370 --> 00:29:01,949
 function was very simple social research where it was in nonnweiler wm and so in sophie

172
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:09,600
 instruction as you okay for can of you past the uci value fund so island

173
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:19,770
 most likely case the jump the talent set wolfgang hfjs profile data is

174
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:29,879
 ashton you metadata at a world cup anyway, for the seed on sweet johann

 classics with jesus v table structure to be virtual core and businesses to

182
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:38,540
 replace the virtual starek call and set very interesting autosport com

183

 now I am corrected as well as two far-shot proschwitz source code

189
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:30,060
 instrumentation sentences like simply red one developed

190
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:28,040
 now okay so sequel esther she is instrumenting for Tauss just before
