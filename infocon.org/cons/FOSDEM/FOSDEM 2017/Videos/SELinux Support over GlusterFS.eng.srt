1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,179
No

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,219
my sex different Tony Thornton and I am

3
00:00:09,219 --> 00:00:12,280
currently software engineer at that so I

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,539
am part of NFS team in a Dutch College

5
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:17,680
but today I am talking about a different

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,939
topic s Linux support our glass surface

7
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,869
so before moving to my talk I would like

8
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:29,099
to take this opportunity to thank

9
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,729
following people for their work to

10
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,980
towards this project Brian Foster Neil

11
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:42,340
Davis and manikandan so today I will go

12
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,260
through the following sections of

13
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,420
following slides so I will start with

14
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,340
what this last row first then I will

15
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,859
talk about a silliness in Gloucester

16
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:53,109
offers then the challenges or issues

17
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:55,359
which we faced while implementing the

18
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,809
'selenic support and how the clients can

19
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:06,580
do the stuff and and where are we so so

20
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,820
what is cluster office like this slide

21
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,240
might be you hear this see this slide

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,900
before so so if Smalling or something

23
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,580
like that so basically

24
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,740
Gloucester offices in open source scalar

25
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,380
distributed file system which is posting

26
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,960
swampland and it's a software-defined

27
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,780
storage and it works in the use of space

28
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,220
and it aggregates storage different

29
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,280
shows units into a single namespace in

30
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,380
Gloucester things we call teaser volume

31
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,670
and one of the important feature or like

32
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,130
key highlight of cross-purposes it does

33
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,520
not have a dedicated metadata server and

34
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,820
it provides all the overall cluster

35
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,650
first be same provides a stackable

36
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:57,160
modular architecture and it can unknown

37
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,410
any commodity hardware like our laptop

38
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:03,580
source like the short mapper and

39
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,010
[Music]

40
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,310
so these are the following components in

41
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,250
glass surface so the basically that this

42
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,530
should support extended attribute like

43
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,260
est 4 X of s that's the only requirement

44
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,160
for this to be part of cluster first

45
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,710
storage then it has following components

46
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:27,000
so there are servers which we know we

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,850
say it's named ostrich bricks or it's a

48
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,830
Gloucester facility daemon running on

49
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,980
these storage bricks and it experts say

50
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,210
a local file system and at the client we

51
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,000
aggregate different storage units to a

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,180
single point which we called Sno s mo

53
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,040
Liam and we have different stackable

54
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,350
modules inside clients which we call

55
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,140
translators and there's a management

56
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,690
daemon which in which we can manage

57
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,690
volumes or add nodes to the cluster or

58
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,180
add peers of envious of all in size and

59
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,520
set different options for a volume Citra

60
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,340
and this is done with the help of stay

61
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,560
alert or flying in the face tool and

62
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,560
this is how the our cluster for

63
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,270
architecture will look like so the

64
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:30,840
storage admin can create a glass surface

65
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,959
volume using bricks the physical price

66
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,820
and it will export each physical drives

67
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,170
fire books and admit you a volume and

68
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:46,350
user can mount or use that volume using

69
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,720
different protocols like NFS or scripts

70
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,620
or shoes or purse text like that and if

71
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,800
you look into the internal architecture

72
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,800
like you can see two diagrams left side

73
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,870
is server and right side is client so

74
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,670
each of them we call it stands letters

75
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,890
each them up pluggable modules like me

76
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,070
in which you can include each feature

77
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,010
and remote if you want so

78
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,320
client will question it will go through

79
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,810
like these are deferred translators will

80
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,670
be low order that the client said at the

81
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,830
right side the blue-collar all of the

82
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,440
Chris will go through this turns latest

83
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,320
and it's sent to the server and so in so

84
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,910
also we can see different translators

85
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,620
all requests will go through this

86
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,830
translators and at track at last shift

87
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,750
we will write just write into the POSIX

88
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:45,480
layer so before moving to Ness topics do

89
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,820
we have any doubts or questions

90
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,590
regarding Buster office or executor or

91
00:04:49,590 --> 00:05:05,760
something like that okay now I will talk

92
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,310
about SELinux in blast-rifles like so I

93
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,050
will just here briefing verb or s

94
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,760
silliness and like I am NOT an expert in

95
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:19,950
s in Linux so this is just a brief intro

96
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,800
which have few terms like so it provides

97
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,140
a mandatory access control for linux

98
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:29,250
systems excellence can work on policies

99
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,730
like it enforce rules based on policies

100
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:36,060
and each processes and files are liable

101
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:42,990
with Kondos like this you can see LS - -

102
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,090
you said if I give the first one is the

103
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:48,900
DAC the durational access Condors the

104
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,210
wave write permissions user group then

105
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:54,960
you can see the excellence one so it has

106
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,090
four parts question is to you sir second

107
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,780
one is words third one is type and last

108
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,090
one is security level so you say is

109
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:06,320
similar to the Linux user you can map

110
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,870
Linux use and s unis users using Exynos

111
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,940
policies and then they subject so object

112
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:20,100
words like it's kind of domain for the

113
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,620
use of silic what on the user can access

114
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,530
or something like that and nest and

115
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,139
percent type of that file of process

116
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:32,229
so each domain can access different

117
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:36,460
types of files or processes based on the

118
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,889
asinus policies and last one is the

119
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:44,050
security level and what which I'm method

120
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,919
is smart if sicilians for the backend so

121
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:48,699
excellency says just a nice

122
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,310
interactivity named with security

123
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,770
silliness and it stores following thing

124
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:59,669
with this attribute so thank you

125
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:04,240
and what surface initially next so glass

126
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,129
surface is a application which works

127
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:09,310
well with nasty Linux games like it has

128
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:12,159
the running all the running process

129
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:15,340
really have following excellence contest

130
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:19,150
and system user system it means that

131
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,159
it's run by assistant Lee that's how it

132
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:23,949
gets system you and system Alice user

133
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:27,039
and or and blaster D - B is the type

134
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,779
further all the process to select it may

135
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:30,639
be booth process or client process or

136
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,439
the management daemon which I talked

137
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:35,710
about so by default they we don't need

138
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,560
yet or like you get following contest

139
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,270
and below I listed the files which the

140
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,029
surface process can access so you can

141
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:52,779
see the roles for a type for each file

142
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:55,960
so each of which represents plaster day

143
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,360
in which so the glass surface process of

144
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,330
blaster processes can access those files

145
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,360
and one thing to be noted that let brick

146
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,599
like fix will be a path in a Linux

147
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,240
system each following contest with

148
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,030
velocity brick so and

149
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,360
so not all applications which uses

150
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,730
cluster for support selinux so following

151
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:25,930
active applications which have a salinas

152
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:29,340
grande esta the client side as well so

153
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,740
one is fuse client which have fuse

154
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,049
underscore t type and others in the

155
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:36,340
first plane we serve and the first

156
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,210
underscore t type and but today i'm not

157
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:43,750
talking about this stuff this is what we

158
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,270
have in deficit test in linux I am

159
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,060
talking more about the client side of

160
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,620
presentation or how we can do it

161
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,900
applications can set count of strong

162
00:08:52,900 --> 00:09:00,760
clients so so currently with kind glossy

163
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,640
surface architecture clients cannot set

164
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,060
different cornerstone files which sets

165
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,270
on a glass surface volume and beings

166
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:13,030
rush S&S provides mandatory access

167
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:16,270
control so and Yossef is a file system

168
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,940
basically like UNIX comm blind or POSIX

169
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,589
government file system we need to

170
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:24,820
support SELinux so why it is not working

171
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,280
for us basically as I mentioned before

172
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,410
each file switch access cluster process

173
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:36,339
have contests so bricks have its own

174
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:36,970
contest

175
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:42,730
if application tries to write a count us

176
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,190
it will overwrite the existing brick

177
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:51,640
contest so it won't work with SC Linux

178
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,740
no it won't work with glass surface

179
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,360
process won't to work with excellence

180
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,360
and enabled environments so we need to

181
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,360
do some kind of facts so as I mentioned

182
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,120
before at the back end the sexiness will

183
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,330
be stored as a security dot SC next

184
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:11,970
attribute so we just need to map that

185
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:17,020
security dot so I Salinas attribute to

186
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:22,150
some other stuff so this is done with

187
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:25,540
help of an excellence translator so it

188
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,180
does the following so basically it stirs

189
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:28,889
the

190
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:30,600
Cillian scorned us from client as

191
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,759
trusted glass surface not selinux and it

192
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:37,679
will do the mapping from client to

193
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,319
server like if clients had some contest

194
00:10:40,319 --> 00:10:43,410
it will set s posture glass surface not

195
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,869
excellence at the back end and if client

196
00:10:45,869 --> 00:10:48,779
Lucas for the contest if we deal from

197
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:50,879
this contest and give back to the client

198
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,480
and we need to invert following costs

199
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,769
like set at or get data and Cadia and MK

200
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:01,410
note like this calls for system force in

201
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,139
Gloucester teams of network times we

202
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:06,329
call it test F folks so we need to

203
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:10,669
handle following F force and this

204
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:13,319
translator will be loaded at the server

205
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:23,189
graph by default and so by default every

206
00:11:23,189 --> 00:11:26,189
da m3 in the volume will get following

207
00:11:26,189 --> 00:11:27,899
converse which is the similar to brick

208
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:30,149
and application same can't change the

209
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:34,019
account accordingly and one of the

210
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:35,639
things which we need not of like the

211
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:37,769
Indian operations related to bluster

212
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:41,009
like self Feliway balance so they

213
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:42,959
actually not denied by a saline X like

214
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,679
we may need to migrate one file from one

215
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:48,869
brick to another you need to heal a file

216
00:11:48,869 --> 00:11:50,819
so those sort of questions are important

217
00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:53,970
for Gloucester we need not deny those

218
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,739
operations so we need to bypass those

219
00:11:55,739 --> 00:11:59,639
operations and at the server side we

220
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:02,459
don't do anything for the enforcement it

221
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:04,679
should be taken handled by the client

222
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:06,869
side like depending on clients on the

223
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:08,339
linux system they will handle it

224
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:12,629
accordingly and this is a small picture

225
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:14,579
which i've tried to draw like this will

226
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:19,619
happen at the server side so client can

227
00:12:19,619 --> 00:12:23,549
send with was right CH god we stalk on

228
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:26,429
SE manage to the server so it will be

229
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:28,350
and get that as a tetra call at the

230
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:31,889
server and protocol so is the first

231
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:33,629
translator with Susi so called it will

232
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:35,879
go out till SC Linux and s Salinas will

233
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:40,110
convert the call into the value change

234
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,999
the Rylander trusted loss refers to our

235
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:42,460
testing

236
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,770
and gear to posix and poses will set

237
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:52,260
that Astana attribute on that file and

238
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:59,410
so after doing this like the following

239
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,600
are the two clans which have current

240
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,940
support for S&S one is juice and other

241
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,900
one is NFS

242
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,940
so there is a bug in fuse clan which is

243
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:11,430
not fixed it so that so the users cannot

244
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,080
set a senior's can understand Tilly

245
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,900
fixing this issue and they have proposed

246
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,020
patch as well and case of and the first

247
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,540
clients like we have an labeled an

248
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,180
deficit to a future part of an F us 4.2

249
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,350
and you seen that and if us Primus can't

250
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,870
set the seniors count us directly

251
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,450
without an issue but there should be

252
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,670
some kind of operation should be

253
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,330
implemented at the NFS servers which

254
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:42,220
Gloucester is using that is NFS Ganesha

255
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,080
which is also missing

256
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,600
so the lots of stuff need to do in this

257
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:54,220
project and where are we know so it was

258
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,870
planned for 3.10 but it didn't make them

259
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:03,100
make heat up so we had to process two

260
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,460
patches posted upstream like one is the

261
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,110
implementation of the translator other

262
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,600
one is like setting the with countless

263
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,560
really create or add bricks and two or

264
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,170
more patches yeah I had to be started or

265
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:21,450
new to be done and one of them is so the

266
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:24,820
inherited con best from the pan directly

267
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,420
should be also modified with trusted dot

268
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:33,180
appending stuff so that is missing and

269
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,400
maybe for the other applications you

270
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,800
need to provide GF ApS for managing the

271
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,699
salinas contest

272
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:49,000
the following and if you have code s or

273
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,860
questions you can ask mailer so ask it

274
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:59,050
is e and these are from you some useful

275
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:07,260
links and they have questions
