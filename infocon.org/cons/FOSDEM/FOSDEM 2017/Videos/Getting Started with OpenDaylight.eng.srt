1
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:08,540
sarnax presentation is a tag-team affair

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,160
with Charles Michael and Giles firm

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,390
presenting getting started with open

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,680
daylight so there's gonna be a practical

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:43,670
I kind of covered the basics easy stuff

6
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,519
with open daylight and then jaws take

7
00:00:46,519 --> 00:00:51,640
you in more in-depth use case using bgp

8
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,490
[Applause]

9
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,060
[Music]

10
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,089
[Applause]

11
00:00:58,089 --> 00:01:02,179
open source cisco but the cool thing

12
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:04,069
about my job is I get to work with a lot

13
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:06,950
of stuff that Cisco does with open

14
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,960
source where we're contributing to open

15
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,310
source what we're using it in our

16
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,010
products and even Dale is just an

17
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,850
example of that so this is a pretty

18
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,910
introductory talk into open daylight and

19
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,580
I feel free to jump in with questions at

20
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,260
a time let me know and I'll certainly

21
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,000
try to leave room for questions at the

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,090
end

23
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,340
rundown of the agenda so just a level

24
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,530
set I'll go very quickly and briefly

25
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:41,690
into what Sdn is then how easy it is to

26
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,030
install and get started with open

27
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:48,520
daylight then when - a few use cases and

28
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,770
take the the easiest use case of the

29
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,910
ones I show you to demonstrate to you

30
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,990
because it's also something you can

31
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,060
pretty trivially then do on your own

32
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,330
setup on your own laptop so which

33
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,130
hopefully you'll you'll want to do and

34
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:09,800
find interesting after this talk so

35
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,220
firstly what is Sdn so they could when

36
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,410
Sdn first came out the whole idea was

37
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,870
that's the separation of the the control

38
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:27,110
plane and that the data plane it was

39
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,610
used it still is used but especially

40
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,930
initially that's what everyone was

41
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,070
thinking of and then this a logically

42
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,290
centralized control plane just instead

43
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,970
of having all the control spread across

44
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:41,090
all kinds of network elements you kind

45
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,860
of bring it into one place where you

46
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,080
call that's all and then we think I have

47
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,760
the right label switches to it's like we

48
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,260
can get rid of a lot of that expensive

49
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,270
hardware and and just run everything

50
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,760
using these white label switches and

51
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,100
it's not that that's not a valid case it

52
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,900
is and it certainly is still happening

53
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,500
that I think Sdn has come to to mean a

54
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,150
lot more and there's a lot more value to

55
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,530
SDM than just that so you can certainly

56
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,240
and I think should think of Sdn more bad

57
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,540
and one of the most valuable things

58
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,900
there is I think if you look at Sdn is

59
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,530
really unleashing the or providing you

60
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,750
access to the vast amount of information

61
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,120
that's in the network it's always been

62
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,480
there

63
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,950
but it's never really been something

64
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,170
that's been exposed to you as a an

65
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,740
application developer with Sdn that's

66
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,230
something that is very valuable and I

67
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,730
think that's really where the power of

68
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,300
Sdn lies it's in the network program

69
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,510
ability opportunities that Sdn exposes

70
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,140
for him so this is just illustrating

71
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,960
that broader definition that I just

72
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,880
mentioned the best en you see I mean of

73
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,350
course there still is the separation of

74
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,630
the control plane and the data plane to

75
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,600
the forwarding plane but what I'm really

76
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,070
trying to illustrate here is that

77
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,990
there's a lot of information that's down

78
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,630
deep into the network which now you have

79
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,830
you know when you're writing an

80
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,380
application can have access to so the

81
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,570
idea is that you can be seeing what's

82
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,220
going on with the network you can take

83
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,520
that into account your application can

84
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,230
do something intelligent based on that

85
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,690
kind of program that into the network

86
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,760
through the controller and you just have

87
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,490
this nice cycle you can start to write

88
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,270
some really very useful network aware

89
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:32,280
applications so if you think of that

90
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,310
broader definition of an SDN controller

91
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,530
what is it that we really expect or need

92
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,380
from an SDN controller and of course it

93
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,840
needs to work and make our network you

94
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,290
know a function but more importantly I

95
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:46,700
think

96
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,590
really want it to be a platform on which

97
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,150
you can write these network aware

98
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,860
applications and I was just talking

99
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,970
about you want it to be something that

100
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,800
provides you with a good development

101
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,750
environment providing those applications

102
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,800
and it's going to be very important to

103
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:10,280
you development environment that to you

104
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,250
and find you're gonna need two

105
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,880
abstractions because you're not going to

106
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,310
want to worry about what the underlying

107
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,690
network topology is you want it to be

108
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,430
able to abstract that away from you

109
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,380
and you also don't want to be worrying

110
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,240
about protocol independence because we

111
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,130
mentioned that you could use open flow

112
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,720
but there's a lot of other protocols we

113
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,060
could be using and you don't really at

114
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,890
the application level you don't want to

115
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,410
care or know or worry about those

116
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:41,320
details and notice that you know in that

117
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,540
did use the word open for that but it's

118
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,220
not limited to open flow this really

119
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,450
goes far beyond that

120
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,830
so now look let's jump and take a look

121
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:56,209
at open daylight a bit of an eye chart

122
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:59,419
here but the idea that I wanted to get

123
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:03,110
across to you is in that middle part so

124
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,939
all the different names that are really

125
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:06,559
in there but you busy have your basic

126
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:08,629
networking functions you know in the red

127
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:10,099
that's kind of in the middle you have

128
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:11,719
some enhanced networking functions

129
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:13,009
there's a lot of functionality that's

130
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:17,179
built into open daylight and those are

131
00:06:17,179 --> 00:06:18,949
the cool things that it kind of needs to

132
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:23,449
be a you know network controller and it

133
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:25,879
does have those jobs very well I think

134
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:28,490
more importantly is when we start to

135
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,689
think about from an application

136
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,349
perspective how it's going to work and

137
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:36,679
if you go let me go down first open flow

138
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:38,240
is the thing that's mentioned on the far

139
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,759
left hand side but it has plug-ins for

140
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:43,429
all kinds of other network protocols

141
00:06:43,429 --> 00:06:45,019
that you might want to support in your

142
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:46,519
network so you're not just limited to

143
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:49,159
open flow there's much more that it can

144
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,529
deal with and then as a application

145
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:54,019
developer it also exposes if you look at

146
00:06:54,019 --> 00:06:58,699
the top the api's you get restful api is

147
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:01,789
including rest comp and you also get in

148
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:04,369
that cough so you get these api is that

149
00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:06,949
you can build your applications on top

150
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:09,110
of and then opendaylight is going to

151
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,029
take care of abstracting away the rest

152
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:13,159
the different topologies the different

153
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:16,240
protocols that are underneath

154
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,740
so maybe just to back up and give you a

155
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,350
little a brief history of open daylight

156
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:27,910
so it was founded back in 2013 launched

157
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,289
as the project within the Linux

158
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:31,600
Foundation and basically started when a

159
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,460
group of founding companies came

160
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,410
together and contributed a bunch of

161
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:39,120
software and more importantly maybe

162
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,130
development resources to kick it off and

163
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:45,729
get it going and it grew very quickly I

164
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:48,370
say 600 plus contributors I know they

165
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,710
were over 600 and obviously as a number

166
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,449
that continues to grow as this the lines

167
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:56,919
of code and most of it is written in

168
00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:58,570
Java so when you think of open daylight

169
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,669
he can think of it as being a Java

170
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:04,300
project the first release came out in

171
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,030
February of 2014 it was called hydrogen

172
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,280
and since then they've been having

173
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,220
releases roughly every eight months

174
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,130
where you saw that a charter had at the

175
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,900
beginning there's all kinds of projects

176
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,460
and functionality and pieces in there a

177
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,979
lot of plugins at the bottom so a lot of

178
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:22,389
people are contributing to open daylight

179
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:25,210
in different areas but it has a very

180
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,240
modular design which allows that that

181
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,830
the idea is hey every once in a while we

182
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,270
want to pull all this together and do a

183
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,130
stable release and so that's something

184
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,740
that it's built into the planning that

185
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,080
every eight months essentially come out

186
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,760
with a new release and pretty much been

187
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,029
able to stick with that and the current

188
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:47,230
stable release is called blonde and the

189
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,000
next release which will be coming out in

190
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,420
May is called carbon and in case you

191
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,850
haven't you know guessed the release

192
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,709
names all named after elements in the

193
00:08:56,709 --> 00:08:59,830
periodic table so you also get to when

194
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,959
you play with open daylight to learn a

195
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,920
bit about that as well

196
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,700
I very briefly just go over from a

197
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,350
software architecture point of view I

198
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,300
already mentioned it's it's Java that

199
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,310
was just chosen as the language that was

200
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:19,330
going to be used for it uses the maven

201
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,220
build system which if you work at all

202
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,750
with Java you'd be very familiar with

203
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,480
and then also use this craft and and

204
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,130
craft is important because when you

205
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,740
install I remember there's that time

206
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,590
tons of functionality in there almost no

207
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,750
one really wants to use every the

208
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,060
functionality that it has in fact you

209
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,010
usually use a small subset in your

210
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,860
network and if you turned everything on

211
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,540
I wouldn't want to guarantee phew that's

212
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:53,920
actually going to work so features

213
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,930
install just the core that it needs to

214
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,930
start up and then you can enable

215
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,940
individual features the ones that you

216
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,370
specifically need for your use cases in

217
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,350
your network and we're going to that in

218
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:13,180
a bit more detail later on let's look at

219
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,110
the installation and if you can't read

220
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,610
the details here I'm just giving you the

221
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,290
link where you can go and download the

222
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,330
code you're always going to find at this

223
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:26,080
place the stable releases like the

224
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,150
student the latest stable version for

225
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,750
each of their most recent releases so

226
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,780
you can go there and just grab that

227
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,520
download it and then it's just something

228
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:41,050
that some unzipping it and just typing

229
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,960
this command this bin craft and with

230
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,780
that it's going to load up and no

231
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,930
complicated configuration nothing like

232
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,610
that that you need to do because as I

233
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,870
mentioned the beginning it's going to

234
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,120
start with very few features and then

235
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,750
once it's up and running you will be

236
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,610
able to turn on individual features that

237
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,970
you want

238
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,530
so playing around with the features in

239
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:09,560
carafe just a few handy commands here

240
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,530
you can do feature Coleman West that

241
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:13,880
will show you all the features that are

242
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,090
available on the platform feature list -

243
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,190
I will tell you which ones are already

244
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,410
installed and then you can go and you

245
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:25,310
can install one feature if you want you

246
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,180
can install multiple features and you

247
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,040
can also uninstall features which which

248
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,310
is handy but the caveat here are the

249
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:36,080
tricky thing that I want to warn you of

250
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,750
is when you do uninstall a feature from

251
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,600
the CLI perspective it looked like it

252
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,730
was uninstalled that's actually continue

253
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,920
going to continue to exist and live on

254
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,290
within the controller unless you you

255
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,900
stop the controller and then we started

256
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,650
again using this bencroft and a clean to

257
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,810
say a clean install so just a word of

258
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,180
warning there because that could trip

259
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:04,490
yet so latest look like this screenshot

260
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,230
that I have here this is just after I

261
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,480
installed open daylight initially and I

262
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,920
did a list of the features that are

263
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,160
there and this little X means the

264
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,050
features installed and the installed

265
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,820
list and you can see there's very very

266
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,500
little there this is just the core

267
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,190
platform and then there's something in

268
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:26,600
it I'll show you shortly called deluxe

269
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,380
deluxe is just the kind of graphical the

270
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,120
user interface the front-end that gets

271
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,150
put on you have the CLI but that deluxe

272
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:39,350
is a very useful interface that you can

273
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:41,450
use as well so in the example here I'm

274
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,339
just showing you well if I wanted to

275
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:45,500
figure out how to turn on the deluxe

276
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,390
feature install it how did I go about

277
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,700
doing that and so I use that featureless

278
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,950
command and just that for deluxe and

279
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,870
they'll show me all the things that that

280
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,480
contained the locks and in this example

281
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,460
what I did was I installed the deluxe

282
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,530
core which gives me the minimum set it

283
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,520
could have also that deluxe all

284
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,080
I would have just installed a few more

285
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,520
things and then I show you the after

286
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,650
running back command now if I do a

287
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,980
feature list again I can see that I got

288
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,839
all the core parts of deluxe installed

289
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:18,800
once I have that then I can just go to

290
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,950
navigate to open up deluxe and in this

291
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,140
example I could local host because I'm

292
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,089
running it locally on my laptop so that

293
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:28,920
would just be whatever the IP address of

294
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,029
your controllers and on port 81 81 you

295
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:35,460
log in and this is an example of what it

296
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,380
looks like and we'll go into that a

297
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:43,380
little more detail later too so now some

298
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,500
example use cases and the first one

299
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,510
which this is one I'll go into in a bit

300
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:51,839
more detail with the demo is to show you

301
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,610
how you can know that opendaylight and

302
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:57,060
then use something called mini net how

303
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,370
many people have heard of mini nut okay

304
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:02,850
great so you probably have too much

305
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,680
difficulty with this done the idea is

306
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,709
that to use a VM that has many net

307
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:09,690
inside of it and just use that to create

308
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:12,570
a sample Network which you can then have

309
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:17,370
opendaylight play with and then just to

310
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,720
get it in your head but I'm not going to

311
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,029
go into details on either of these but

312
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:23,130
you actually hear talks later on today

313
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,920
they talk a bit more and you know about

314
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,620
both another example use case which is

315
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,640
very interesting you've probably heard

316
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,279
about VPP and this just shows

317
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,600
pictorially how you could use

318
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,820
opendaylight and with VPP as the

319
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,410
underlying network underneath it

320
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:42,000
maybe maybe next year we'll show that

321
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,600
one and then here's the BGP LS because

322
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,970
again there's the the reason I want to

323
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,910
show these different ones is the

324
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,570
mignonette one is using open flow and

325
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,820
where's here and now you can see that

326
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,900
another use case where we're not using

327
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,089
open flow we're using PGP and PSF

328
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:02,510
instead

329
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,150
okay so now we're going to go through

330
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:08,660
how to set this up for yourself and and

331
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,490
what the demo is going to do so I

332
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,770
mentioned using mini net within a VM so

333
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,320
I just downloaded that and followed

334
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,440
these instructions thanks to Bryan

335
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,840
Linkletter he provided fantastic

336
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,810
instructions for how to do this so I put

337
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,400
that link there because I didn't want to

338
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,500
try to describe it again myself he did a

339
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,770
wonderful job and so then in one

340
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,660
terminal we'll start that opendaylight

341
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,730
which I installed just as I showed you

342
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:39,770
by downloading it and and stand we

343
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,210
covered that in a previous slide and

344
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,620
then the other one I'm going to spin out

345
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:45,530
mini mat and I'm gonna log into it and

346
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:48,230
tell it to create a network that creates

347
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,930
that has three switches and this

348
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:54,500
attached to each switch and I'm just

349
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,790
going to tell it to talk to my

350
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,800
controller I'm I opened a light

351
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,420
controller and this happens to be the IP

352
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,790
address which the first time networks

353
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,540
giving me so you just replaced that with

354
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,090
whatever your IP address is and this

355
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:11,690
other IP address the 192 168 IP address

356
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:14,060
that's where it got assigned by mini net

357
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:18,520
to my VM

358
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,840
oh and then all go into the browser and

359
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,160
we'll take a look and play around

360
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,690
without a bit so that's just a

361
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,640
screenshot of what many Nets gonna do

362
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,440
when it starts that I won't spend any

363
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,260
more time on these we'll go ahead and

364
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,610
give the demo a try and if it doesn't

365
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,820
work then I'll fall back to to using

366
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:48,580
them so okay so let's see so here is my

367
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:55,100
opendaylight controller and if I just do

368
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,270
that then craft command that we

369
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,670
mentioned before you can see it starting

370
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:06,500
up and while that's starting up why

371
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,390
don't I go ahead and take a look at my

372
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,810
here's what I have at the bottom here my

373
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,990
mini that VM that I installed and I'll

374
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:20,650
get that get that going as well

375
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:31,890
okay so opendaylight started I have my

376
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,740
prompt here I can do like one of the

377
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,240
commands that we talked about feature

378
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,460
list - ah hi and I can see all the

379
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,700
features I have installed quite a few

380
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,559
because I already ran that command that

381
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:45,780
I showed you before that was going to

382
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,700
install the minimum feature set that I

383
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,570
needed for VirtualBox it's in the slide

384
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,400
so you can find that yourself but you'll

385
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,530
see you know because of that I have

386
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,860
deluxe installed I have the aw to switch

387
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,990
that I need I have less cost all of

388
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,960
those are going to be used for the rest

389
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,299
of this demo so those are all installed

390
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:13,820
and I should now be able to go and login

391
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:17,100
okay so I'm logged into opendaylight and

392
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,500
I'm looking at my network and I have no

393
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,549
network that's because I haven't done

394
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:25,830
anything with yet so it started I need

395
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,409
to log into it the credentials are mini

396
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:30,510
met mini net pretty easy to remember and

397
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,690
it's also in the slides and now I'm just

398
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:39,000
going to run those commands to start up

399
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,919
a little sample network and I just put

400
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,169
it in a script called start mini net and

401
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:45,090
network it's just one command though I

402
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,890
just didn't want to have a bunch of

403
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:51,000
typos when I'm here okay so that started

404
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,159
that now if I go back to my opendaylight

405
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:57,030
and check it out and reload so now I can

406
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,710
see my three switches those just came up

407
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:03,270
within mini never see my host yet but if

408
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:07,490
I generate some traffic do a ping

409
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:11,340
they're all connected so they work and

410
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,470
if I do a reload now I can see them as

411
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,990
well so just a simple example of how

412
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,000
this could that this network now gets

413
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,039
discovered and attached into my

414
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:23,270
opendaylight network

415
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,100
now I can look at my different modes and

416
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,520
I can see make this a little bit bigger

417
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,000
maybe I can see all the connections that

418
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,549
I have in just terms of statistics not

419
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:38,260
all lots going on because I just created

420
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,539
this network but I think what might be

421
00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:42,250
more interesting is I wanted to show you

422
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,500
because the point I wanted to get across

423
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,100
was you know application development and

424
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,390
how this is good for network aware

425
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:52,390
applications and this is pretty cool

426
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,419
this shows you all of the marbles

427
00:19:55,419 --> 00:19:57,820
because maybe I didn't mention this

428
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,950
before but if in daylight's has a it's

429
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,409
really a model driven architecture well

430
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,780
you put the functionality that you're

431
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,340
putting into it you defined in a yang

432
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,559
model and then it reads that yang model

433
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,460
in and it's able to generate api's and

434
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,500
based off of that so these are all the

435
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,240
api's that are available to me within

436
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,760
the platform and there's there's quite a

437
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:25,870
few actually it depends what I've loaded

438
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:28,210
into the network but just to give you an

439
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,640
example one that I know has something in

440
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:40,450
it is if I go to the inventory and this

441
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,890
is just where I can go and look and see

442
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:44,409
what's in my network so if I look at the

443
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,690
operational data there see you'll see

444
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,309
this convention most the time there's an

445
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:50,320
operational data store and a

446
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,030
configuration data store the

447
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,980
configuration is what was there when I

448
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,230
loaded up when I started out my

449
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,330
controller and I can go and I can do a

450
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,130
command if I click on this see it's

451
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,100
showing me at the bottom what the

452
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,200
command is the rest command so I can do

453
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,030
a get of all the nodes that are in my

454
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:10,480
configuration and you see I get an area

455
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,120
because there was no configuration no

456
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,830
configuration though configured nodes

457
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,669
they got discovered that at runtime so

458
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:24,539
if instead I look at my operational and

459
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:27,720
go on the nodes and do this same command

460
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,559
fingers crossed this should actually

461
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:32,640
work and it looks like it did

462
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,250
and if I go down you can see what got

463
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,250
returned and deluxe just gives me a nice

464
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,950
way to scan through this this is exactly

465
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,260
what we saw in the picture before and I

466
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,150
have three different notes open flow one

467
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,429
two and three and I can see information

468
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:50,490
about each of them the packets and that

469
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,540
they have and whatnot

470
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,280
now the reason I'm showing you this is

471
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,500
because and if this is what's available

472
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,049
to you now programmatically through just

473
00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:01,200
basic last calls and this is a very

474
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,990
simple example but hopefully it

475
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,480
impresses on you that now as an

476
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,460
application developer I have very easy

477
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,470
access to this information which before

478
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:14,660
I may not have been able to to get it

479
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,110
okay let me get out of this and I'm just

480
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:28,299
gonna jump back to my slides

481
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,140
okay and now I just want to leave you

482
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:37,299
with if some additional resources as I

483
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:39,429
mentioned that I work with open source

484
00:22:39,429 --> 00:22:42,429
at Cisco so everything that I'm working

485
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:46,690
on within Cisco can be found in this

486
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:49,059
open source dev Center this is where the

487
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:50,559
projects that we work on like open

488
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,539
daylight OpenStack you can find

489
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:53,740
information about them

490
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,720
and what's this goes doing and and where

491
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,390
we're using it in our products and

492
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:59,830
there's a whole site where you can get

493
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,990
more information this I wanted to show

494
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,890
because these are a bunch of

495
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,500
applications that we've written the an

496
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,200
open source they are free they're really

497
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,860
just there to kind of help plant that

498
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,110
seed that hey this is a great platform

499
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,299
for writing applications opendaylight is

500
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:18,520
and it's it's quite straightforward to

501
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,039
do it not only are these useful but they

502
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,679
serve really as is great kind of

503
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,140
training tools I would say so you can

504
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,559
download those all this other thing

505
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:32,049
which is quite handy is the mini net it

506
00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:34,149
was quite straightforward for me to get

507
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:36,250
a VM and just spin it up on my own

508
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,440
laptop but you can imagine that maybe

509
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,370
you want to do something more

510
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,700
complicated where you have like some

511
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,590
some real network equipment behind it

512
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,230
and so we have these sand boxes which

513
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,630
you can also use for free login to them

514
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:53,110
and you know experiment with some more

515
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,659
complicated Network examples and Giles

516
00:23:55,659 --> 00:23:58,120
will show you a kind of an example of

517
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,450
that later on

518
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:03,279
and then this is just a place you can go

519
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,840
for help in case you're having problems

520
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,510
with or have questions or want to share

521
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:12,669
something and that's basically it

522
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:15,580
so if they left a few minutes for

523
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,799
questions and if anyone has any

524
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:22,889
questions yeah

525
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:34,469
I don't you know I don't think that much

526
00:24:34,469 --> 00:24:36,819
yeah the question was how much of open

527
00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:39,609
daylight's implemented in Cisco ACI and

528
00:24:39,609 --> 00:24:41,679
I think there as far as I know they're

529
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,629
they're quite separate yeah totally

530
00:24:43,629 --> 00:24:45,988
different

531
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,500
ODL I guess the way I was characterized

532
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,940
it until Charles was saying I guess

533
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:01,000
level bounce you know when you cut in

534
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,980
Paris they see all your parents and

535
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,370
culture

536
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:09,530
thank you can you compare this with all

537
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:14,270
my new digital display anything to the

538
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,680
downside

539
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,240
you know my Swiss Army knife is not

540
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,400
Bessel there's a little attentions when

541
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,850
you have your own

542
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,830
and I guess the demos on the show later

543
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:31,850
read to me where the values

544
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,960
so you can keep one plug in to learn

545
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,640
something about that look at one plug to

546
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,030
do

547
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,420
yeah it's it is that is open daylight

548
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:55,710
ready for telco nfe traffic and I would

549
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:58,370
say yes I mean there's some big

550
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:02,040
providers using I mean AT&T is is using

551
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,290
it it's part of their their ecomp

552
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:06,200
platform

553
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,060
Tencent has been very kind of open and

554
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,970
sharing how they are using and if you've

555
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,590
never looked into tents that in their

556
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,690
network it's it's just amazing the scale

557
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:16,890
that they're working with you can see

558
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:18,180
why they'd want to have something like

559
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,390
open daylight but but they've they

560
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:23,310
really brought back a lot of learnings

561
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,890
too and maybe driven some of the the

562
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,990
performance or stability stuff back into

563
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:30,620
open daylight

564
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:59,590
yes yep any other questions

565
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:04,850
okay well thank you very much

566
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:08,629
[Applause]
