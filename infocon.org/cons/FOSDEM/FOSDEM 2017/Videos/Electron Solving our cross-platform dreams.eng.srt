1
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:15,170
it's usually where I put it okay all

2
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:18,020
right welcome to this talk I've added

3
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,730
this little disclaimer for desktop

4
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,470
because actually creating cross-platform

5
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,650
applications is relatively easy if it's

6
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,539
web or something like that so very that

7
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:31,270
little disclaimer so I think looking

8
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,260
through some of the other talks in this

9
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,630
track including the last one the dream

10
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,960
of kind of writing code once and then

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,510
multi using it multi purposing in

12
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,949
different applications is nothing new

13
00:00:42,949 --> 00:00:44,719
nothing new at all

14
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,390
yeah the talk previously covered a

15
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,160
language that or a framework that you

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,070
can use for that this is kind of the

17
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,170
first instance I found of this quote but

18
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,710
I don't think it's new and in fact 1995

19
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,829
even seems too recent to me but of

20
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:03,140
course I guess from the same company one

21
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,960
of the first sort of big attempts at

22
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,140
this kind of write once run mostly

23
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,860
everywhere with little adaption was Java

24
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,220
and still is really and also of course

25
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,290
languages like Python and many others I

26
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:23,659
mean it's not a new concept and then

27
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:26,960
again frameworks these are just one

28
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,100
there's also things like xamarin Flash

29
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:35,180
flex be for J's Ojo many others come and

30
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,970
gone but I guess kind of the the thing

31
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:38,810
with a lot of them is they always

32
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,229
require you to learn something new so

33
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:44,420
maybe a new type of language maybe some

34
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,850
new variants on the language some new

35
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,770
paradigms

36
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:53,030
they were never completely easy to get

37
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,280
started with you have to sort of learn

38
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,159
something first but it's always been a

39
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,899
dream to accomplish basically I guess

40
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:02,299
because a lot of developers are kind of

41
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:03,680
a bit lazy and we'd rather focus on

42
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,070
something else and kind of I guess where

43
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,288
I sort of start this a little bit is a

44
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:11,420
lecture on to me I'll explain what it is

45
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,690
soon but you probably know already but

46
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,790
to me it seemed a little similar to

47
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,350
Apache Cordova or

48
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,570
I actually encountered Apache Cordova

49
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,990
when it was still night Robi PhoneGap

50
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,900
which ages me slightly and it was the

51
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,870
same principle right HTML Javascript

52
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,610
running on multiple platforms in the

53
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,680
same sort of way have like some native

54
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,780
rappers that fill in the missing pieces

55
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,330
and the code that you write once can run

56
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:39,860
on multiple platforms it was a similar

57
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,840
it still is a similar principle although

58
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,240
I'm mobile starting to become less

59
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,900
relevant actually but it's kind of a

60
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,280
similar principle and I would probably

61
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,010
argue it was an inspiration for electron

62
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,420
as well I guess because it does a very

63
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,620
similar thing so enter electron what is

64
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,870
electron I've alluded to already it's a

65
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,130
framework for writing JavaScript CSS

66
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,140
HTML if you need it to make

67
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,400
cross-platform desktop applications it

68
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,310
has some other similar rivals in

69
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,340
inverted commas like NJ WS but for some

70
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,460
reason electron has just sort of become

71
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,380
much more popular and much more

72
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,580
widespread it could be because it's

73
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,050
created by github and lots of people

74
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,330
know github it could be the people who

75
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,580
decided to use it it could be that the

76
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,380
level of integration with the native

77
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,240
platforms is better I'm not really sure

78
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,710
I'm not going to cast any kind of

79
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,170
judgment on that but I think we can

80
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,090
argue that it is certainly much more

81
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,850
popular than the other alternatives so

82
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,350
you've probably used it without even

83
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,930
realizing if you've used any of these

84
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,750
applications plus many others you're

85
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,180
using electron slack is always

86
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,550
controversial some people say it is some

87
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,110
people say it isn't they sometimes say

88
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,610
it is they sometimes say it isn't but

89
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,520
I'm pretty sure it is it's hard to say

90
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,880
exactly I guess my first interaction

91
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,820
with electron was active I really love

92
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,570
active I use it almost all the time and

93
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,070
to be honest with you I really know much

94
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,180
more about atom that I know about

95
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,149
electron actually this will be a

96
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:18,709
moderate lead should actually talk to

97
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:19,880
electron I think I actually know much

98
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:28,000
more about atom so it is from github and

99
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,990
javascript says desktop application

100
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,270
version 1.5 was released

101
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,290
last week and it is moving quite quickly

102
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,030
in fact when I first did this talk a

103
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,970
version of this talk last August it I

104
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,520
only just got to version one I think so

105
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,190
in a few months it's iterating quite

106
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,510
quickly at the moment and improving

107
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,460
quite a lot and we'll come back to that

108
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,850
in a minute so as you would sort of

109
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,700
expect being a JavaScript framework

110
00:04:54,700 --> 00:05:00,290
installing is pretty straightforward npm

111
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:04,160
install or if you're a Mac user Cass

112
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,260
groom which I don't know just slightly

113
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,430
different way of it still to get to end

114
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,660
up with pretty much the same thing and

115
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,410
you end up kind of with a command-line

116
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,550
tool but also a I will show you this you

117
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:32,180
also end up with a binary here as well

118
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,130
that you can actually drag and drop your

119
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,530
code onto to run it while still testing

120
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:41,020
mostly you can also kind of use this to

121
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,310
package your applications at the end as

122
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,340
well

123
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:51,379
and much as its a cross-platform tool

124
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:54,050
then actually most of the options are

125
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,569
applicable to every platform that you

126
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:58,729
develop on as well that's kind of what

127
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:00,590
happens when you open it this screenshot

128
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:05,719
is slightly out of date and then if your

129
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:10,009
CLA user it's pretty much what you'd

130
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:13,789
expect just run the command I'll show

131
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:15,229
you a demo application then I'm going to

132
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:19,849
kind of show what it does so I have a

133
00:06:19,849 --> 00:06:26,870
very simple application here this is

134
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,340
running an atom we're creating an

135
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,439
electron application in atom this is

136
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:37,009
getting very matrix so it comprises a

137
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:39,039
couple of basic different things a

138
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,020
package.json file with dependencies

139
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,669
unsurprisingly one of the main

140
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:48,379
dependencies this electron a main

141
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:50,360
javascript file that contains your code

142
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,580
and then kind of where all the magic

143
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:57,439
happens in this app folder so I'm just

144
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:59,419
gonna run this first and we'll see what

145
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,878
it does it's very very interesting a

146
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:10,669
Wi-Fi allowing there we go it loads the

147
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:13,550
Marvel Comics API which is a terrible

148
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,479
API to use but really fun to demonstrate

149
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,240
and actually if I can have do not

150
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,370
disturb all and you'll also see that I

151
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,250
got a notification as well I got a

152
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,629
system notification as well when

153
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:30,050
everything loaded this is a web

154
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,689
application but as far as we can see

155
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:35,210
actually I have left developer tools on

156
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,599
and so you can see it is effectively

157
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:44,000
just Chrome ish application there and

158
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,139
that's pretty much it nothing

159
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:46,460
particularly interesting in this

160
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,710
application we also have the default

161
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:53,438
icon can't quite see but down here

162
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:00,360
so just to break down those files a

163
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,210
little bit the main.js file which we'll

164
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,949
have a quick look at in a minute starts

165
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:06,780
the application and creates the browser

166
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,449
window to render the HTML and sets up

167
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:11,160
kind of the basics of the native

168
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,460
bindings and the index that HTML is the

169
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:20,870
web page that is rendered by default so

170
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:26,970
the main file is probably the the most

171
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:34,409
interesting one requiring setting up the

172
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:36,110
application window and the browser

173
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,479
loading the default file I haven't

174
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,270
really changed anything from the default

175
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:47,310
application that you create here you can

176
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,230
see there's a little bit of custom code

177
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:53,730
for Mac OS because when you close the

178
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,220
final window in a Mac application you

179
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,140
want to quit the application I mean you

180
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,970
could actually uncomment that but the

181
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,440
whole F the whole point is making it

182
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,670
feel as native as possible in each

183
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,170
platform but really that's the only

184
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,080
platform specific thing there and also

185
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,620
in here is where you can add things like

186
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:14,339
turning on the turnin the developer

187
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:17,010
tools on and off or setting up actions

188
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:20,279
that can happen in menus or the dock

189
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:25,140
icon or a start icon or the I'm not sure

190
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,209
what the launcher whatever it's called

191
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:29,040
in various Linux distributions the kind

192
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,810
of interactions you can make with the

193
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,089
application from the operating system

194
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:34,350
and that's pretty much it if you've done

195
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,290
any JavaScript it's all pretty simple so

196
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,120
far and this is kind of almost a

197
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,350
disappointing thing with an electron

198
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,820
talk it is actually really simple

199
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,700
there's not actually much to it it's

200
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,200
just JavaScript once you get past that

201
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,240
file so yeah

202
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:57,389
I hope I forgot dumb thing there there

203
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:00,209
we go yeah we already had a look at that

204
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:01,920
sort of jump straight into the code

205
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,999
instead of the presentation so great

206
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:11,490
that's during development but how do we

207
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,009
get it to actually look like a an

208
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:16,680
application at the end of it all this is

209
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,209
called packaging it there's a couple of

210
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:20,879
different ways you can do it the first

211
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,040
step you do is create an SR archive

212
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,579
which is actually basically making it

213
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:29,579
not look like it's just JavaScript and

214
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:31,259
I'll show you how this works in a minute

215
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:32,550
but that's what I can't exactly remember

216
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,499
what it stands for but that's what you

217
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:37,769
create first it copies the files that

218
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:40,620
are needed rename distribute it and

219
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,300
these are kind of the steps you can go

220
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,730
through manually or my preferred option

221
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,949
is to use one of the third-party tools

222
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:49,860
and there's two of them that kind of do

223
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,740
all this for you and up now comes a

224
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:58,829
pretty lengthy looking command so this

225
00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:01,740
is another NPM module that it's not it's

226
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,660
not necessarily official from the

227
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,189
elektron team but it's highly

228
00:11:05,189 --> 00:11:07,790
recommended

229
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:14,669
have some trouble with this group

230
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:29,059
now it's got worse okay right okay

231
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:34,619
so here we set the location of the code

232
00:11:34,619 --> 00:11:37,980
we give the application a name we set

233
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,749
the platforms and the architecture and

234
00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:43,199
you can just do all and it will package

235
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:47,069
for thirty-two 64-bit Linux 32 64 bit

236
00:11:47,069 --> 00:11:49,709
windows 32 64-bit MAC I there are even

237
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,920
need 32-bit max anymore I'm not sure or

238
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,529
you could do all we can set whether we

239
00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:58,230
want the SR archive or not we can prune

240
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,410
some of the NPM dependencies where it

241
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,299
goes we're just saying overwrite leave

242
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:06,059
if it's there most importantly an icon

243
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,519
file and this is probably where it gets

244
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,629
the hardest for cross-platform because

245
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:15,360
every desktop where s has a slight dent

246
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,369
format for their icons so this is

247
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,739
specific to Mac but you kind of have to

248
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,410
have something for each one to make it

249
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,049
look the most native thing so I'm gonna

250
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:27,869
run this and show you what happens

251
00:12:27,869 --> 00:12:30,929
and everything's vanished at the top

252
00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:33,769
there okay

253
00:12:37,249 --> 00:12:43,559
okay so fortunately I have also

254
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:44,970
completing there then if it sucked it

255
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,160
all again

256
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,109
hopefully this is gonna be fine it takes

257
00:12:49,109 --> 00:12:52,529
a little bit of time not too long in the

258
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:54,449
older versions of this you have to

259
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:57,480
specify the electron version as well you

260
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,919
can't do that if you want but you don't

261
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:01,049
have to anymore it will now just find

262
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:03,389
the most appropriate version as well for

263
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:13,970
you and here is the final output there

264
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:19,169
looks pretty authentic I am using

265
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:25,290
copyrighted material here and again it

266
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,629
will look kind of the same

267
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:30,059
there was a notification again which is

268
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,109
you can't actually see because

269
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:36,329
everything seems to stop but you can't

270
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:38,309
see my menu bar but now all I have is a

271
00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:44,329
quick option so let me just try that

272
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,590
it's a little bit cut off but you can

273
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,600
see I don't have the toggle developer

274
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,280
tools or anything like that and there's

275
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,260
no way of I'm right-clicking I'm

276
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,350
controlled clicking I can't get anything

277
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,480
now now it looks like a proper proper

278
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,190
application as far everyone is concerned

279
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:16,850
so what are some of the things you can

280
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:20,510
do you can get notifications we saw that

281
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,790
it's using kind of html5 notifications

282
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,250
that get routed through to the

283
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,290
notification system of the operating

284
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:30,260
system I have tested this on Mac on

285
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,170
Windows and on three varieties of Linux

286
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:35,030
and they all go where you expect which

287
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,920
is actually quite cool especially on

288
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,840
Linux because notifications can be quite

289
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,360
inconsistent and they all they go in the

290
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,170
right place which is good you get things

291
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,550
like you can get things like recent

292
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:49,820
documents on the Mac OS that can be very

293
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,460
right-clicking on the dock icon on

294
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,950
Windows and Linux I think the same you

295
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,950
can create your own custom menus this

296
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,490
includes as I say like a dock and in

297
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:05,210
Windows also you can add things like you

298
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,560
could right click on a folder in Windows

299
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,690
and say open in an application so

300
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,250
setting up those associations and things

301
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,920
like that also presented file is the

302
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,970
something you can do Mac OS where you

303
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,150
click the top document icon and it will

304
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,350
show you the folder structure of where

305
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,450
the file is that also works things like

306
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,390
that you can create preferences and all

307
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,160
sorts of things and the one thing I will

308
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,280
actually say since I kind of lasted this

309
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,070
presentation and have been using Windows

310
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,580
and it looks a bit more at work there it

311
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,440
as with a lot of kind of JavaScript

312
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,910
frameworks often the Mac support was

313
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,800
better than anything else and the

314
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,480
windows in the next leg behind a bit and

315
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,310
the recent updates have actually made

316
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,280
that a lot better some of the slowness

317
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,580
some of the rendering issues that used

318
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,790
to be in some earlier versions actually

319
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,370
are a lot better now so they've been

320
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,470
focusing a lot more on making it truly

321
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,280
cross-platform

322
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,910
not cross-platform but better on one

323
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:08,350
so that's quite nice negatives okay

324
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,930
the application size is one actually

325
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,010
going to show you something interesting

326
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,940
here so and you can do equivalent on

327
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,580
every other operating system you can see

328
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,200
for a relatively simple application one

329
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,480
hundred and ten megabytes if I crack

330
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:32,310
that open most of it is here is it

331
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:43,509
I've lost it most of it is that file the

332
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:46,300
electron framework 107 megabytes of that

333
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,740
110 is the helper when I last did this

334
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,829
presentation it was 175 megabytes so

335
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:57,399
it's actually got a lot better and these

336
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:01,259
are desktop applications not mobile so

337
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:03,579
it's a compromise there's compromises

338
00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:04,809
everywhere this is the thing that's

339
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:06,549
doing a lot of that magic and I don't

340
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:08,199
have the actual numbers for other

341
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:11,500
operating systems but that will add a

342
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,770
fair bit of overhead there but that

343
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:19,179
that's not too bad but yeah like 99 and

344
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:21,130
95% of the application is one framework

345
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:26,619
per se that's one problem CPU memory

346
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:29,650
performance again used to be a lot worse

347
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:32,289
if you've used slack then slack used to

348
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:35,559
traditionally be pretty poor that

349
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:38,919
especially network and CPU overhead that

350
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:40,630
again has got a lot better with recent

351
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,159
slack versions and recent electron

352
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:43,990
versions and I would actually argue that

353
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,090
a lot of the reasons that slack

354
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,070
especially is so unperformed is you have

355
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,110
about 15 channels with all with

356
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,360
request.open so that's of course going

357
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,179
to cause quite a lot of overhead but

358
00:17:55,179 --> 00:17:58,299
even with atom for example on Windows

359
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:02,440
and Linux still opening takes a fair bit

360
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,350
of time to open I mean if we think about

361
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,510
how long it takes to open compared to

362
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,400
applications from five years ago really

363
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,990
it's nothing but it is still a little

364
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,250
slow to get started and I still get some

365
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,380
rendering issues every now and then

366
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,640
things like that but it's getting better

367
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,440
of course one of the main negatives is

368
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,380
it's still not native it it does a

369
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,020
pretty good job but it isn't so you do

370
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,549
lose a lot of possibilities for

371
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:34,659
optimization and API is that are

372
00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:36,720
available in the kind of proper

373
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,559
development frameworks that aren't

374
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,539
available but again a lot of those are

375
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:42,880
being patched up quite quickly and there

376
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,679
are some platform inconsistencies as

377
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:47,289
already said again getting better but

378
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:49,160
still there

379
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:53,640
but I guess you offset that with the

380
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,970
fact that JavaScript is relatively easy

381
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,549
to get started with a lot of people know

382
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:02,549
how to write it and you can effectively

383
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:05,220
write some reasonably complicated

384
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,920
applications like for example Nilus the

385
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,720
mail application is a fully featured

386
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,390
email client Adam is a fully featured

387
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,200
text editor you know pretty good

388
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,370
applications unless you're writing a new

389
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,380
office suite or something it will cover

390
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:22,950
a lot of use cases that you might have

391
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,230
so you can offset some of those

392
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,210
performance issues with the time-saving

393
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:30,390
and I think the other thing is electron

394
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,650
has kind of become the victim of his own

395
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,710
success it has become so popular that

396
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,870
every person in their dog is now writing

397
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,250
applications that are basically just

398
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,559
websites in wrappers and you get a lot

399
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,350
of bad applications but that's kind of

400
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,150
another issue really that's always the

401
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,950
problem I love things that lower the

402
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,150
barrier to entry but of course it allows

403
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,890
more stuff to be made as well which may

404
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,590
be inconsistent but I suggest you give

405
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,020
it a go some of the getting started

406
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,929
guides are a little little hard to

407
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:02,429
follow I would say I'm a documentation

408
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:05,040
person so so it's kind of the thing I

409
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,040
always keep an eye out for but give it a

410
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:13,080
go and you can make applications for for

411
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,620
everybody

412
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,679
relatively easily that's me

413
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:21,510
I actually slightly out of date I'm

414
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,220
actually a technical writer for a

415
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,080
company in Berlin and if you're

416
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,400
interested in documentation I'm doing

417
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,419
another talk at 4:20 so very soon on

418
00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:35,820
automating documentation no one likes to

419
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,309
write it how can you get more of it to

420
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:42,270
be written for you and if you like my

421
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,500
chinchillas you could go to my website

422
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,350
and buy t-shirts or you can download the

423
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:49,860
SVG's and do what you like with them but

424
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,620
thanks very much any questions

425
00:20:52,620 --> 00:21:11,370
whew okay does it support HP sorry so

426
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,909
the question was can you use PHP or I

427
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:17,700
guess other languages behind the scenes

428
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,450
to kind of generate I mean I would say

429
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,990
in theory yes but the main process is

430
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:28,110
still a node process and you would have

431
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,760
to somehow figure out how to bundle

432
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,890
those dependencies as well that would

433
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:39,840
probably be the main and I don't know

434
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,750
how that would view it you know the user

435
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:43,770
would end up having a lot of running

436
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,149
processes that they're not necessarily

437
00:21:45,149 --> 00:21:47,669
aware of as well yeah that's the only

438
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:50,730
thing to bear in mind it's an

439
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,350
interesting idea I kind of know why

440
00:21:52,350 --> 00:22:00,679
you'd want to do it but yeah yeah node

441
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:07,320
does a lot okay I think the guy at the

442
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,970
back was just there slightly earlier

443
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:20,690
yeah so the question was with the

444
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,520
framework can you can more than one

445
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,560
application use it or can you customize

446
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,440
it in some way multiple applications

447
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,510
accessing it I'm not sure it probably

448
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,640
depend on the operating system but for

449
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:38,980
example the slack application which is

450
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:42,440
at least based around electron isn't as

451
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,130
big and it's reasonably complicated so

452
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:50,900
oh okay it used to be smaller last time

453
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:56,900
a last time I looked but still that is

454
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,870
smaller then it could be so I think and

455
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,940
if you crack that open it's slightly

456
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,260
different inside so they've done

457
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:07,690
something to streamline it a bit so yeah

458
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,010
yeah I think you could probably strip

459
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,450
out the bits of the framework you're not

460
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:15,580
using and things like that yeah yeah

461
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,250
is electronic kind of like they're in

462
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,530
the same way you might say like your

463
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:32,890
main

464
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:35,950
yeah can you make electronics

465
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:40,000
progressive impossible okay yeah I'm

466
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,010
gonna say yes or no because based on

467
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,470
examples I've seen so for example what

468
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,740
sorry so the question was around like

469
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,900
progressive application development can

470
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,310
I make a website version that is

471
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,570
basically the same as a desktop version

472
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:55,150
etc whereas with PhoneGap you couldn't

473
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,190
really do that so for example if you

474
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:59,410
look at slack in the browser and snack

475
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,480
on the desktop it looks pretty much the

476
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,840
same but I have hung around in I

477
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,190
wondered the same thing with Adam I

478
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,990
thought hey could you make Adam on the

479
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:12,120
web and the forum post there said no so

480
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:20,200
so it depends what you're doing yeah

481
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,440
so in theory yes because I'm pretty sure

482
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,160
slack is basically the same there's a

483
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,200
few extra preferences you get in the

484
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,030
desktop and they do vary per platform

485
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,830
like what you want to do and things like

486
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,020
that but I would set pretty strongly say

487
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,060
yes and it's kind of the point of it as

488
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:43,390
well okay and then over yes yeah each

489
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:46,770
time you every package

490
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:54,770
yeah you're like aware of so this is one

491
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:58,160
of the attractions I can say okay I know

492
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:06,230
exactly so the question was can you

493
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:09,170
specify the chrome version because

494
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,490
actually then effectively have more

495
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:12,740
control that we do on the web again I

496
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,840
haven't tried it but I have seen

497
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,110
discussions around that and I don't see

498
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:21,260
why you couldn't I think would be by my

499
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:34,280
encouraging answer to go and look I know

500
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,980
one of the weird things we're trying to

501
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,230
get around with was sort of exposing

502
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:43,370
files and interfaces to the app from the

503
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,140
native port so we have different

504
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:48,950
solutions but maybe yeah so the question

505
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:53,540
was about file access and so as far as

506
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,170
I'm aware because using atom for example

507
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:59,420
hi I've not noticed any restrictions

508
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:03,080
I get recent documents system-wide

509
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,060
I can access all the things I would

510
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:09,230
expect to have in my Mac OS that I can

511
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,960
do with native applications I can do so

512
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,600
for whatever magic is happening it's

513
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,960
giving me full access how exactly that

514
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,350
works

515
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:22,010
I'm not having percent sure but you do

516
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:25,180
get full access yeah

517
00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:31,250
so again through through not native

518
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:39,649
models yeah okay so you're saying

519
00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:44,240
certain system-wide libraries okay maybe

520
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,750
because you can for example services

521
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:50,960
which is a sort of Mac system library

522
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,269
you can access so some you can some you

523
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:56,179
can't and it's probably just because no

524
00:26:56,179 --> 00:26:58,279
one's written the bindings yet not

525
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:00,529
because it's impossible no it has it I

526
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:10,850
guess but yeah any okay so the question

527
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,769
was can you access can you execute

528
00:27:12,769 --> 00:27:17,149
system commands I'm gonna say yes

529
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:20,240
because in a term you can in actively

530
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,820
you can actually edit the init script to

531
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:27,490
execute system commands so yeah so I

532
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:44,450
would say yes or is that gonna break

533
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:46,039
your code by definition or is everything

534
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,690
guaranteed to still work in the next

535
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:49,429
version so the question was about

536
00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:52,410
breaking changes between versions

537
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:55,710
[Music]

538
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,470
I'm not a hundred percent sure about

539
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:01,289
breaking changes but for example I think

540
00:28:01,289 --> 00:28:04,230
1.3 1.4 for example fixed a lot of

541
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,669
problems with rendering on high

542
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:08,460
resolution screens so it's often they

543
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,169
seem to be mostly introducing new

544
00:28:10,169 --> 00:28:11,640
features that you can take and that you

545
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,470
have to take advantage of as opposed to

546
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,120
breaking old ones probably because it's

547
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,610
still quite new but I'm sure at some

548
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:20,130
point there will be they will start

549
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:23,669
breaking the pics at the moment I think

550
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:25,320
it's mostly just improving improving a

551
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,480
probably not taking much out but I'm

552
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,919
sure at some point something will start

553
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:31,140
breaking but again it's MPM so you can

554
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,529
specify the version so maybe time for

555
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:34,860
one more

556
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,158
yep

557
00:29:05,289 --> 00:29:10,490
so the question was about security to be

558
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:13,000
honest with you I don't have an answer I

559
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,320
feel like that would be a very obvious

560
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,960
question everyone would have had so I

561
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,240
feel like there's some kind of sandbox

562
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,730
in going on but I'm not hundred in sure

563
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:26,919
I would say check the documentation

564
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:30,019
because it seems too obvious not to have

565
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:33,830
thought about it in some way shape or

566
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,450
form although it's probably gonna still

567
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:38,690
be a little less secure than well badly

568
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,760
coded applications are still gonna read

569
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,100
native or not but yeah I'm not going to

570
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,169
percent sure but I mean probably the

571
00:29:45,169 --> 00:29:46,760
most dangerous thing immediately is just

572
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,260
taking over your system a bit from

573
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,029
performance but I would say check the

574
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:51,409
documentation I'm pretty sure there's

575
00:29:51,409 --> 00:29:53,769
going to be something covering that but

576
00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:57,909
thanks very much as I say

577
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:06,630
electrons is calm
