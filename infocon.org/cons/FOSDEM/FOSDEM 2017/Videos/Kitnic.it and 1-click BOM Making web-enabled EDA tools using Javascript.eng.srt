1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,210
so if you were here previously you know

2
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,400
my name is kasper and I'm an electronic

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,889
design engineer and software developer

4
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:17,210
this talk is well a web service and

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,009
browser extension that I worked I've

6
00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:21,800
been working on which is to make it

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,960
easier to replicate electronics projects

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,509
once their design is finished so I'd

9
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:30,710
like to give some context for the

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,790
motivation behind this and I grabbed

11
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,320
some statistics from various places

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,040
about to try and gauge the number of

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,030
electronic engineers they are in the

14
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,720
world and how that compares to software

15
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,850
developers so in the you know you can

16
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,250
look at these statistics here and kind

17
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,739
of guesstimate the amount of people

18
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:56,530
there in the world working on so on

19
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,760
electronic engineering versus software

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,750
and so kind of in summary there's about

21
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,920
one Yi to every 3d program is maybe and

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,770
then I was when you think about it

23
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,960
there's maybe you know 1 in 10 software

24
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,710
engineers know C and if you but if you

25
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,320
compare that kind of forums on

26
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,060
electronics versus C programming if you

27
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:24,499
just reduce the subset you you get quite

28
00:01:24,499 --> 00:01:26,570
favorable numbers into pitting for

29
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,119
electronics really and the question

30
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,640
really is where what why where's the

31
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,939
Linux of electronics and this is a lot

32
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:36,200
of people think about this is actually

33
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,929
logo from the open hardware repository

34
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:41,450
from CERN and I think it captures that

35
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,590
idea quite well you know where what why

36
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,689
isn't this happening and of course you

37
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:50,899
know it's not software and there's a lot

38
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:54,170
of labor and kind of physical movement

39
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:58,999
and things I have to happen for to make

40
00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:00,679
electronics happen but there's a lot of

41
00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:03,109
automation as well so this is a pick and

42
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:07,330
place machine which you know it's quite

43
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,850
advanced automation and board prices are

44
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,360
going down you can iterate as a design

45
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,800
engineer you can iterate quite quickly

46
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,620
on a hardware project

47
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,689
you it doesn't cost that much to make

48
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:21,980
her get a boat made anymore

49
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,709
and it's more accessible for everyone

50
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:26,569
and we do shake projects so I did a

51
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:28,010
survey a while back and there's about

52
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:31,129
3,000 Cod projects on github about 7,000

53
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:34,549
ego projects and ash Park which is a PCB

54
00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:36,739
batching service they have a kind of

55
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,120
little project they're sharing thing

56
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,799
where you can download Gerber's for four

57
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:41,959
projects there's about 9,000 projects on

58
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:44,060
there and there's all hackaday and

59
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,370
ee-vie blog forums and all these

60
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,060
different ways of sharing projects I

61
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,019
think and it's an interesting problem to

62
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:58,730
to look at I think and I think part of

63
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,950
the problem is maybe we have a heritage

64
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:05,120
of doing very amazing things but not

65
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,639
making it so understandable for other

66
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:11,209
people to replicate that this is a

67
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:14,359
picture from oh I didn't run down

68
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:15,650
the reference I think it's at the end is

69
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,750
Bob it's Bob peas I can't remember the

70
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:22,849
title of the book but and so my my kind

71
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:25,040
of approach to this was we want to have

72
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,569
all these different way of doing things

73
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:29,560
like the Chi card and all the different

74
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,180
ways of sharing things and all the ways

75
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,540
of different ways of making PCBs and

76
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,739
kind of munch it all up and at the end

77
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:37,909
of it what do you really want you want

78
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:40,579
the PCB and you want the parts to make

79
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:46,699
the PCB so my approach to this is the

80
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:49,970
kidney kit website which is a project

81
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,540
sharing website and the one-click bill

82
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,729
of materials browser extension which

83
00:03:55,729 --> 00:03:58,699
works in your browser to replicate

84
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:01,220
replicate web requests to try and

85
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,079
automate automatically put things into

86
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:07,040
retailer shopping carts so this is the

87
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,840
one trick one browser extension that was

88
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,250
first presented at first I'm actually in

89
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,430
2015 and it's still it's still there

90
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,690
still works it automates purchasing by

91
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,839
replicating the web requests are sent to

92
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,070
use retailer sites so it currently works

93
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,770
for digi-key Mauser RS New York Farnell

94
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,380
element14 and you might ask why why does

95
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,370
this need to be a browser extension

96
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,980
can't you just make a website that

97
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,340
he puts things into carts well not

98
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,200
really and there's some exceptions to

99
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,140
this but basically the the retailer

100
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,830
website would have to allow pretty much

101
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,810
you your specific website or you to do

102
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:52,010
this so this is a quote from the same

103
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,590
origin Percy is what is implemented in

104
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,020
browsers basically to prevent one site

105
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,700
from messing with your data on another

106
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,870
site and there's a good little comic

107
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,750
about that but I'm not sure see me now's

108
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,580
a good time favorite reason I'm not sure

109
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,070
what I put the hem there but I'm going

110
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,340
to skip it so this you can you can look

111
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,540
up the slides and look at that coming

112
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,450
it's a quite it's cute this is the kind

113
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,360
of request you have to send for what is

114
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,550
this the Mauser site to add something to

115
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,410
your cart and there's quite a lot of

116
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,150
stuff in there and maybe you don't

117
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:29,000
strictly need but there

118
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,800
the crucial thing actually is this

119
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,710
viewstate element which goes on

120
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,700
thousands and thousands of bytes for

121
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,800
some reason and you need to send that to

122
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,020
its to to modify the user's cart so in

123
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,490
the in the the way I kind of handle this

124
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,770
this complexity of all these different

125
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,600
retailers all the different countries

126
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,910
and these kinds of the kind of lengthy

127
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,130
requests is I use a lot of testing and

128
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,080
make sure that it works across all the

129
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,950
different sites and all the different

130
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,730
countries but with using this

131
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:05,150
integration testing so this one's a test

132
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,710
for funnel and it checks for each

133
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,260
country that can add some parts to the

134
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,960
car checks the cart and you can empty it

135
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,660
and if there's a failure if there's

136
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,330
something fails it'll notice and also if

137
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:21,110
but it won't like it often the way the

138
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,790
retailer sites work is it if something

139
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,040
fails it'll be in your cart for you to

140
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,610
see but really it it if you if you want

141
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,260
the extension to work that you should be

142
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,870
able to clear that out again and try the

143
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,090
next operation so this is what the

144
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,320
extension looks like and it's kind of

145
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,910
meant to be used in conjunction whether

146
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,010
with the spreadsheet on one side and you

147
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,190
can copy from the spreadsheet into the

148
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,479
extension and

149
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,330
and copy out of the extension back into

150
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,409
the spreadsheet so they're there five

151
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:53,659
retailers are currently supported and

152
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:57,740
you can add to the cart and empty the

153
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:04,969
cup so this is available for Chrome and

154
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:06,860
Firefox currently it works on

155
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,360
tab-separated values which is the

156
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,669
clipboard format for spreadsheets you

157
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:12,199
can also load an online bomb so if you

158
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:15,289
share below materialism on github or

159
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:17,060
somewhere in the right format you can

160
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,270
just load it directly into the extension

161
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,159
it can I've been working on features

162
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:25,699
where it can try and complete like if

163
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:27,199
you if you give it a description for a

164
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,120
part it will try and find the right path

165
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,879
for you it'll be more on that later it's

166
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:33,580
open source

167
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,069
Cpl license ever and it has about 500

168
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:45,439
users so back to this kind of a weird

169
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:49,479
analogy here we have a way of

170
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:52,189
replicating purchases from one person to

171
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:56,389
the other and you can do that across the

172
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:59,120
globe but it doesn't include the PCBU

173
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,839
necessarily and there's no neat way to

174
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:05,120
package everything together so this is

175
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,639
kind of what the kit nigut website is

176
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:15,560
for and the way that works is you put

177
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,249
everything into a git repository you use

178
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,529
the format that the extension

179
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:23,479
understands and the website understands

180
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:25,639
as well which is that one click tab

181
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,830
separate values you need a leaf

182
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,599
references quantity and a power number

183
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,360
two kind of that's like the minimum that

184
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,250
you should be able to specify about your

185
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,578
project and we use r27 4x Gerber's and

186
00:08:37,578 --> 00:08:39,649
excellent drills and so this is kind of

187
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:41,059
the minimum file tree that you would

188
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:42,948
have you have you have the TSV and the

189
00:08:42,948 --> 00:08:49,399
Gerber files so we're going to try and

190
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:52,760
do a live preview of the website

191
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:59,750
oh right yeah here we go

192
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:06,589
one second

193
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:19,100
so that's the front page

194
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:25,480
and there's a where's my scrollbar hmm

195
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,920
I'm sure that's not the websites fault

196
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:37,130
how do I screw on this have you know one

197
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,440
page down will always work great here we

198
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,380
go okay so these are some projects that

199
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,610
are on there ready we can make me select

200
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:51,230
one so it's a small FM transmitter kind

201
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:54,260
of demo project so it's got a nice

202
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,970
rendering of the Gerber files and it's

203
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:02,029
got a link here to get service there's

204
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:04,820
links here okay short descriptions and a

205
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,770
website link for more info and the

206
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:10,520
repository link and here is kind of the

207
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,620
magic where you need the browser

208
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,050
extension except in some instances I've

209
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,140
actually found that digi-key is enabled

210
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,620
cause requests to add parts completely a

211
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:26,089
new arc and fernell as well except the

212
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:28,089
extension kind of works better because

213
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:31,910
there's less friction in doing so you

214
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:37,010
won't be prompted for decisions for like

215
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,510
for New York you might be prompted to

216
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,730
make a decision on whether you want to

217
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,610
buy more parts for less money which you

218
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,750
don't really want to be prompted for

219
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,430
that so that's lit it's even less still

220
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,050
less friction with New York if you extol

221
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,839
the extension and for we did UK if you

222
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:52,790
install the extension and in new I can

223
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,920
find out that the way the extension

224
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,620
works it adds all the all the references

225
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,070
line notes to your to your shopping cart

226
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,930
so that when you get the parts you will

227
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:07,190
normally have in the in the in the you

228
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:09,020
know the printer details there what

229
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,510
parts are what already so it's kind of

230
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:17,510
the idea really is to to have a transfer

231
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,130
without the creator necessarily having

232
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,650
put to put together a kit they can

233
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:25,040
transfer all the information you need to

234
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,529
buy your own kit without them having to

235
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:30,020
bag components and things that's really

236
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,530
the big idea

237
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:37,380
should we try and buy something mm-hmm

238
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,320
so this won't actually use the extension

239
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:49,960
so this prompts you like I said do you

240
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,750
want to buy more parts for less money

241
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:58,080
yes I would like to right

242
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,880
there we go and there's all the parts

243
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,410
you need and you can go and buy that so

244
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:17,440
what I added a few days ago here we are

245
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,110
I'm a bit confused sorry we're more

246
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:23,120
right so this is what I added a few days

247
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,640
ago is because previously the way we

248
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,200
handed handles submissions was you sent

249
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,080
a pull request to the gab repo where the

250
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,270
site is in a way all the site source

251
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,490
code is and there's a boards a text file

252
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,470
where you add your the lines your

253
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,510
publicly accessible git repository and

254
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:46,250
then if everything looks ok then I'll

255
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,260
add that to the main branch the master

256
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,880
branch and the whole site is rebuilt

257
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,520
with your project in it so now I added

258
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,410
this a few days ago and you can try and

259
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,420
instead of you know just blindly going

260
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,820
does this work does this work you can

261
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,360
now get a kind of a better idea by doing

262
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,040
a preview so this is the kind of Arduino

263
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,010
example project and then renders the

264
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,230
thing for you and you can change the

265
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:21,650
color but they still they still know

266
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,540
there's still no accounts on the site or

267
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,150
anything so you still have to go by the

268
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,350
end of all of this if you've checked

269
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,360
everything seems to be in the right

270
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,870
place and there's the readme file and

271
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,540
the links and things then by the end of

272
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:40,280
it please send us a pull request so

273
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:44,380
there's still a lot of work to do there

274
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,140
no work maybe I've never seen that

275
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,200
anywhere so I'm not sure but right I'm

276
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,250
not sure how to get back to my

277
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:03,940
presentation all right

278
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:25,160
I don't think Mike even okay hey right

279
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:36,390
now this my okay so yeah like I said the

280
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,400
idea is really this virtual kit you

281
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,050
don't have to lift a finger you can

282
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,520
transfer all the information you need

283
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,760
through this through the website the way

284
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:49,500
it works right yeah the way it works we

285
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,390
use static site hosting for the moment

286
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,740
minute we I used continuous integration

287
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,260
to build the site and to kind of preview

288
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,580
you've seen me messing about with these

289
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,140
preview domains let's actually a branch

290
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,030
on there so whenever I make a branch and

291
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,970
I push it up to get up it'll build it'll

292
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:09,810
deploy it to my AWS server so I can have

293
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,070
a look at the side end and I can show

294
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:15,330
other people what's going on there and

295
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:18,480
like him I already went over this so

296
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,880
there's a lot of planned features really

297
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,380
it would be nice to add accounts and

298
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,430
have a management feature and have file

299
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,260
uploads and not necessarily force

300
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,450
electronic engineers to use git and

301
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:36,360
really I quite enjoy making tools that

302
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,810
help make Bills of materials I'm gonna

303
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,070
skip over this because I'm running out

304
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:41,580
of time

305
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,590
this would be a nice feature if you

306
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,350
could like to help you build the kit

307
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,550
even if you hover over somewhere you can

308
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,500
see we're on the boards with this is

309
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,330
kind of a philosophy that I take when

310
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:55,470
when implementing this is and like to

311
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:58,020
build them the the minimum thing that

312
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,660
could be useful and then to add on top

313
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,920
of that instead of trying to build the

314
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,579
whole thing at once

315
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,150
yeah that's a good question like I said

316
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:12,740
there's already caused requests there's

317
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,570
some pros and cons you can read up on

318
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:18,100
that oh that's supposed to be a nice

319
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:23,360
thing right um I guess the question for

320
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,680
me as well is how do I make this

321
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,290
development sustainable really there's a

322
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,360
lot of so far there's a lot of expenses

323
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,660
and there's there's some potential to

324
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,990
track referrals in the site and try and

325
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,750
try and make money of that and to

326
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,850
support the verb development or the

327
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,400
potential to you know add paid private

328
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,530
accounts and have people pay a

329
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:49,190
subscription to support or maybe some

330
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,530
other donation mechanism to support the

331
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:55,850
development write some code I don't

332
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,380
think I have a lot of time for the code

333
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,530
are there any questions at this point

334
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:07,670
yeah yes it would be possible very much

335
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,819
so I'm gonna continue sorry I shouldn't

336
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:12,800
have it's all JavaScript

337
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,690
everything's JavaScript I'm gonna I'm

338
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:15,740
going to come back to questions

339
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:23,720
afterwards initially if you look at the

340
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,280
old presentation it was CoffeeScript and

341
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,170
I've stopped using that to get advanced

342
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,620
features JavaScript features because

343
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,370
CoffeeScript was kind of getting in the

344
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:35,360
way where we still compile JavaScript to

345
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:42,500
JavaScript brilliant so the kidney

346
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,140
insight uses react as the front-end it's

347
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,110
kind of this this view layer made by

348
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,170
Facebook where you define lots of

349
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,680
different small modules you pretty much

350
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,380
writing HTML you get JavaScript to

351
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,480
always generate HTML for you instead of

352
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,700
getting JavaScript to manipulate HTML

353
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,770
for you so it does one pass and it

354
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,750
renders it and that's your static site

355
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:10,430
and then it uses this react front-end to

356
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:13,340
modify that I started building out micro

357
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,870
services and making use of micro

358
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,820
services so that what you saw there

359
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,770
their preview thing I've made a project

360
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:19,850
out of that it's a

361
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,890
it's kind of a little service where you

362
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,470
can put in a URL for a get repository

363
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,180
and it will serve all the files to you

364
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:30,290
so I think I want to continue to split

365
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,000
out little projects like this that could

366
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,150
be generally useful and open system this

367
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,860
is not my own thing I make use of this

368
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,170
for geolocation but that's another

369
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:42,230
service that's running for to support

370
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:48,200
kipnuk like I had a lot of things to say

371
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,540
about JavaScript which are probably one

372
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,290
at a time for but pretty much the gist

373
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,260
of it is that it's it's there's a lot of

374
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,550
bad things to say about JavaScript but

375
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,920
the ecosystem is pretty amazing right

376
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,230
now it is the people make little tiny

377
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,570
packages for everything so there's even

378
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,780
a package to left pata string that's one

379
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,210
JavaScript package that you can you can

380
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,830
include in your post and there was a bit

381
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,620
of controversy around this because the

382
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,770
person that was in charge of this remove

383
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,660
this from the repositories and it broke

384
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,950
a lot of important projects so there's

385
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,990
that you know upsides and downsides this

386
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,850
this is an amazing library that we make

387
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,920
use of a kitnik it's bit written by

388
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,650
Micheal cousins and it renders gabber

389
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:36,290
files using javascript it will work in

390
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:40,100
the browser it will work in on no Jess

391
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,440
in the backend and those are kind of the

392
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,830
dependencies that it has but Michael

393
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:48,200
cousins written all of this and want one

394
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,060
kind of neat thing that we've done well

395
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,950
we've collaborated on is what's that go

396
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,570
where which kind of takes all these

397
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,160
different ways of naming Gerber files

398
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,410
and and tries to figure out what the

399
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,920
stack up is and make the right

400
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:07,310
we were rendering right more codes I'd

401
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:12,530
plan to show you where I made use of NPM

402
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:16,940
packages to to make this feature which I

403
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,060
will skip ahead to and it's kind of

404
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,980
combined with the CPL data from octopod

405
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:27,050
so is it thing it does a quick look up

406
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:30,280
from your description

407
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:35,719
yeah I shoulda put me

408
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,780
so you kind of give it a description

409
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,190
paste that in there and press complete

410
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,210
and it figures out what parts you wanted

411
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,770
just from the description and this is

412
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,180
especially good for kind of generic

413
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:53,950
components if oh these are not actual

414
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,980
Windows Phone and you can put that back

415
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,140
into your spreadsheet or go and buy that

416
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:04,540
with the extension so I'd like to work

417
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,120
more on things like that to make making

418
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,740
Bills of materials easier right now this

419
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,630
is a bit like a self-driving car with

420
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,430
just one button you've got no control

421
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,500
you can just say complete and then you

422
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,360
have to check over all the mess that it

423
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:26,370
could potentially make so on my own time

424
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,050
three minutes ago I should have finished

425
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:47,200
including questions so I'm done right we

426
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:54,850
any questions yes yes there's I mean I

427
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:57,130
mean not like concrete plans but that

428
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:03,690
seems like a great feature to have yeah

429
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:26,460
so the question was why not generate

430
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:39,370
work file sorry yeah yeah yeah because

431
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,530
it varies so much across retailers so

432
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,450
what we have what I'd like is to have

433
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,549
the same way to do it across all the

434
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:47,530
different retailers and always this kind

435
00:22:47,530 --> 00:23:06,940
of always the same steps yeah yeah it's

436
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,320
the it's it's it's actually the

437
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,520
clipboard format and it's just

438
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,230
tab-separated values so it'll work with

439
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:26,080
any spreadsheet multiple yeah multiple

440
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,880
vendor alternatives are currently not

441
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,679
supported in the format the only thing

442
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,390
that is support is multiple manufacturer

443
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:33,340
part numbers on the bill materials so

444
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,250
you can say the all these parts are

445
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,039
possible to be used here and then there

446
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,390
you have a selection for specific

447
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:54,130
retailer yeah exactly that so you can

448
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,409
have multiple manufacturer part number

449
00:23:56,409 --> 00:23:58,059
manufacturer part number in your bill of

450
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:00,880
materials and then you could have us the

451
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,549
you could have a selection of one of

452
00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:07,200
those for your retailer columns

453
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:27,740
the operation today on not atomic no you

454
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:31,130
pretty much you I've only tested this

455
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,680
doing one retail at a time and it won't

456
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,080
the website won't currently let you do

457
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,180
more try and add more components while

458
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,760
the other components already being added

459
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,050
but you can have quite large Bills of

460
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:45,520
materials so you can all add at once

461
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,320
well it would be quicker if you all did

462
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:09,910
it if you did it as one requests yeah

463
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,260
that's the trouble trying to validate

464
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,960
and making sure that it's it's correct

465
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:26,849
[Applause]
