seconds we don't yet you're fast readers

00:00:43,769 --> 00:00:48,119

16
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:56,100
four so let me just give you some

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,519
background

18
00:00:56,519 --> 00:01:01,140
what is this JDK nine outreach for jdk

19
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,049
age we wanted to make sure that we

20
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,240
didn't have the same situation when JDK

21
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,060
7 when GA and we had issues almost

22
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,299
immediately thanks to who we add Apache

23
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:16,140
loosin so we wanted to go out and talk

24
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,479
to the community at large and say come

25
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,850
and work with us download our early

26
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,249
access bills test them as let us know

27
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:27,810
what issues you find so the first person

28
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,399
we approach was ooey and he was

29
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:32,219
delighted to come aboard and suggested

30
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:34,859
others that might be of the same frame

31
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:41,159
so before JDK 8 actually shipped we

32
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,020
actually got some like 20 open source

33
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,520
community members to actually projects

34
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,159
to come and talk to us and work with us

35
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:53,159
downloading and logging bunks at the

36
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,740
moment we're up to a hundred and one

37
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,380
we've just broken through the 100

38
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,600
projects so we are communicating the

39
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,850
changes that are in early access bills

40
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,789
to over a hundred open source projects

41
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:13,080
I'd love to know if any of you guys have

42
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,730
ever heard of me before coming in here

43
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,210
and actually had received emails on

44
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,819
device main

45
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:20,620
lists or anything that you see me

46
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,569
annoyingly sending out these emails all

47
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:26,920
the time anybody one yes sounds great

48
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,239
okay it's me okay it's all my fault

49
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:34,859
okay so so this is a continuous process

50
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:38,260
and in the last 16 months we've added 18

51
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,650
new and actually we've added 20 because

52
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,959
another two came in in the last two

53
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:46,150
weeks since these slides were actually

54
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,060
created and one of the great things that

55
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,150
we measure is how this is how successful

56
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,709
we are but this is the number of bumps

57
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:57,489
that are coming in from the community in

58
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:02,199
the last year we've had 60 new 64 issues

59
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:05,349
loved and I'll show you how some of

60
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:06,370
these break down into different

61
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,269
priorities and components and stuff so

62
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:14,139
in total since we actually started it's

63
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:16,810
a hundred and seventy-three bugs have

64
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,120
actually been logged and I see lots of

65
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,500
phases here of the people who have

66
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,209
actually logged those bugs so it's great

67
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:27,699
to see you here it's so simple to

68
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:29,620
actually join I would like to recommend

69
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,479
it to every single one of you here today

70
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:34,569
this is something that you will we give

71
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:36,609
you information about what's going into

72
00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:39,639
the latest build and changes that might

73
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,560
break you and advise you okay if you're

74
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,329
doing this you need to test on this

75
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:46,299
particular build so all you have to do

76
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:48,269
is send a mail to the quality discuss

77
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,769
OpenJDK or you can send a mail to me as

78
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:54,579
well if you prefer and the great thing

79
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:56,530
is what you can't really read this but

80
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,970
if you if that was a little bit clearer

81
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,919
you would see that stefan bought a vague

82
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,099
from apache ant i had being annoying him

83
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:05,049
for so long to come and join us and he

84
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:06,909
was actually doing testing but he didn't

85
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:09,099
want his stuff listed externally because

86
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:10,900
he thought everybody would be annoying

87
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,120
him so eventually he sent me an a and

88
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,879
they'll either 8 a.m. in the morning and

89
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:19,149
by 10 minutes past 8 I hadn't listed on

90
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:23,820
the OpenJDK quality external page so I

91
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,080
can't guarantee every time that I'm

92
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,400
going to get you listed within 10

93
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,710
minutes but I will you know I will do my

94
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,820
best to get you on there

95
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:39,180
now these are the guys who are this is

96
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,249
just five but these are the guys that

97
00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:44,490
love the most bugs and the highest

98
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,870
quality bugs in the last six months

99
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,550
number one Apache loosen and that's

100
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,050
usually Hui Apache Tomcat came in with

101
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,020
six bugs in a row just together just

102
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,169
here you go six boats thank you really

103
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:03,240
really you know this is what actually

104
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,449
helps us to make sure and improve the

105
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:08,219
quality of the release that we actually

106
00:05:08,219 --> 00:05:13,349
release at GA time so thank you to these

107
00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:15,300
guys they've done a sterling job they

108
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,339
you know it makes our life so much

109
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:20,639
better and when the books come in

110
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,099
Delabar and I will make sure that they

111
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:26,729
you know and these bugs are given the

112
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:31,439
proper viewing by the right people so we

113
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:33,210
try to get them because we know the

114
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,830
quality of the bugs coming in from the

115
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,810
people are absolutely first-class

116
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:43,289
and need to be fixed now just give you

117
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:46,469
an idea of the overall from from the

118
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:49,080
when we started this so we a hundred and

119
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,599
seventy-three bugs have been logged as I

120
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:55,229
mentioned lovely to see that we have

121
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:58,020
zero unresolved p-one and p-two bugs

122
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,719
from the loads that are come in from the

123
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:03,330
commuting we still have fourteen three

124
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,219
threes that we have to work on so that's

125
00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:08,099
work in progress but you can see here

126
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:12,270
that we fixed 94 or sorry 96 of these so

127
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,979
they're obviously bugs that we

128
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:16,710
interpreted as being high quality needed

129
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,539
to be fixed before we actually shipped

130
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:22,139
the product out so thank you again for

131
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,919
logging all these bugs so that's my

132
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,710
priority now if you looked in at the

133
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,490
different components when if you were to

134
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,099
look at a similar graph whereas this 12

135
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:37,139
months ago he would have seen that hot

136
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,089
spot was the one that was getting the

137
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:42,050
most bugs

138
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:45,329
client and core libs have caught up very

139
00:06:45,329 --> 00:06:47,789
much so in the last while so they have a

140
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:50,969
total of 46 and 23 whereas hotspot still

141
00:06:50,969 --> 00:06:53,939
is just up there with 51 but what we can

142
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:56,159
see is that you know the the number of

143
00:06:56,159 --> 00:07:04,799
bugs is actually going down and with

144
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:09,589
that I'm going to hand over to my Abel

145
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:16,499
that's wonderful so before I get started

146
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:18,179
with the slides right that's the boring

147
00:07:18,179 --> 00:07:20,819
part what we usually do here is we have

148
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:22,709
a governing board session afterwards and

149
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,419
these guys drinking beer and there are

150
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,669
five governing board members I bought

151
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:29,219
six beers so what I'm gonna do is I'm

152
00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:32,429
gonna give one beer out to one of yous

153
00:07:32,429 --> 00:07:35,099
whose project signs up for this quality

154
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:37,619
outreach stuff on quality - disgust at

155
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:40,619
hope adjudicate java.net by the end of

156
00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:43,619
this talk right so get on it and then

157
00:07:43,619 --> 00:07:45,689
come back later get a beer and now we

158
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:48,509
can go over the slides so the thing

159
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,939
about nine is of course we've been doing

160
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:53,279
this for a while and the one question

161
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:56,549
people ask me a lot about nine is does

162
00:07:56,549 --> 00:07:57,899
anybody really care about nine yet

163
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:00,119
aren't people just moving up to eight

164
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:02,699
like this average stuff the developers

165
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:05,009
really want to know about this stuff and

166
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:09,449
so what do we do well worry since a lot

167
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:11,399
of emails so there is that but a

168
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:13,079
question is you know do do other

169
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:15,059
projects care the people already filed

170
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:17,159
box against issues in line on their own

171
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:19,349
this is something happening there so one

172
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:20,789
way to look at this is looked at their

173
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:22,739
main list traffic through archives like

174
00:08:22,739 --> 00:08:25,679
mark mail and just search for subpoena

175
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:28,619
and we find Rory a lot of times right

176
00:08:28,619 --> 00:08:30,749
this guy is sending out a lot of email

177
00:08:30,749 --> 00:08:32,250
and getting a lot of replies back too

178
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,860
which is good but you also find that if

179
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,870
you look at how that's developed the

180
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,399
past couple years when I started out

181
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,019
there were like a thousand messages

182
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,568
across various projects in Apache and

183
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:46,110
Eclipse and so forth this is ground six

184
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,389
fold in the last two years in part

185
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:50,730
because we have worked diligently to get

186
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,290
more projects to sign up and participate

187
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,710
and they spread the word

188
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,410
and more importantly if you compare the

189
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:00,650
this to where we wear with JDK 8 a 1

190
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:04,910
year before it's J we were you know more

191
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,920
than double today in terms of jetting

192
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,050
down traffic outside of interest then

193
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,120
we're at the time of 8 at the same time

194
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,760
and if you look at how encouraging you

195
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,410
know the community reaction was to eight

196
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,180
how much people people cared about

197
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,590
getting their self to work with a I

198
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:21,170
think this is a really good you know

199
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,770
data point to look forward to so next

200
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,440
slide please

201
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,210
now the other data point to look forward

202
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,750
to is that you know one thing is to try

203
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,280
to extract random data of the Internet

204
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,350
the other is to just ask people directly

205
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,780
so in this outreach effort we have this

206
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,650
project participating so what we did

207
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:45,290
about two years before Jia won this this

208
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,480
autumn was to this short serving and

209
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,690
just to ask the participating projects

210
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,270
you know if they're testing at all how

211
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:56,620
far along they are what their you know

212
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:00,320
success is and so we had about a half of

213
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,910
the projects that participate in Kauai

214
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,540
cartridge

215
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,290
came back to us filled out a survey

216
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,750
around 90 percent actually tried already

217
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,350
to build the project with nine and had

218
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:17,750
some success and about 86 percent plan

219
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,880
to support nine within the first year of

220
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,210
the release of JDK nine and I think this

221
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,070
is really really a good piece of data to

222
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,530
have because if you if you look at the

223
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,290
talks you know like us and so forth

224
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,270
there is work to be done I work to be

225
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,830
done on the JDK so of course to make

226
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,690
sure that we have a great release work

227
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,460
to do bound to be done on a bunch of

228
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,720
libraries to make sure they work really

229
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,640
well with nine but there is also a

230
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,930
willingness in the community to

231
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,340
participate in this and I think this is

232
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,650
a great great thing to have it's a great

233
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:50,800
community were part of next slide and so

234
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,940
to give you some examples of the things

235
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,910
we've we've done in the past year

236
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,990
like I said Rory saying I'll send out

237
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,610
these emails tells people about the

238
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,040
builds tell us what's in them and then

239
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,140
hopefully some of them will try things

240
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,200
out let us know about things that break

241
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,000
and Rory mentioned that Tomcat project

242
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,950
was very active in giving us similarly

243
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:14,260
good bugs to work with so for example

244
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,290
Mark Thomas submitted an issue JDK

245
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:20,230
something or other about the default

246
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,450
behavior of your connection which was to

247
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,190
use caching and that turned out to be

248
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,950
problematic in particularly on Windows

249
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,840
or when you're using jar your

250
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,240
collections you may have having

251
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,120
descriptor leaks or you know fast may

252
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,550
end up dead locking and so he made a

253
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,800
suggestion there was a discussion first

254
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,510
between us where we try to figure out

255
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,550
this is something that we can resolve

256
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:46,230
between us already then the discussion

257
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,190
upon a suggestion was carried over to

258
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,960
the core lips - their main list in open

259
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,050
JDK and their Markey and members of the

260
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,390
jdk team discussed various ways to

261
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,850
address the problem it was finally

262
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,980
resolved by adding an API for this by I

263
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,040
think Michael a man while maintaining

264
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,020
the current behavior so that existing

265
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,430
code that relies on this doesn't break

266
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,800
so there's new API for this since Java 9

267
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,790
there's a Get Set default use caches in

268
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:16,240
Java natural connection and this is just

269
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,830
one example of the kind of interactions

270
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,780
we have with developers participating

271
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,600
projects it's not all just box they find

272
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,570
it's also extensions they need is those

273
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,010
are things they find that should be

274
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,080
working better in a future release where

275
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,280
they need functionality it isn't there

276
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:35,680
yet next please another example for

277
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,380
example is with ant as Suba mention his

278
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,290
talk the Apache ants team has actually

279
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,640
done a really good job of getting their

280
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,490
code to work and pass all the tests with

281
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:49,120
nine and then it turned out of course

282
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,890
that it had one month much more problem

283
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:55,870
and usually we can help with the simple

284
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,730
stuff where people forgets to set their

285
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,800
release flag or whatever if we can't

286
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,300
help directly we direct them to the

287
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,250
right mailing list which also can be

288
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,140
challenging because their main listen

289
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,230
open JDK for stuff like this

290
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:12,190
in this case Stefan was having one

291
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:16,270
testing and that was failing due to well

292
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,220
the things people do you know

293
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,220
reflection trickery to get at internal

294
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,670
API in XML posit to do something or

295
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,080
other and of course we cannot with

296
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,210
modules that doesn't work anymore so

297
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,760
what are you gonna do well you can

298
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,840
complain you can write a blog post you

299
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,060
can tweet angrily or you can go to core

300
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,580
leaves there and that's what he did and

301
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,680
said you know I would like to find a

302
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,790
good way to solve this

303
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,410
and so there was a thread on core Lib

304
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:46,360
step which went on for unix-like for you

305
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,120
know for a few weeks

306
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,490
right they wanted to use an excellently

307
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,200
pass from within eclipse will ask your

308
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,740
manager how they make this work it was

309
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,600
resolved with a couple of weeks with a

310
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,640
change both in a JDK where turn out to

311
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,550
have to be a bug in our implementation

312
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,490
of the XML functionality and also by

313
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,990
making some small adjustment to the test

314
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,700
code in Apache and so that's the other

315
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,530
thing we you know we try to work with

316
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,270
with community projects to make sure

317
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,810
that their code gets better as well and

318
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:20,890
uses the new friction ID and then of

319
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,330
course there is more some of the project

320
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,070
we started to work with because we came

321
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,670
across you know their own efforts to to

322
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,900
get the code to work with nine like a

323
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,350
Patrick health side and Julian heinously

324
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,390
I think the the VP for that in the

325
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,550
Patrick when it started out they had

326
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,920
some challenges right we spoke we got

327
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,900
him on board and eventually you know

328
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:45,000
their stuff runs annoying happy about it

329
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,040
other projects are actually using the

330
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,350
soul moved to nine thing as a way to get

331
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,660
the users to move off old versions lock

332
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,350
for J who here uses apache log4j right

333
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:58,350
everybody uses a bachelor for j2 right

334
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:02,200
because we're using one one is kind of

335
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,890
end-of-life and so it's also broken on

336
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,990
nine due to new versioning changes and

337
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,360
so the log4j team has gone off and

338
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,850
contacted their users in apache to help

339
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,280
them to upgrade to move off lock for j1

340
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,890
with a more current version that works a

341
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,360
nine of course

342
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,970
similarly other projects that we are in

343
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:25,680
touch with in the same maven ecosystem

344
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,060
you have done a lot of good work over

345
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,800
the past year to make sure that the

346
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,030
functionality we provide

347
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,570
is actually supported by the tools

348
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,100
result a number of issues and made a

349
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,400
number of you know incremental releases

350
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,840
improving their their facilities to work

351
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:45,100
with the release itself and sometimes

352
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,380
this is sometimes a bit challenging

353
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,030
because what we try to do is we try to

354
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:52,080
sign up the projects from our side

355
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,770
approaching directly there are the most

356
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:58,300
popular ones and that sometimes also

357
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,760
means changing chasing down they say

358
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,630
Diaspora of google codes or of code

359
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,820
house of these various hosting sites

360
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,330
that if over time you know they manage

361
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,640
disappeared and finding out you know who

362
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,780
is still running these projects so we

363
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,610
can actually get them involved because

364
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,410
many of these things like cue dogs are

365
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,480
eventually dependencies that a bunch of

366
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,950
popular projects will depend on so we

367
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,020
want these dependencies to work with

368
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,240
nine and future releases and of course

369
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,750
we want your code to be part of this too

370
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:30,160
next slide

371
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,950
yeah awesome and so for us the question

372
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,210
now that 9 is you know getting close to

373
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:39,820
the end game and 10 is opening up what

374
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,520
do we do next so where do we go with say

375
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,320
JD King 10 outreach what should we be

376
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,830
looking at doing better and different

377
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:50,320
for the next release and with that I'd

378
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,110
like to open up for questions because I

379
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:57,630
think we have about seven more minutes

380
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,569
[Music]

381
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:35,809
so developers from both maven and Gradle

382
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:39,800
are in both there are of course for some

383
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,330
of them in some cases challenges in

384
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,150
graybles case there's some interesting

385
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,980
issues have cropped up because the

386
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,180
module system does restrict access to

387
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,070
private classes so there is for example

388
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:56,090
in Gradle there is one one

389
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,630
dimensionality that's there to be able

390
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:07,660
to set environment variables on demons

391
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:12,800
and to do that it goes into you know an

392
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,929
unmodifiable collection using so

393
00:18:14,929 --> 00:18:17,660
accessible of environment variables and

394
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,750
makes it modifiable again which is maybe

395
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,980
not something you should be doing right

396
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,200
but the thing is it's really a tricky

397
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,890
problem setting environment variables

398
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:31,550
under state jelly PC he's not as nice

399
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,020
and easy as it sounds

400
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,510
there's a wonderful manual page page in

401
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,280
joseon linux that's basically tells you

402
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,710
don't do this in military programs or

403
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,840
bad things will happen so this is an

404
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,490
example where you know the Gradle team

405
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,080
has look at issues they have with the

406
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,940
code and figure out if there is a better

407
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,250
way to do this if there is a different

408
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,130
way to implement punch 19 in 9 or if

409
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,390
this is something where we would need to

410
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,640
think about providing adequate

411
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,770
interfaces insulator release if we can't

412
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,470
do this you know at all right if the GFC

413
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,780
says you can't do this then that's a

414
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,170
problem for me even Robert from the

415
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:07,309
mainland team has been around here as

416
00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:09,230
well and they've been working on a

417
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,630
number of things I don't think that all

418
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,910
of their tests pass yet they don't if

419
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,150
you know

420
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,880
the issue right so we have a number of

421
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,309
things to go through to make you know

422
00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:28,260
things work as they as we hope they

423
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,740
should but what we're trying to do here

424
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,210
is create a channel between developers

425
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,250
of the major projects and the teams

426
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,049
working behind you know the scenes on

427
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:40,890
say JDK and direct memory mapping is who

428
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,840
we mentioned so that people who you know

429
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,460
work together can actually work together

430
00:19:44,460 --> 00:20:10,559
in open JDK yeah absolutely I mean

431
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,270
that's why that's what built tools and

432
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,039
low that libraries like that have been

433
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:17,220
you know our first kind of target to

434
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,890
reach out to we have since try to expand

435
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,960
this this coverage you know to cover

436
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,029
other areas of the JVM as well so we

437
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:24,960
have as we've seen before

438
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,940
a lot of good input from say Hoover and

439
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,679
these themes about hotspot issues we

440
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:30,360
have really good about core elaborates

441
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,820
issues areas where we would like to see

442
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,559
more projects come here say things like

443
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,510
job effects where we only have a few

444
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:39,360
project participants so far or

445
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,080
serviceability and and parts like that

446
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,230
so you know if you don't if you do this

447
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:49,320
though if you the all project that works

448
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,210
in these parts we would really welcome

449
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,190
you over here right to participate in

450
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,330
this and let us know about issues that

451
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:58,559
break if you do work on build systems

452
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,140
that are not maven Gradle and something

453
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:01,500
else

454
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,149
you're very welcome as well right

455
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:19,580
yeah there'll be a number of recent

456
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,340
changes in as Superman should bill 148

457
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,009
that have that's a bit of you know

458
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:26,600
struggle for a number of tools but I

459
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,669
think this will gradually get worked out

460
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:30,919
it would be very useful as well if you

461
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:32,840
could go to the quality outreach page

462
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,479
and look at the list see is there any

463
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:37,249
projects on there that are really

464
00:21:37,249 --> 00:21:38,989
missing that you think should be on

465
00:21:38,989 --> 00:21:40,999
there we'd love to and if there if you

466
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:42,590
have contacts we're more than happy to

467
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:58,029
go talk to them I don't think we do

468
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:23,010
have you talked to Apache Felix or or CI

469
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:28,280
framework people for Jada k9 built

470
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,800
pretty sure we talked to Apache Felix

471
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,480
I'm not entirely I can't remember off

472
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,980
the top of my head whether we got a

473
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:40,110
positive response or not so um we have a

474
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:43,140
kind of 50% if race we think when we go

475
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,090
out to people and ask them do they want

476
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:49,380
to join us it's like if we go out to 150

477
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,130
then we'll come back and say yes okay so

478
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,630
sometimes it's because we don't know the

479
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:57,030
actual you know the real person who

480
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,230
should be caught and we should be

481
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,750
contacting two so that's why it would be

482
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,950
really great if you guys could have a

483
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,170
look and see are we missing projects and

484
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,940
if you know of context that would really

485
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,430
help us tell your friends tell your

486
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,880
friends

487
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:21,650
tell where we have one person signed up

488
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:26,299
[Music]

489
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,810
