1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,700
all right welcome everybody thank you

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,160
for staying even our own dinnertime so

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,880
when X speaker is mr. Cedric Thomas the

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,769
floor is yours give a big hand to in

5
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:17,380
please

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:23,220
[Applause]

7
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,490
good afternoon my name is Cedric Thomas

8
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,110
I'm the executive director of the open

9
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,780
source organization the audibility open

10
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,519
source organizations we are celebrating

11
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:11,140
our 10th year this year is 17 in - 2017

12
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,940
we are in the path of civilization we

13
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,790
host project our mission is to develop a

14
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,979
code base of open-source projects these

15
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:20,960
projects are developed essentially by a

16
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,420
different type of communities from

17
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,240
mainly from Europe we run them we're not

18
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,430
a repository we are a community so it's

19
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,979
all run without governance and we have

20
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:33,470
members that pay the fees that keeps us

21
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,259
independent of course we come from free

22
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:38,750
software we make ours the four freedoms

23
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,990
that were designed defined like 30 years

24
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,800
ago and that makes the foundations of

25
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,990
what we do but we also realized that

26
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,950
free software through some devious ways

27
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,259
became commercial and free software

28
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:56,240
became commercial open source that's

29
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,550
reason why I want to cover these about

30
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,800
the value chain this is that's what

31
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,420
brought our interest for the value chain

32
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,729
and how we can support our project

33
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:07,399
become better project out there in the

34
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:09,380
market so what I'm going to cover this

35
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,040
afternoon right now it very quickly it's

36
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,630
what is the the value chain how we

37
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:19,930
understand it what is evaluating

38
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,000
readiness for market readiness what is

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,360
the that kind of evaluation how it works

40
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,010
then what happens in the opposite world

41
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,440
the the technologies and where we come

42
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,290
from how we've been doing this and then

43
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,300
also exactly a little bit of where we

44
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,640
are so really take it as sharing a

45
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,340
work-in-progress happy to discuss this

46
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,290
with you the job is far from being

47
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:45,500
finished so open source project in the

48
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,780
value chain these projects come all in

49
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,510
different flavours we have what we call

50
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,340
community projects that are more less

51
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,099
loosely coupled project with sometimes

52
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:58,670
uncertain sustainability we have

53
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,440
Enterprise projects that are really

54
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,140
supported by commercial companies behind

55
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,930
and there are real market product and

56
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,849
increasingly we have what we call

57
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:09,560
collaborative project that our R&D

58
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,879
projects many of which are supported and

59
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:16,579
funded by the European Commission so

60
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:18,829
most of them they want to address a

61
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:20,599
customer they all have a mission to be

62
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,609
used on the market and to address some

63
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:25,099
users or some customers but software is

64
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:28,519
only code and code is just text and what

65
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:30,260
you do with text you don't do much the

66
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,269
minute you want to do business with

67
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:34,700
software this software becomes a product

68
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,920
the minute you want to have a customer

69
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,040
with all this software or with the

70
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,680
services that come in software you we're

71
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,230
talking about a product but what makes a

72
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,180
product a product is not just the code

73
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,790
it's the code press everything that

74
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,459
makes it usable for for the end-user

75
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:55,400
roadmap documentation training support

76
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,310
expertise etc and that's where we see

77
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,780
the value chain that's what creates

78
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,120
value what creates value it's all this

79
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,129
is not just the code but it's the code

80
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:06,319
perhaps what you put around that makes

81
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,079
it actually usable by an average

82
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:11,449
customer not not another developer like

83
00:04:11,449 --> 00:04:13,669
you but somebody who's an average

84
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:16,099
decision maker who has to buy a product

85
00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:18,320
to run a business and what happened what

86
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,149
you when you look at the most projects

87
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:22,849
the many open-source project many of

88
00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:25,370
those you see rough codes on github they

89
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,860
are stuck upstream they missed all these

90
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,740
what is downstream what is between them

91
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,530
and the customer and that's what we call

92
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,810
the delivery challenge this is what we

93
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,820
want to address by evaluating the market

94
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,560
readiness of our projects we also have

95
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,880
we also have something a bit special

96
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,330
about open source is that what the

97
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,650
average decision-maker

98
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,599
they want to trust open source software

99
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:52,009
they want to make sure that they are

100
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:53,870
predictable they're not just like there

101
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,960
or something developed by hobby hobby

102
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,330
developers and who creates this value

103
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,270
what it's the ecosystem the ecosystem is

104
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,250
made of the contributors first those who

105
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,289
write the code of course but we also

106
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:08,570
have a systems integrators that make the

107
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:11,750
code and the software actually fit for a

108
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,630
specific business purposes we also have

109
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,159
what we call fiduciary services which

110
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,500
are specific organization that provides

111
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,660
administrative and fiscal or financial

112
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,850
services to this project we have the

113
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,730
those this nervous those that sell

114
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,050
distribution think of OpenStack

115
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,210
distributions Hadoop distributions Linux

116
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,160
distributions of course we also have the

117
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,410
users that are part of this of this

118
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,330
ecosystem they also contribute back to

119
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,190
the project and we have the open source

120
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,290
organizations and that's why we fit and

121
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,840
that's our our perspective and this is

122
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,390
why we we think we can bring something

123
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,220
to our project and we bring something in

124
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,169
three layers a technical infrastructure

125
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:53,390
we are focused on infrastructure

126
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:56,419
software so we invest a lot in Intel

127
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:58,340
computing and that's where we want to

128
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,680
take a take our project we also invest

129
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,620
in in governance and in quality and part

130
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,210
of the governance is the quality we have

131
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,040
this quality program that we call Oscar

132
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,260
this is where market readiness

133
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:13,640
evaluation fits and we also have and we

134
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,370
also have a marketplace and this is why

135
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,650
we want to have market ready projects

136
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,510
that we can provide to the marketplace

137
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,240
so evaluating market readiness and

138
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,040
maturity is something that comes from

139
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,100
long time the the mother of all

140
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,470
evaluations is what we call the

141
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,180
technology readiness level that's

142
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,590
something that was developed by the NASA

143
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,440
then reused by the Department of Defense

144
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,510
and the part of an energy and that

145
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,880
scales technologies from the bottom

146
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,610
where it's useless to the top where it's

147
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,590
very useful it's been exploited it's

148
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,600
it's in day to day mainstream operations

149
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,220
we when I was looking at that and

150
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,270
thinking what we could do for our

151
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,520
project I came across an investment

152
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,710
readiness level scale from an investment

153
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,530
company that applied the same approach

154
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,030
another one in terms of markets

155
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:05,720
evaluation is that one is that one where

156
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,419
they put the scale flat and from left to

157
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:12,050
right you have a business more business

158
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,490
or market perspective when you see the

159
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,110
difference kind of stakeholders from the

160
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,030
left or the right you start with the

161
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,530
basic research with govern labs in

162
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,960
academia and towards the to the left and

163
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,320
to the right you have public the the

164
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,510
large businesses and the product and the

165
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,780
red line here shows illustrates the the

166
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,250
amount of funding that is often

167
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:31,840
available

168
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,060
for some of the the project so that's

169
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,790
that's a perspective from evaluation but

170
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,440
there is another thing that we come from

171
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,410
which is evaluating open source projects

172
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,540
the evaluation of open source project is

173
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,910
a long comes from a long time long long

174
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:49,260
perspective there are dozens of tools

175
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,660
because available typically because the

176
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,030
open source projects run on open

177
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,340
platforms that generates scores of data

178
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,440
and there are lots of tools and

179
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,169
companies to analyze this this data and

180
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:04,389
we work with one of them who's been

181
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:06,370
there BTI I can mention them at an

182
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,560
eclair in the room but some of them are

183
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,530
doing very very very good jobs so for us

184
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,840
it started in 2007 with a European

185
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,110
project called Calypso that was mainly

186
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,790
academic that delivered something like

187
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,430
that which was a huge spreadsheet with

188
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,530
hundreds of questions to evaluate the

189
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:28,180
project so in 2010 we took Calypso and

190
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,070
other projects and other tools like

191
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,650
sonar like force ology and we decided

192
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,270
not to reinvent the wheel not to create

193
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,330
an assessment methodology but only to

194
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,400
make available those tools to our

195
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,219
project so that the users they look can

196
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:44,020
look at this data and have information

197
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,670
about the project so the project was not

198
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,709
anonymous we want to share and make them

199
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:49,450
transparent and share data with this

200
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:52,480
project with their users and we may with

201
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,300
we also reused what we had from the

202
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,370
Calypso open-source maturity model we

203
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,040
made it a little bit more user friendly

204
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,959
in 2012 we were we got involved into a

205
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,260
research project called riscos which had

206
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,270
another interesting perspective which

207
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,190
was to analyze orbitals project in terms

208
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,089
of risk analysis and risk management's

209
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:17,350
what's interesting about that is that it

210
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,540
really comes from the fact that opus was

211
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,700
becoming mainstream we had to deal more

212
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,100
and more with mainstream conventional

213
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,709
managers for whom open-source was

214
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:28,420
something a little bit evil was

215
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,880
dangerous so the purpose in terms of

216
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,130
risk was something that was interesting

217
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,720
from then the good thing here is that

218
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,089
talking about risk it takes the

219
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:40,180
information one step level-one one step

220
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,940
higher it's not just about data or just

221
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,110
information but it's more about

222
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,820
perspective understand

223
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,910
bringing meaning to the data in 2015 we

224
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,830
came across the Linux Foundation and the

225
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,770
core infrastructure initiative that was

226
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,420
launched after they felt the heartbeat

227
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:58,690
failure and we got involved with David

228
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:00,220
wheeler and we realized that we're doing

229
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,110
pretty much the same that pretty much

230
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,420
the same agenda except they were much

231
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,920
more pragmatic if you look at the first

232
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,600
list of things that we're checking that

233
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,040
we're checking whether the project add a

234
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,110
website which is something we're totally

235
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,690
overlooked so having done that here is

236
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,930
our approach we have a whole platform

237
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,910
which is called OCR now for open source

238
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,330
capability assessment radar that covers

239
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:27,340
many different aspects of projects it's

240
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,170
already in production so this is a

241
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,360
screenshot from our website for a given

242
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,240
project we have the result from over the

243
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,700
OMM the assessment you this is what you

244
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,770
can see for the proactive project we

245
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,840
have the facility data we have the

246
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,390
sonarqube analysis we have risk analysis

247
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,300
our risk models are public you can

248
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,980
change them you can adapt them to your

249
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,590
business needs and we publish we end up

250
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,900
with a market really the scorecard but

251
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,900
it's just a scorecard and it's not it's

252
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,600
not the technology readiness level thing

253
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,850
we we wanted to have so the work in

254
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:04,720
progress and the presentation no no this

255
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,340
is the most important one the working

256
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,200
progress is that we have lots of data

257
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,510
out there produced by many different

258
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,000
tools and we need to put them in a one

259
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,040
dimension scale that's what we're

260
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,390
working on at the moment the one

261
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:20,410
dimension scale is a series of different

262
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,830
scenarios and each stage of that scale

263
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,780
represents a different situation a

264
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,510
different scenario it's a synthesis work

265
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,800
that we're doing with our project

266
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,610
managers and that and that we planning

267
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,490
to really announce at our annual

268
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:40,800
conference in June that's all thank you

269
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:47,260
[Applause]

270
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,210
so I'm sorry to do it the second mic

271
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,190
isn't working but we can still take some

272
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,870
questions I'll just run the mic up and

273
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,850
down anybody else I see question up

274
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:16,850
there yeah we took you about the CIA and

275
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,550
the CIA is mainly but evaluating

276
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,770
security in the interpreter in the

277
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,530
software it's not only security when we

278
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:25,940
discussed with them we realized that the

279
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,380
where the scope was broader than

280
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,690
security so we also trying to add to

281
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:33,080
that the actually merge all the

282
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,850
different criteria we analyzed so that

283
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,850
we have a common standard and had

284
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,590
security maybe security we will not

285
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,840
cover we leave that as an option for

286
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,110
them

287
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,160
yeah

288
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,050
now I don't have that feedback of

289
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,060
whether companies have actually used

290
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,470
them to make decisions or whether

291
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,300
they're as influencing decisions what I

292
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,980
know is that users are looking at those

293
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,980
because we can we see the the the the

294
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:44,750
way the pages are our consulted what we

295
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,480
do we kind of reserve this for our

296
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,470
project

297
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:51,290
so no the report rate gets into the code

298
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,300
base and has access to all these

299
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,279
facilities and again I have to say it's

300
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,260
a co-production it's something that we

301
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,790
do for them but we expect the project

302
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,560
leaders to also do and contribute

303
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,959
because we understand that helps them

304
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,269
improve that project so we work together

305
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:07,660
on that

306
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,900
okay thank you so if there's no more

307
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,610
questions then I would like to wrap up

308
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,280
give a big hand to Cedric for a talk

309
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:30,350
[Applause]
