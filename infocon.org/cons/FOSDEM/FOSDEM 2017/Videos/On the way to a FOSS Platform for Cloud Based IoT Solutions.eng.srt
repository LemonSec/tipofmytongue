1
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,760
thanks for coming here so in the middle

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,450
we will have a little little demo just

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,460
to show like some bits of it of course

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,110
like showing the entire platform would

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:20,220
take a lot of time so first I would like

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,550
to tell a little but why like the

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,810
industrial companies are really

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,300
interested in all these things maybe

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,310
it's obvious but why then doing it to

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,890
open-source and so software is becoming

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,890
the crucial element like everything is

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,350
going towards software for example today

13
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,780
in the automotive industry more and more

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,100
the innovations are coming from the

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,140
software part so for example in this

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,480
case there is saying roughly about 90%

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,290
is coming from the software part so it's

18
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,920
not yeah it's not a miracle that like

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,280
many voices out of the industrial

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,800
manufacturer companies are saying that

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,469
the things like that every industrial

22
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:04,780
company will become a software company

23
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,440
so they're like reasons why these

24
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,210
companies are doing this I think it's

25
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,010
not that interesting to discuss that in

26
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,650
detail here but the more or less it's

27
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,780
for them it's open open they're using

28
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,870
open-source to reach business goals and

29
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:23,350
so going to the IOT stuff just to

30
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,930
understand why Barcia is so interested

31
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,970
in these stuff it's we have for example

32
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,240
this device and it's on many

33
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,280
construction set so they're looking for

34
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,310
something a way so they can like the

35
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,410
people buying that they're looking for a

36
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:41,229
way to make sure that they know where

37
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:43,600
their devices are and for example also

38
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,340
to know when they are getting lost and

39
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,560
so that's one application it's called

40
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,470
like track my tool and it's actually

41
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,300
just tracking these devices on the

42
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,399
different construction sets another

43
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,740
thing is this thing it's just a little

44
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,170
thing in four parking spaces where it

45
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,119
detects is there if there is a car

46
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,560
actually on top of it

47
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,789
very simple the problem is actually that

48
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:07,899
browsers produces something like 1

49
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:11,560
million devices per day so you can

50
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,360
imagine what that means if you will if

51
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,480
you build like for every single use case

52
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,810
the only software stack

53
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,050
another thing is so that's only like

54
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,970
individual devices but now we are coming

55
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:28,819
to bigger things that are aggregated

56
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:31,130
from many different devices for example

57
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,380
in a car there like tons of different

58
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,750
devices in there and they become the

59
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,430
future is that they will become

60
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,530
connected so you also have to aggregate

61
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,150
all these things and you have to get

62
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,480
these things working as well so now

63
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,640
coming to the real stuff that's the

64
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,310
motivation behind it we need something

65
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,660
that is putting all these things

66
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,290
together

67
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,150
and it's you have like three different

68
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,800
stacks that are really interesting

69
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,350
constraint devices gateways and I the IT

70
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:04,010
cloud platform so today I will focus on

71
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,860
the IOT cloud platform that's the part

72
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,830
that is really the interesting thing

73
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,239
because there everything is coming

74
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:13,100
together so the current situation is

75
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,190
that typically you have isolated

76
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,739
solutions for every device class for and

77
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:21,530
every vendor you have one stack of

78
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:24,050
course there are like generic components

79
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,420
in there but still it is one stack for

80
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:31,220
one use case actually what many many

81
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,380
people want is something like that they

82
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,090
want to have a generic IOT platform in

83
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,660
the middle so you have IOT solutions on

84
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,820
top and also the interesting thing is

85
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,340
you have it cross domain so you can

86
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,900
connect devices from different domains

87
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,150
together in the same platform so you can

88
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,000
build solutions that are like spreading

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,459
over these two my intent of course it

90
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:53,989
should be cross vendor because typically

91
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:55,730
you don't want to have only devices from

92
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,560
one vendor for example in your house or

93
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,320
like India enter our life so it needs to

94
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,209
be cross vendor cross domain how to

95
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:04,820
achieve that is really hard so and

96
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,769
everyone wants to go and you want to get

97
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:09,590
into this generic IOT platform so

98
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,239
everyone wants to provide this generic

99
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:13,910
IOT platform and so it's a huge like

100
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,548
yeah well it's a competition going on

101
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,918
who is providing this generic IOT

102
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:22,220
platform so everyone like that is

103
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,200
somehow connected to that is trying to

104
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,919
make this race and so the decision for

105
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,950
us was I think the best idea is to do it

106
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,440
do it like true large extent as open

107
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,370
source

108
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,889
and so the idea is not going this way I

109
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:38,530
have a close third party IOT platform

110
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,139
not like buying it from someone or just

111
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:45,350
going on top of that but building it not

112
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,910
by ourselves because then we would just

113
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,910
have the same problem but instead having

114
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:54,199
an open IOT platform so that's the basic

115
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:54,710
idea

116
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,870
have an open IOT platform so how can you

117
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,760
actually do this so we were looking

118
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,250
around and we were like looking for the

119
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,800
best thing the best fit so what is the

120
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,169
the best approach to that and what we

121
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:08,090
found was the Eclipse IOT working group

122
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:11,270
so we got really engaged into that and

123
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,520
we started like doing that for like two

124
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,320
years ago or something when we got

125
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,900
really serious about it and so one of

126
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,110
the this element so I said that there

127
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:25,370
will be one one demo one of this is

128
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,789
Harpeth so Eclipse harp it is one

129
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:29,900
open-source project

130
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,810
what's the functionality for it so just

131
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,340
imagine you have like thousands and

132
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,810
million of the devices that are out

133
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,580
there and you need to update the

134
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,380
software on it maybe just a part of it

135
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,590
maybe you want to like add just one

136
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,450
component into that or you wouldn't want

137
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,880
to update the entire device whatever it

138
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,970
is you need to roll it out and that's

139
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:52,580
sometimes really hard and typically what

140
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,960
you want to do you want to have first

141
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,849
you need to make sure that you have

142
00:05:55,849 --> 00:05:58,550
every device in your list you want to

143
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,740
make sure that every device in there is

144
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,660
in the same state or you know exactly in

145
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,310
which state it is you want to control

146
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,900
these things and you also want to see

147
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,310
for example if it works first you would

148
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,139
do like a test rollout for like some

149
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,450
devices and all that stuff so that's the

150
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:18,490
idea behind eclipse hop it

151
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:22,180
so I just have a little video I even

152
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,160
will not say much about it it's a it's

153
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,560
around 4 minutes then you will see how

154
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,919
actually you can what you can do it and

155
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,620
it's more or less just compiling Hawk

156
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,660
with the source code deploying it into

157
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,160
bluemix so it's not like our platform so

158
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,870
that shows it's not like somehow

159
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,900
depending to to Bosch or something it's

160
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,460
setting up the environment at devices

161
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,069
create tax uplift artifacts set up an

162
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:49,949
upgraded campaign for a given filter set

163
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:52,360
and execute the campaign and show that

164
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,070
hopefully provides live reports as well

165
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,690
as detailed logs for post-mortem

166
00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:00,840
analysis so I will show that

167
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,910
I hope I can get in on the right screen

168
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,460
no no this thing is gone

169
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:23,660
given the idea yeah the boxes being

170
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:33,890
let's fly positive ox this works

171
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,530
great

172
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:41,320
[Music]

173
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,420
No okay we don't know over the onions

174
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,540
it's also in YouTube so just to show

175
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,880
that actually there's some real cold and

176
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,350
you can actually run it it's not just

177
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,990
like some PowerPoint slides or anything

178
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:55,710
like that

179
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,890
and it's accessible to everyone of

180
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,750
course what you need is you need like

181
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,250
something you need access to something

182
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,190
like bluemix or like another cloud

183
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,040
foundry instance for example because

184
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,550
it's also Benjamin so Benjamin Kabir has

185
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:15,180
actually compiled that so it's that's

186
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,550
again showing it you don't actually be

187
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,770
part of Bart or anything like that to

188
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,380
get all to do all this stuff he also got

189
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,850
it running on on General Electric's

190
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,900
products that's so it's it's not

191
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,500
depending that much on single yeah

192
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,450
providers for for Cloud Foundry

193
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:42,610
so I will for these people that do not

194
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,310
want to look at the at this stuff I just

195
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:48,400
will tell a little bit more about the

196
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,360
the entire setting so it's there's other

197
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,060
companies working on all these things so

198
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,330
for example another another platform

199
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,450
that is supported is open shift from Red

200
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,120
Hat so a rattle is included in there in

201
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,710
the Eclipse RIT working group it's many

202
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,870
many companies but there are some that

203
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,210
are more active and at the moment it's

204
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,860
for example right that is really active

205
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:16,870
and your attack and so we have many

206
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,420
different parts of the puzzle that are

207
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,960
actually going towards towards this

208
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,310
cloud platform but it's so at the moment

209
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:32,339
this is like one piece of the puzzle and

210
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:36,439
yeahjust i don't want to distract too

211
00:09:36,439 --> 00:09:38,689
much so at least you can the ones that

212
00:09:38,689 --> 00:09:41,929
want to see it can have a rough

213
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:44,799
imagination of it

214
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:55,149
yeah so it's

215
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,110
the idea is that you have this generic

216
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,459
IOT layer on top of like a of a cloud

217
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:08,180
layer so that you can then connect any

218
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,060
device to it that is supporting it of

219
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,640
course it needs to be somehow attached

220
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,279
to this cloud platform that will be next

221
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:19,970
component that I will present it's there

222
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,490
it's it's about it's called hanno and

223
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,279
it's it's an another piece of the puzzle

224
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,140
so more and more pieces are coming

225
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,390
together so that at the end of the of

226
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,839
the day you will actually have an entire

227
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:35,839
platform ready there in the Eclipse IDE

228
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,779
working group so that can be then used

229
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:41,930
by everyone just to connect devices in a

230
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,739
very generic way

231
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,710
sorry feet falling asleep

232
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,910
so that's actually the the way you just

233
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:10,310
deploy that stuff to the tour to the

234
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:14,630
corresponding devices and you can then

235
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,580
also follow up the the state of it

236
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,779
so that was like a really quick way how

237
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:23,360
to get the something like cockpit up and

238
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,730
running and as I said that's just one of

239
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,450
the components

240
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,380
should I reconnect this was trying to be

241
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:42,430
better that one should good let's record

242
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,720
sir slice as well

243
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,550
can we decided was working

244
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,600
yes

245
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:55,529
okay

246
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,460
I just don't see it here

247
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:13,410
okay so as I said another thing what you

248
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,509
need is you need to connect all these

249
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:16,949
different devices with all the different

250
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:19,740
protocols somehow to this cloud platform

251
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,190
and that is exactly the idea how can you

252
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,959
actually do that how many different

253
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,329
technologies do you need to get all

254
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,069
these different devices with all these

255
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:32,220
different protocols connected and the

256
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,589
answer is it's a little bit like an yeah

257
00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:37,290
joke just one of course it's not of

258
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,370
course you need a lot of things in the

259
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,139
background but the idea is that you have

260
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:42,060
one component that is the central

261
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,100
component to handle all these things and

262
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,380
that is Honam it's it has like one thing

263
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,720
that is doing the the brokering of all

264
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,730
the messaging and everything like that

265
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,829
and then you have a lot of different

266
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:57,540
protocol adapters that handle all these

267
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,000
different protocols but there is a

268
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,690
general challenge with all these IOT

269
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:06,480
devices especially when it goings into

270
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,850
thousands and millions and more and more

271
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,430
devices because then you have that you a

272
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,850
lot of data telemetry data that is going

273
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,860
one direction you have a little bit

274
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,139
command and control that data that is

275
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:21,750
going both directions and the problem is

276
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,850
that typically command and control it

277
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,769
they should not get lost while the

278
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:28,079
telemetry data okay it's fine when like

279
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,910
one or two temperature informations is

280
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,980
not going through but for example then

281
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,389
you also have some some messages that

282
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:38,389
really should go through for example an

283
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:40,709
emergency call from a car that just

284
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:43,529
crashed so handling all these different

285
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:46,019
things is actually a real challenge and

286
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:47,970
that is what how no try is trying to

287
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,519
make sure that it works and also that

288
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:53,639
giving all the software behind that a

289
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,880
common interface so they can they do not

290
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,399
have to deal with all the single

291
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,209
implementations of all the different

292
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:02,660
protocols

293
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,120
so the goal is actually to have a ready

294
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,399
to deploy Microsoft based IOT cloud

295
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:10,370
platform and to have one technology that

296
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,769
everyone is agreeing on and that we can

297
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,839
have actually something that works for

298
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,240
everyone and that is of course a really

299
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,459
hard goal but at the end of the day that

300
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:21,980
is what is needed by the market or by by

301
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,110
the people and so we are trying to get

302
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,019
there as good as possible and we hope

303
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:30,230
that this is working out so the basic

304
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,939
idea is exactly so the different use

305
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:34,550
cases that we that I just described to

306
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,129
map that and get these different

307
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:38,660
components that are currently already

308
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,740
there together in one set up so that you

309
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,629
have this open source IOT cloud platform

310
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:49,250
so there these are just like other

311
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,410
different projects there's in the mqtt

312
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,279
project not not mqtt but here it's using

313
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,560
community as a protocol adapter but

314
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,139
there's also to project mosquito and

315
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:03,949
Tahoe that is dealing with that is

316
00:15:03,949 --> 00:15:07,339
dealing with mqtt and they can be used

317
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:10,180
in here then there's leash on as a

318
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,069
lightweight m2m protocol adapter and

319
00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:16,069
there's also for example rest and http2

320
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:20,000
so you can for example do debugging and

321
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,480
on the server part you have things like

322
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,850
hop bit or then for example you have the

323
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,339
applications track my tool or the

324
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:30,589
parking lot management and so you can

325
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:33,019
you have one interface that is handling

326
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:35,720
all the data communication with the

327
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,199
devices

328
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,240
so another thing is I just want to show

329
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,040
you that there like a lot of different

330
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,320
areas that need to be somehow addressed

331
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,560
so another area that is a big problem is

332
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,740
the the actually the abstraction layer

333
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,110
for the devices you need one way to

334
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,880
describe the devices so all the

335
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,550
different tools can somehow deal with

336
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:03,600
them and the idea was okay there are so

337
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,700
many different standards and protocols

338
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,650
of course they are coming out of

339
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,420
different domains so we need one way

340
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,730
that we can somehow abstract that away

341
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:15,300
or translate it and the idea behind that

342
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,680
is Eclipse morto

343
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,190
so you can have you have imported and

344
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,320
you have a quotas so what in you can

345
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,790
look at it as a tool that is translating

346
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,500
device descriptions from one thing to

347
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,920
another one

348
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,480
so that is a rough picture of mayor of

349
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,499
like some of the projects so in this

350
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,449
picture that I've did have said that

351
00:16:42,449 --> 00:16:43,499
I've just kiddin

352
00:16:43,499 --> 00:16:46,589
he we covered portal hanno

353
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,680
and also Hawk pit but there's also

354
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,620
californium which is a part which is a

355
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,079
co-op stack and we also have leash on

356
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:57,720
that is a life with MGM was we've said I

357
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,050
said something about mosquito and Tahoe

358
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:05,010
that's the mqtt stuff there's also

359
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,500
another interesting project that has

360
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,549
just been started eclipse Kapua and they

361
00:17:11,549 --> 00:17:13,859
sit has been started by your tech they

362
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:17,449
in a way they open source their entire

363
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:21,539
back-end for the IOT stuff and now that

364
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:24,449
we are working on onto integrating all

365
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:26,760
these things together somehow that we

366
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,549
can actually have one platform it's

367
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,860
still on the way but let's see where

368
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,280
it's going

369
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:39,250
so these are the I think this is quite

370
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,409
up to date this is the current members

371
00:17:41,409 --> 00:17:44,200
of the Eclipse IOT working group it's

372
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,130
it's it's really a lot of love

373
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,889
interesting projects going on and it's

374
00:17:50,889 --> 00:17:52,600
it's it's really good to do that

375
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,919
together with all these different

376
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,480
companies and also individuals

377
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:02,040
it's it's also another thing to get that

378
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,760
forward and getting into other

379
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,440
situations for example there's the

380
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,000
Absecon project they will start in May

381
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,160
it's about connecting cars with each

382
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,250
other or not not only with each other

383
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,170
but with a cloud platform so it's one

384
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:19,290
use case for one domain and this is will

385
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:23,309
be also open source it's it's a publicly

386
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:25,980
funded project and for example the

387
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,480
Eclipse Foundation is participating

388
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,750
there as well so just we now we just

389
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,300
probably talked about the layer the

390
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,870
Eclipse IT layer so that's the IT

391
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,330
specific IOT specific layer but this

392
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,850
needs to run on some kind of cloud layer

393
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:45,960
so we have chosen to to use Cloud

394
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,179
Foundry at the moment but there as a set

395
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:50,040
redhead for example is putting it on

396
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,880
OpenShift

397
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,220
and other companies are putting it on

398
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,160
other stuff so there are many different

399
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,809
cloud technologies at the moment that

400
00:18:57,809 --> 00:18:59,280
would work I just wanted to give an

401
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,500
overview about Cloud Foundry just like

402
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,900
some numbers how many companies and

403
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,040
proaches they are involved and it's it's

404
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,790
also it's also open source so it's this

405
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,070
way you have a complete open source

406
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,429
stack you just need below that the

407
00:19:17,429 --> 00:19:20,120
infrastructure as a service tech

408
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,750
so the the crucial point is that

409
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,289
actually no one can do this IT stuff or

410
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:30,980
IOT stuff alone you need a lot of people

411
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,260
that joining together because and of

412
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,270
course also this platform the crucial

413
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,919
thing is that it will be adopted that

414
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:38,870
people are working on it that people are

415
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,570
coming together and make this work if

416
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,890
someone thinks this is not the right

417
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,690
platform and some something else is much

418
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,580
better that's also really interesting

419
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,529
for us and I think also for everyone in

420
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:51,529
the Eclipse IDE working group because if

421
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:54,830
it's at least if it is open-source it

422
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,690
might be a good idea then to join forces

423
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,850
and just could collaborate somehow

424
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:04,149
so that's roughly what we've done in in

425
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:07,870
the recent past to like that's our ramp

426
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:13,529
up so we started roughly in 2014 and we

427
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:16,720
got like and we started more projects we

428
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,850
even became strategic member of the

429
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,730
Eclipse Foundation so for a company like

430
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,649
Bosch it's really new to get into all

431
00:20:23,649 --> 00:20:25,630
these things and it's getting more and

432
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,289
more forward so that's a good idea and

433
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:30,519
it's really great what is happening

434
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:33,610
inside the Eclipse IT community there's

435
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,830
there are already 2.2 million lines of

436
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:40,990
code 26 projects and it's getting more

437
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:44,320
and more - more more than 210 developers

438
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:50,110
and 110,000 monthly visitors and all the

439
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:55,269
numbers are moving forward so if you are

440
00:20:55,269 --> 00:20:57,460
interested that would be really great it

441
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,139
would be really great that more and more

442
00:20:59,139 --> 00:21:00,879
people are coming in so we can build

443
00:21:00,879 --> 00:21:02,769
this open-source IOT platform together

444
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:06,519
and one other one opportunity to do that

445
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:10,090
is we have a hackathon at the Bosch it's

446
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,649
called the Bosch connected experience

447
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:14,950
where we also are trying to do a little

448
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,679
bit more off getting into the coding

449
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,970
stuff and that's for student startups

450
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,799
and things like that it's for free and

451
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:28,750
for corporate visitors it's typically it

452
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,330
costs a little fee for them most of the

453
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,909
time it's not a problem but I also could

454
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:37,750
provide some for corporate visitors I

455
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,519
can provide some free tickets so if

456
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:40,899
you're interested one way or the other

457
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:44,740
just go on the website or you could just

458
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,289
contact me it would be really great and

459
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:50,399
yeah so in general it would be

460
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:52,539
absolutely great if you can give

461
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:54,850
feedback if you can just join or help or

462
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:57,220
discuss or it contribute to start other

463
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,350
projects integrated somewhere tested

464
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:02,019
poured it so it just big it's getting

465
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:03,850
more and more better and better and so

466
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:07,149
we can have one one day like a great

467
00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:10,659
open source IOT platform on these three

468
00:22:10,659 --> 00:22:14,010
stacks so that's that's the goal and

469
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,050
it would be great if we'd work if it

470
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:18,810
were to go to work out so thank you for

471
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:21,630
your attention and if you have any

472
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:25,970
questions just let me know

473
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,950
for example Siemens was was on there as

474
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,520
well the question sorry the question was

475
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,780
what are the competitors doing for

476
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:40,200
example Zeman's so Siemens is also

477
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,280
participating here

478
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,260
somehow they are also in the eclipse iit

479
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:47,190
working group so in Dave for example for

480
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,320
Eclipse hot bit they've been working on

481
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,610
the part that is on the device so it's

482
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:56,040
and they so their collaborations with

483
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,600
many competitors of course they are also

484
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,720
other open-source approaches so it's

485
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,250
it's still we're still in the point

486
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,290
where is trying to figure out what's the

487
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:21,540
future yes respect to our mission for

488
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:24,669
money because of the other way around

489
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:28,269
physical stuff and you move up and yeah

490
00:23:28,269 --> 00:23:32,309
the other guy that was from the software

491
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:35,859
because you also have the product and

492
00:23:35,859 --> 00:23:39,100
like Siemens and other big companies you

493
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,559
see a difference of different approach

494
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:45,509
another vantage from your site or

495
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:48,759
so the question was if there are the

496
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:50,019
hardware vendors in there the software

497
00:23:50,019 --> 00:23:51,909
vendors or like companies that are

498
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:53,950
hardware based and software based and so

499
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,080
if there if there is a different

500
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,599
approach between the two and I can

501
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:02,200
definitely say yes so for example it's

502
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,570
totally the development methods and the

503
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,070
the speed and all these things are very

504
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,529
different so but it's becoming obvious

505
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:11,259
that both have to adjust because with

506
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:13,899
the Internet of Things these two

507
00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:16,840
different domains are coming together so

508
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,909
we can see differences and it's one of

509
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:41,169
the challenge I think collaboration is

510
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:43,629
the key so these two domains have to

511
00:24:43,629 --> 00:24:44,979
collaborate together now I think exactly

512
00:24:44,979 --> 00:24:46,599
open-source is the right way to do that

513
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:50,499
so I think my time is up thanks for

514
00:24:50,499 --> 00:24:56,409
everyone if you have more questions if

515
00:24:56,409 --> 00:24:57,970
you have more questions please don't

516
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:00,960
hesitate to contact me
