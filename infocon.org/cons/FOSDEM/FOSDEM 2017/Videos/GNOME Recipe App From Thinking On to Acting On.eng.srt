1
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,550
hi thanks for coming and staying as

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,570
everyone in this will know about genome

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,330
so what not for the ones who don't know

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,990
genome is a free desktop freeze Linux

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,970
desktop and Callum is all about -

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,130
community we have people all around

7
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,050
throat and we are building applications

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,220
together and I wanted to we were talk

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,488
about one of the applications we are

10
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:34,739
working on first think I'm going to be

11
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,360
talking about right it idea come from

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,030
for the recipe app second thing I'm

13
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,530
gonna be talking about the design

14
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,350
process and then what else is here and

15
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,720
his mouth the main developers of the

16
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,550
application and he will give a live demo

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,060
of the application to you actually this

18
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,730
is not a new idea people in the genome

19
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,300
has always been interested in in cooking

20
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,610
and we have a wiki page for the genome

21
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,049
cookbook that base back to 2007 and

22
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:08,880
people even contribute recipes there but

23
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,500
for one reason or another we just

24
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,580
couldn't make that thing happen and this

25
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,680
is quite important for genome because we

26
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,400
will be celebrating our 20th year and we

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,450
just wanted to make this application

28
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,700
happen so we can give it to be analyzed

29
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:31,320
again as a birthday present and when you

30
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,630
do design work it's quite simple you

31
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,159
should be following some kind of

32
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,830
structured design process and for us the

33
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,479
most important thing is to define your

34
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,260
goals defining your goals is quite

35
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,600
important because you don't you just it

36
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,780
enables you to focus on your design and

37
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,140
third recipe those posts were finding

38
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,490
recipes all over the world and again is

39
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,200
a big community and there might be some

40
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,590
people that has food allergies all and

41
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,580
we want to support those people by every

42
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,610
time describing the food food

43
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,610
restrictions and we just wanted to share

44
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,529
that book we just want to share the

45
00:02:13,529 --> 00:02:17,230
recipes sharing recipes and

46
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,110
fine and print off recipes so we can put

47
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:25,190
them on your fridge and think about your

48
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,930
goals help you defining your focus and

49
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,970
that mostly involves what you are not

50
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,710
going to built as much as what you are

51
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,500
going to build so it's very useful to

52
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,280
have the mongols while you are focusing

53
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,470
on your design and constraints are also

54
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,990
important it seems like the technology

55
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,120
you are using all the resources you have

56
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,550
because based on your resources you want

57
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,170
to drop some of the features you are

58
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:51,380
planning planning to develop in the

59
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,860
second stage in the design process is

60
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,070
exploration

61
00:02:55,070 --> 00:03:00,320
it is research-based thing and missing

62
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,810
less user research and looking at the

63
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,520
relevant art and for the genome

64
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,500
recipient we look for the boom

65
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,660
application X again I'm Troy application

66
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,810
and this cooking application K recipes

67
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,220
and BDC fruit website and while you are

68
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,800
looking at existing applications you

69
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,959
should be able to 18-ton like what you

70
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:25,520
like about them and what you don't like

71
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:35,200
about them and three edit istic and

72
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,810
changes in the design processes to

73
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:45,670
develop your design and here you can use

74
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,239
or you might use Inkscape or sketch

75
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:56,900
tools like that and here you just have

76
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,090
like lots of things in your hand lots of

77
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:03,290
design ideas concept ideas and by going

78
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,880
through the process you just narrowed

79
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:10,790
them down and and at this stage you can

80
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,700
start to do your mock-ups and but the

81
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,130
thing you should be careful that you

82
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,950
shouldn't be like detailing everything

83
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:22,400
every little things you have you don't

84
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,050
want to tell everybody that your app is

85
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,789
gonna do it should be a high level thing

86
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,820
it is just a three step process

87
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,220
definition you just you're just go

88
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,229
you're just defining what you are going

89
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:39,210
to build exploration you just explore

90
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,789
your problem space and landing in the

91
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:44,669
development stage you just designed

92
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:46,560
something but this is not a linear

93
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,570
process you are just going to do back

94
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,900
and forward in this process and while

95
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,789
you are doing this you just rerun your

96
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:59,729
goals here and once you want to design

97
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:02,639
an application for a platform you need a

98
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,340
design language for that and forgetting

99
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,990
it's sick this is our replication icon

100
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,440
and our visual designer Jakub wanted to

101
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,009
do this for us and those are the first

102
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:20,820
sketches he'll done in the beginning but

103
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,880
I tend we have this logo and we had the

104
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,860
secrecy or you might want to get them at

105
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,099
the end of the presentation and I will

106
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:30,960
just walk you through the screens we

107
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,060
have I just wanted to put my mock-ups

108
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,800
and the actual design we have right now

109
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,880
so you can see that how this evolved my

110
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,210
time and this thing is quite similar to

111
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,669
what we have for the genome software

112
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:47,630
application you we just want to keep

113
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:51,139
things similar in the is in the genome

114
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:55,639
and this is for the cook later feature

115
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:59,580
you just runs on the recipe detail page

116
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,340
once you press the button for the cookie

117
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,539
later you just you the ingredients on

118
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:09,330
the recipes are added to your shopping

119
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,020
list and you may print them and you may

120
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:17,430
go with them to the market and could you

121
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,310
taste it was one of the goals while you

122
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,150
are working on it because you know

123
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,740
comics I think and we have people all

124
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,419
around words and we want to categorize

125
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:31,440
those countries with countries we just

126
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,969
want to categorize those things and for

127
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:38,740
the chef's page

128
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,830
so people can explain them here can

129
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,870
explain themselves here

130
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,850
this is just for adding a new recipe

131
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:50,690
page and we may be restrictions food

132
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,510
restrictions with dietary restrictions

133
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:58,310
and the spiciness level as well and on

134
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,930
your SP detail page we have start

135
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,730
cooking button once you start to cook

136
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,120
start cooking button a full wheel

137
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,810
appears on your screen and by the by the

138
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,030
full view you can just follow your

139
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,670
process step by step because you might

140
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:17,840
have like messy lands and you might you

141
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,000
can just your one hand like going

142
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,960
through the screens here and this is the

143
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,030
UI revealed this is done in Bruno last

144
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,180
week with Mattias Tomas and Yaqoob and

145
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,150
they came the idea that it is quite

146
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,910
difficult to add any recipe on our

147
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,370
screen and editing as well so we are

148
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,880
planning to simplify this process and it

149
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,920
will be done my time so if you want to

150
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,080
see the details for the recipe up you

151
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,300
can go for the project page and those

152
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,390
are the people that contribute to SPF

153
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,600
and I want to thank them all I'll try

154
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,960
them all

155
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:07,429
[Applause]

156
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:21,260
can you hear me okay let's see I also

157
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:33,110
see something might like so this is a

158
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,490
live demo that's almost a fun part and

159
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,679
something good for you but I hope you

160
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:41,620
all enjoy that I always enjoy it so

161
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,960
[Music]

162
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:58,280
what much direction it's the hot part of

163
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,680
it

164
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,960
so I'm not yes hi everybody I spend most

165
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,600
of the coding on this application and

166
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,070
it's going to do a bit of a live demo

167
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,350
here let's see if this actually works if

168
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:16,100
I confront my application so does Evan

169
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,160
said she told the paper mock-ups that I

170
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,040
started working for him initially and

171
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,770
that was back in October and it was the

172
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,870
first step I try to implement just that

173
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,480
lesson those mock-ups pretty much as

174
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,610
accurately as I could and this is how

175
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,080
the application looked I guess

176
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,030
mid-november so after like three or four

177
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,700
weeks of working on it and I'll just let

178
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,490
click to a few things here too to show

179
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,650
some things they've got a lot of

180
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,270
functionality they already let me have

181
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:48,290
this recipes landing page in place you

182
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,210
have two cuisines page we actually

183
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,440
didn't have an ingredients page that

184
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,820
it's no longer there I'll talk about

185
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,580
that in a minute when I first I can type

186
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,250
into this year this is the which no

187
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,530
details details page for an individual

188
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:04,070
recipe and just arrange things on the

189
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,580
screen somehow here and functionality is

190
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,290
actually in place here quite a bit

191
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,540
there's like an image switcher here so

192
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,740
you can have multiple images for each

193
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,530
recipe and you can actually something

194
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:18,080
I'm a little proud of you can say I want

195
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,880
to serve six people instead of four and

196
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,010
then the ingredients list actually gets

197
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,550
scaled up so that's neat

198
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:27,470
and then there's this stop cooking

199
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,410
button that Evan talked about but this

200
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,390
that's the initial idea just a quick fix

201
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,010
sketch for Africa - for supporting

202
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,420
people when they actually went to cook

203
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,220
those recipes and we came up with this

204
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,720
idea of having a checklist where you can

205
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,600
say okay I've got them ingredients

206
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,830
northfield at the oven and I followed

207
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,210
all the instructions and now I can set a

208
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:48,860
timer and then I'll be done so let us

209
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:53,030
take a very quick idea for supporting

210
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:57,320
cooking and yeah I mean relatively

211
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:03,710
quickly oh okay let's see what else

212
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:07,670
and you know it switched or the

213
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:17,210
application as it looks today and I

214
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,040
think it looks clearly more where you

215
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,560
find so after implementing the original

216
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,899
mock-ups we went over basically every

217
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:25,459
part of the application with Jacob and

218
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:27,860
Evelyn and we visited the initial design

219
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,320
and came up with some nice a visuals for

220
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,080
the tiles and ranch everything neatly in

221
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,700
three columns and all these things that

222
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:39,589
make it look good and you can even set

223
00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:41,450
this is a the landing page looks kind of

224
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,160
similar it looks and feels similar to

225
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,630
the landing page of our grant

226
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,250
applications like this is the grant 3

227
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,410
application style of it so you can just

228
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,620
start the type and search will happen

229
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,000
like this so it is the search results

230
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,660
and I wanted to find this recipe because

231
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:02,990
this is when I can actually so that you

232
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,089
can see it looks a little more organized

233
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:09,709
now than the prospect them and then it's

234
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:12,890
grabbing future still they do that it

235
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:15,950
works again awesome and they left us

236
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,470
images here we actually have like a full

237
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,750
screen laptop so the image is now so you

238
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,670
can actually see in detail and you can

239
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,670
go through them and expect the

240
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:29,510
functionality I guess what else here

241
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,250
there's the ingredients list you can see

242
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,209
that you can actually split the

243
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,220
ingredients list in separate sections

244
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,570
that there's a segment for the dough and

245
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,709
then you can have a different

246
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:40,480
ingredients list for the toppings and

247
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,279
the shopping list feature a feature that

248
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,779
Evan mentioned is now called buy

249
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:46,910
ingredients just because it's Morpheus

250
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,490
that that's what it does but I'm not

251
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,600
gonna check that now I'm going to click

252
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,959
on edit so this is the the edit view for

253
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:57,050
this recipe now and I just want to very

254
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:00,459
quickly show that I can actually change

255
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:03,820
this here maybe I want to say oops

256
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,570
skinny I discovered off-screen that's

257
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,910
gonna have bad see if I can bring this

258
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,969
down

259
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:17,080
actual americanus fitted and then so

260
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:22,480
that works editing works and if I scroll

261
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,360
down here this big text field at the

262
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,470
bottom years that you enter like the

263
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,880
main part of the recipe the instructions

264
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,130
that what they are going to do and

265
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,930
originally they just have a plain text

266
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:33,190
feed for that and people were writing

267
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,770
the text there and everybody's kind of

268
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,390
itching to like do some formatting there

269
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,800
so you want to make it a sequence of

270
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,380
steps and maybe actually put some images

271
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,510
there and help to use it that way and we

272
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,870
try to support this now a little bit by

273
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,190
actually defining your kind of icky like

274
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,770
minnie sonntag cieared and it's

275
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,960
explained here and they decided to not

276
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,280
hire to send the user that actually just

277
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,750
put it in the texture so you can

278
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,010
actually see the markup so people can

279
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,450
learn how to enter that menu at the

280
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,580
world but we do have buttons to support

281
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,190
that and it's a little bit maybe an

282
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,420
inspiration from the top you have this

283
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,340
every period but you can also search to

284
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,380
preview and then you see how it's going

285
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,810
to look in the actual cooking mode and

286
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:14,170
you can step through this here so

287
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,640
there's the sequence of steps if you

288
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,270
entered and there's a timer here so you

289
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,460
can actually add timers to this and if I

290
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,480
click the stop button it'll actually

291
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,300
start ticking down slowly so that's all

292
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,580
functional and oops now I forgot the

293
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,890
picture here in this in this step so I

294
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,060
can go back to the Edit view and

295
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,050
actually at that picture say view at

296
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,990
this one and if I now go back to to

297
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,620
preview it should be hopefully yes so

298
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:49,150
that works too and I think that is just

299
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,160
one more thing I'll go back to the to

300
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,410
the old view the old application from

301
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,390
back in November and then I mentioned is

302
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,850
that you have up here we have this

303
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,310
ingredients view which wasn't me I which

304
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,320
no paper mock-ups that I received so I

305
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,970
had quite a bit of fun actually

306
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,089
implementing these there's like this low

307
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:07,900
alphabetical sat down here and you can

308
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,490
clear a little like nice to animate and

309
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:10,900
things like that so I spent like a

310
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,110
weekend on that but you couldn't really

311
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,910
figure out how to make this useful for

312
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,410
the overall goal of the application so

313
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,630
we also are operating on their deadlines

314
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,950
here because we want to like have this

315
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,480
basically ready for

316
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,850
nomes 20th birthday so it needs to be in

317
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:27,190
nan 324 which is going to be released in

318
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,320
mid-march only a few weeks left so we

319
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,820
decided to practice from the application

320
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,889
it's no longer me it's no longer in the

321
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:37,170
constancy it even need to go back to the

322
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,449
menu so no longer there sometimes you

323
00:15:40,449 --> 00:15:41,649
have to cut a feature to like make the

324
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,220
deadline but I can that's basically what

325
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,460
I want to show here

326
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:53,140
[Applause]

327
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,210
[Music]

328
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,870
right so um yes I'm one of the main gtk

329
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,470
maintain us

330
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,150
so obviously I'm using to declare not

331
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,680
very familiar with it so I don't

332
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,480
necessarily need an idea to and I get

333
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,220
something like this put together that

334
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,750
part of my motivation for working on

335
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,970
this rest or sorry I'll repeat the

336
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:29,990
question so the question must spread the

337
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,060
tools that are used to developers did I

338
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,950
use an IDE for this or did I just like

339
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:37,070
use VI time I just use your eye because

340
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,810
that's what I've grown up with and um

341
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,720
but I'm familiar with but I'm part of my

342
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,310
motivation for working this was testing

343
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,110
a lot of few things that we develop into

344
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,830
norm like sandboxing the flat-pack and

345
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:51,860
non-billable and ng t k3 new bicha tree

346
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,540
and things like that so I did actually

347
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,980
make conscious effort to try and use

348
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,440
command builder for doing some of these

349
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,750
things but it's really hard to teach an

350
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,730
old horse new tricks and I often just

351
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,760
fall back to use rely on the terminal

352
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,190
just I can't help myself

353
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:09,299
[Music]

354
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:13,430
see and like UI files like XML templates

355
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,470
so the UI is not neatly separated from

356
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,880
the functionality but it's it's written

357
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:29,600
in C because we wanted to keep it kind

358
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,010
of many more you're talking about the

359
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,320
like the image and time I think that I

360
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,570
shot there yeah we didn't really discuss

361
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:38,570
that much we could only at some point be

362
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,130
poured upon things like headlines

363
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,540
headings and more markup for sections

364
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,940
yeah yeah you're coming from and we will

365
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,210
consider

366
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:59,060
I live in stuff I live in Istanbul and

367
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,550
he lives in Boston so we are just

368
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:05,860
communicating online for this project I

369
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:17,570
think like every few days every few days

370
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,870
we just talk online yeah okay Graham we

371
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:25,970
are using here just a show like

372
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:29,060
functionality I'm developing this on

373
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,220
Linux and I have mic there's a mic here

374
00:18:31,220 --> 00:19:08,690
and I did actually make it it could

375
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,430
certainly be I mean I've been working on

376
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,560
this as a weekend side project so I

377
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,960
don't necessary have infinite resources

378
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,310
to sink into this but if somebody were

379
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,080
to give me a pet for that I would be

380
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,650
really happy

381
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:21,110
currently we're just importing and

382
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:24,050
exporting a very stupid homegrown format

383
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,910
just because I needed to have import

384
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,250
functionality early on because we are

385
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,810
asking the community to contribute their

386
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,490
recipe so we kind of need to have a way

387
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,290
for them to like get them to us so they

388
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,090
need to put them in the application and

389
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,380
they export them and they send them

390
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,690
which other way to us so that was an

391
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,550
early priority to have that in place but

392
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,470
having an importer for like more

393
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,540
established recipe Fonuts hope you arson

394
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,590
if somebody wrote

395
00:19:56,509 --> 00:19:59,370
no doubt they'll start locally elected I

396
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,110
have some kind of stupid key far from it

397
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:12,330
yeah yes I will make sure what the

398
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,460
application will be able to load the old

399
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,730
recipes I think and if not you can blame

400
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:38,999
me for that yes we have a kind of this

401
00:20:38,999 --> 00:20:41,879
idea in the genome as a genome cookbook

402
00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:44,730
and it they expect to 2007 and we have a

403
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:47,039
we have an upcoming birthday for the

404
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,340
genome and we wanted to get on this as a

405
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,210
birthday present

406
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,019
it's the

407
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:21,650
we also have one designer in Czech

408
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:25,340
Republic and it was like for example

409
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,170
three of us were not available at the

410
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:30,470
same time so sometimes Mattias was

411
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,930
talking to me I was talking to him and

412
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,910
then he was talking to your coop and it

413
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,230
was like kind of a difficult

414
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,420
communication but we just made it happen

415
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:41,480
at the end yeah because I really have

416
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,530
liked working like crazy so I just

417
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:48,470
couldn't have that much time to help to

418
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:53,570
set up a call at the same time like one

419
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:54,320
or two hangouts

420
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,900
together to just swing up and see where

421
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,270
things stand and the starting point for

422
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,890
this application was actually at quark I

423
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,290
believe you sat down with Jacob to like

424
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:06,620
talk to your mock-ups so there was some

425
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,840
initial face-to-face meeting at least

426
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,290
and some soon at various points via

427
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:18,680
hangout yeah all right no further

428
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,990
questions I guess done everybody's

429
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:23,030
welcome to come up here and like grab a

430
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,050
stick as long as they last

431
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,490
I would ask everybody who takes a

432
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:27,290
sticker to maybe try the application and

433
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:29,120
if you submit a recipe that would be

434
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,000
really awesome

435
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,920
[Applause]
