1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,629
okay we're gonna get started here in

2
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:13,460
just a moment we're doing our best to

3
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:22,800
get professor Doug Lee on skype one

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,970
could probably question our choice of

5
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,410
methods of getting him here but in any

6
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,660
event we're gonna see if that works

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,910
other than that I'm actually pleased to

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,570
say that I think this is the most

9
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,560
complete representation actually being

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,850
physically here in the room that we've

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,090
we've had in one of these sessions in

12
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,420
meatspace as Andersons and and so we'll

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,880
just start out and quickly to make sure

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,340
everyone is in the right place this

15
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,079
session is the openjdk governing board

16
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,440
QA and so of course that means what

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,090
we're going to do is is let you guys ask

18
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,040
us questions and then we're going to do

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,299
our best to answer them right that's how

20
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:09,799
it works

21
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:13,139
okay and so before we do that we'll just

22
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:16,499
do some very brief introductions so hi

23

Java SE and a Mian card and associated

28
00:01:34,649 --> 00:01:39,179
stuff at Oracle and opacity and room I'm

29

Andrew Haley I work at Red Hat but

30

that's not how I got to be on the

31
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,700
governing board I

32
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,889

that's yeah anyway sorry it's gonna be

36
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,549
like that isn't it I work for Red Hat

37
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:09,250
but I'm not on the governing board

38
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,989
representing Red Hat's I'm there as well

39
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:16,120
I'm there to represent you really I'm

40
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,510
the at-large member one of the large

41
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:27,519
members sorry and I'm there because the

42
00:02:27,519 --> 00:03:08,560
rest of the my name is mark I work on

43
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,459
Java oh and I work for Oracle my name's

44
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:19,900
not mark luckily um my name is John

45
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,329
 I work for IBM I'm the vice chair

46
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:24,760
of this find opportunity cake governing

47
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,150
board and I'm a distinguished engineer

48
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,549
and I own all of the runtimes including

49
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:33,819
Java at IBM and since we've been

50
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:38,230
participating since 2011 somewhere

51
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:42,040
around there yet open JDK and as most of

52
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,170
our Java runtimes actually built on all

53
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,690
of the class libraries from JDK we're

54
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,690
interested in continuing the innovation

55
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,940
at the community with community members

56
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,380
from this audience and others

57
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:11,720
all right so this is a QA we have all

58
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,000
the word anymore dear sofa mean sub

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:28,190
great I can't believe it okay and mire

60
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,660
it are you gonna run around with this

61
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,720
thing

62
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,310
sorry okay

63
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,020
well it's alright then people will have

64
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,979
to yell all right Sonny

65
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:08,390
yes the question which I should repeat

66
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,570
for posterity is what's happened about

67
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,880
the open bug databases because we were

68
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,630
talking about that last time or a couple

69
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:22,310
of years ago I think it was yeah we're

70
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:28,010
doing okay kinda sorta is is my take on

71
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,219
it

72
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:35,650
openjdk members can create bugs but

73
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,810
nobody else can other people go through

74
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:45,020
the Oracle gateway which I think I'm all

75
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,310
right in thinking that's the general

76
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,970
Java bug gateway rather than a specific

77
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,570
open JDK

78
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,360
bug gateway that probably makes sense

79
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,150
because end-users don't necessarily know

80
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,620
whether the bug that they've got is

81
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,620
specifically open JDK or generally Java

82
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,310
related there is a problem in that until

83
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,220
it's been triaged by staff at Oracle

84
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,430
it's quite hard for people to know what

85
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,050
the status of the bug they've just

86
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,419
created these that's an ongoing problem

87
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:21,860
on the other hand I think that the high

88
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,370
quality bugs that we need in order to be

89
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,000
able to act tend to be created by people

90
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,970
who open JDK members anyway because they

91
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,190
have the requisite knowledge to create

92
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:37,820
all of the information that we need and

93
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,360
to produce repeatable test cases and so

94
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,630
on I I would argue that this still isn't

95
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,780
an ideal situation but I do understand

96
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,859
the reasons for it

97
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:55,599
there's another party

98
00:06:57,719 --> 00:07:02,979
yeah and for posterity alexey shavelev

99
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:05,110
was saying the bar actually isn't that

100
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,949
high to get to author status and then be

101
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:10,809
able to get access to to the database I

102
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:13,449
should point out the that database is

103
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:16,059
one and I don't know exactly which year

104
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:17,169
you're talking about sunny but

105
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:19,569
definitely in the beginning we had a

106
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:21,520
bunch of work to do to actually move

107
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,219
from the legacy bug system that had been

108
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:27,459
used by the team and son to the system

109
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:30,039
which is being used today and so it is

110
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:31,449
the case that you can go and look

111
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:33,399
yourself and you know see the bugs see

112
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:35,020
what's happening see what responses

113
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,379
people have made and and the the only

114
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:40,629
thing that is a bit of a challenges if

115
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:42,279
you want to go and report about directly

116
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:45,159
and you haven't done a bunch of work and

117
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,899
made contributions and gotten some level

118
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,779
of status any of JDK community you need

119
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:53,499
to do that through the the sort of bug

120
00:07:53,499 --> 00:07:56,860
bug reporting system which is for Java

121
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,189
users in general and one of the the

122
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:02,409
reasons that we do have that at them and

123
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:05,019
is we get an immense amount of traffic

124
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:09,009
there there's really a lot and and and I

125
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:11,589
think it would not be ideal to have all

126
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:14,110
of that traffic going directly into the

127
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,119
open JDK bug database because there's

128
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:19,079
just so much noise

129
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:24,810
that's that's true the sorry Alexey

130
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,760
points out as I was just about to say

131
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,180
maybe you know 85 90 95 percent of that

132
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,140
art minecraft video driver bug reports

133
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,760
because when the VM crashes it gives you

134
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,510
the URL to that exact page and millions

135
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,490
of people dutifully file their minecraft

136
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,370
crashes so there isn't there's a third

137
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,660
channel that's worth mentioning it's

138
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,089
it's not you know it's not it's not a

139
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:50,750
huge source but it's not uncommon for

140
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,100
developers who are familiar with with

141
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,410
open JDK as a community but not real

142
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,300
active they'll show up on a mailing list

143
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,800
and say hey I've got this problem and

144
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,420
then somebody who does have access to

145
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,190
the database says oh yeah that's the

146
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,690
problem and they basically create the

147
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,580
book for it and that that happens on an

148
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,440
informal basis pretty frequently I think

149
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,669
[Music]

150
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,320
well yeah that's basically the algorithm

151
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,000
proud of getting involved is you you

152
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,560
find somebody to help you that's that's

153
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,030
true for many things a different

154
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,600
question in the back

155
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,669
[Music]

156
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,050
in terms of non x86 platforms how will

157
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:13,000
we do Marcus how are we trying to

158
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,390
remember what he said how are we doing

159
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,780
in terms of was it features and testing

160
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:25,300
and quality for them yeah well let's

161
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,570
just go through the platforms the non

162
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:33,250
x86 openjdk platforms there's PowerPC s

163
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,650
390x

164
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:41,050
they arch 64 and spark oh yes I suppose

165
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:41,940
so

166
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:55,080
ice awesome yeah the UM 32 stroke 64

167
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:02,380
port and the spark port are also tested

168
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:08,820
by Oracle correct smart works early okay

169
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,020
yeah yeah okay

170
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,630
yeah that's right yeah that's right

171
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,060
outside there we have a number of

172
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:37,580
partnerships in the community for things

173
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,930
like the a art 64-point s 390x I don't

174
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,670
know I mean you guys must be testing it

175
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,700
right along with the powerpc we're doing

176
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,680
testing at Red Hat I mean one thing I

177
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,960
can guarantee is that we're running the

178
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,060
regression tests and we're running T

179
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:53,810
CK's

180
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:58,850
so we do know that the other other ports

181
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,140
are compatible what we don't have

182
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,440
outside

183
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,310
oracle is the big bunch of heavy white

184
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,500
applications which i believe you're

185
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,370
doing regular regression tests on and

186
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,020
it's something of a challenge for the

187
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,090
community to pull together a whole bunch

188
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:22,400
of big stuff that we can use for testing

189
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,770
yes that's still very much a work in

190
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,350
progress and in order to get everything

191
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,570
up to the same sort of high level of

192
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:32,090
quality we're going to have to do more

193
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:35,210
of that in the open and i understand i

194
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,010
mean that a lot of your tests that you

195
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,960
do internally a proprietary anyway so

196
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,610
can't easily be opened up

197
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,780
kennel

198
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:04,290
okay I'm not entirely sure I understand

199
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:11,520
what doc I think you're asking why don't

200
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:16,770
we have HTTPS on on ion you know at the

201
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,750
very least for those of the people the

202
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,950
people can download the source code

203
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,600
securely and have some assurance that

204
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,270
there's no man in the middle giving them

205
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,760
source source code with bugs this has

206
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,780
been been bugging me for quite a while

207
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,610
and it's something that I've been

208
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,790
meaning to talk to the infer team about

209
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,050
just haven't gotten around to it yet we

210
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,410
should do HTTP preferably only on all of

211
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,330
the open JDK infrastructure we already

212
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:46,260
do it on the bug database I believe but

213
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,990
but for all the rest we we should we

214
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,970
should do the same thing so we do we

215
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,470
need region you need to work it out with

216
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,050
the infra team and you've a program you

217
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,430
know wait we need to it to a few

218
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,800
internal Oracle approvals to get but

219
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,180
should some certificates minted but

220
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,459
that's pretty straightforward so yeah

221
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:17,779
that's the place for the website volkert

222
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:31,290
whoa Volker says he's quite satisfied is

223
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,760
usually the guy who stands up and he's

224
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,130
got a list and he reads from the list

225
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,380
and he's good as he goes down that list

226
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,420
you know we're all everything like Oh

227
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:56,889
[Music]

228
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:09,330
and they serious about problems with my

229
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,740
question otherwise

230
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,850
[Music]

231
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,470
[Music]

232
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:25,150
are there any plans to do code scans to

233
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,790
catch code coming in that maybe you

234
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,830
shouldn't be coming in because it's

235
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,440
provenances is unknown or uncertain Turk

236
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,940
sees do you have another question or did

237
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,400
you want to comment on that another

238
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,450
quiet okay you're just being very

239
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:44,530
diligent very good or maybe you've got a

240
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:47,550
cramp in your stretching that's fine too

241
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:51,700
yeah so Z is the whole code providence'

242
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,880
naught and all that we don't we did

243
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,860
Oracle doesn't have any current plans to

244
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,610
do anymore

245
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:02,950
I you know doing you know do we as a

246
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,630
governing board need to encourage

247
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,230
someone to have plans for this you know

248
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,730
so far the honor system has worked

249
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,260
pretty well we you know we did catch

250
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:16,480
that one we got a lot of lawyers we scan

251
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,490
the shellac kind of everything so you

252
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,380
didn't think it's being scanned it is by

253
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:28,000
us however however you're welcome the

254
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,260
but it would make it would make good

255
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,360
sense because the province of the code

256
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,920
stuff happens I think we should have

257
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,650
some mob policy would help us for sure

258
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,750
but probably helps others because

259
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,980
there's a lot of ways to get the loan

260
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,720
code in the wrong place and you guys are

261
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,800
probably motivated the same I'm

262
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,090
surprised you're not scanning it for

263
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:47,340
another minute that's not here admit it

264
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,710
well I will say that there are a couple

265
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:54,100
of things I think in general code scans

266
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,960
are done whenever you know whenever

267
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,880
Oracle does an acquisition we look at

268
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,220
all of the inbound IP and so that

269
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,510
certainly was done in fact it was quite

270
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,610
humorous when that was initially done on

271
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:06,430
the jdk code because it immediately came

272
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,170
up with you know lots and lots of

273
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,760
warnings of things that were in some

274
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,540
other a bit of code because they were in

275
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:17,950
the JDK and and so so that's that's kind

276
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,589
of interesting no no no no I mean

277
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:23,520
because it was actually you know code

278
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,369
that was in the JDK which is a known bit

279
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:29,260
of code that's out there that people

280
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,250
shouldn't be popping and using

281
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,000
except this was the JDK so so that was

282
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,900
kind of interesting

283
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:40,970
thanks black duck in any event I think

284
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,110
you know one thing that's worth keeping

285
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,730
in mind I think you know many of the

286
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,610
folks who work in the open JDK community

287
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,580
work at companies who have pretty strict

288
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,260
rules around this kind of thing and are

289
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:55,040
pretty used to that I think that you

290
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,440
know we do have some people who are sort

291
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,300
of individuals who come and work that

292
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,340
you know may not be as used to that it

293
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,410
certainly is the case that the OCA has

294
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,440
information about what's expected so you

295
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,760
know when you sign up and say I'm going

296
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,890
to you know I want to be a contributor

297
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:12,110
to the open JDK one of the things that

298
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,000
you're saying is I'm gonna be diligent

299
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,100
myself about not taking code from

300
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,140
somewhere and and you know kind of

301
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,850
contributing code that's not mine

302
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:23,960
to to do with and and so so I think

303
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,690
there already is that you know whether

304
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,550
whether we it makes sense to put

305
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,900
something more in there I think you know

306
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,670
we've seen kind of one case where we had

307
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,190
a question you know possibly

308
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,260
surprisingly I don't think we're aware

309
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:39,200
of any others and and so you know my

310
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,390
feeling would be and you know what kind

311
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,770
of having a governing board discussion

312
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:45,890
here in real time is that you know

313
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,840
unless we start to see that this is

314
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,300
something that's clearly problem we

315
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,470
don't necessarily need to worry about

316
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:55,330
introducing additional friction

317
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,670
when that when I heard whatever these

318
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:05,260
things seemed like they might require

319
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,660
involvement by lawyers and creating yet

320
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,130
more process documents we cringe because

321
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:15,140
that's openjdk governing board at its

322
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,930
worst we don't do anything because it

323
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:23,720
takes so long to do anything the example

324
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,710
of that is is is something I thought I

325
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,140
bring us this nobody nobody asked yet is

326
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:34,040
the the brand new and thank God it's

327
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:40,280
finally proposed CSR project which was

328
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,360
just announced this week and and is sure

329
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,630
to go in effect and this is a finally an

330
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:51,470
open JDK process that corresponds to the

331
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:59,240
the evil secret society of of CCC that

332
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,270
people lived in fear from and now we

333
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:05,960
have we will have a process for doing

334
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,930
that without a huge process document I

335
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:13,190
am so so proud of mark of figuring out

336
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,680
how to put this into effect without

337
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,050
writing a hundred pages about what it

338
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,780
does just saying basically it does

339
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,790
whatever they these monster group would

340
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:26,420
like it to do I think it's us at our

341
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,580
best and I want to publicly congratulate

342
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:33,070
mark or finally putting

343
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,830
[Music]

344
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,890
yeah it's it's a joke that I think we've

345
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:48,640
made every year and there's a danger of

346
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,780
us getting to the end of the session

347
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,299
without saying this so I'll say it again

348
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:56,140
that in an ideal world our job as a

349
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,850
governing board is really not to do

350
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:01,270
anything we hoped that the various sub

351
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,660
communities within OpenJDK will be

352
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,340
self-organizing and they almost entirely

353
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,400
are yes there are infrastructure issues

354
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,070
which tend to cross boundaries of teams

355
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,230
and groups and organizations and all the

356
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:19,299
rest of it but we're just there to make

357
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:22,919
sure that the subgroups and all of the

358
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:25,570
stakeholders have what they need in

359
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,790
order to organize themselves we don't

360
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,180
want to run people's lives

361
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:34,549
[Music]

362
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,400
they are okay this is all to do with

363
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,570
making wineries available this is always

364
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:12,870
been a very vexed question I I mean

365
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,090
there are lots of really really good

366
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,940
technical reasons why that is very very

367
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,460
difficult to do and indeed the binary

368
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,770
may not necessarily work on your system

369
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:26,550
either canonical do it would Oracle want

370
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:32,250
to do it but publish publish early

371
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,990
access binaries on a more frequent basis

372
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,670
under what license is always the

373
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:43,980
question right I I think or Oracle you

374
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,920
know we've we've had directions from the

375
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,920
business side that shipping binaries

376
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,070
under the GPL is it's not something that

377
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,950
that Oracle wants to see believe it I

378
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,270
haven't you know I haven't asked that

379
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,980
question again for a couple of years but

380
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,390
I got a pretty firm answer the first

381
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:06,390
time I I asked it so I you know we've

382
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,310
are we've already been thinking that

383
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:11,670
that at four or ten it would make sense

384
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:16,140
for Oracle to publish Knightley's or

385
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,210
hourlies you know or whatever's on a

386
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,880
much more frequent automated basis and

387
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,070
of course the Oracle JDK is not yet it's

388
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,680
99% open JDK right it's not that

389
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,200
different but it's under the BCL which

390
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,580
some people won't be able to accept

391
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:33,360
maybe maybe other organizations you know

392
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,940
kate can step up and provide binary is

393
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,100
under under other license terms to don't

394
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,419
go to do in our reply to this

395
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:50,249
so okay so the dokas pointing out that

396
00:23:50,249 --> 00:23:54,629
the debian experimental and and end up

397
00:23:54,629 --> 00:23:56,159
in twos

398
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,359
what was the balloon to one

399
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,740
okay so the current current development

400
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,990
line and have been to will have OpenJDK

401
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:09,190
binaries are those updated frequently

402
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,809
mostly weekly so that's another source

403
00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:17,290
Linux binaries or specific to a bun -

404
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,240
[Music]

405
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:27,350
yeah so I think you just saw the reason

406
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,480
you don't get a nightly binary file for

407
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,190
JDK because there are at least five

408
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,440
build so you're talking about we have a

409
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,090
another one maybe I'll be the sixth and

410
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,820
there they are nightly available and

411
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,220
depends aware and so one two so

412
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,570
everyone's building from source and

413
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:44,510
there is no binary distribution from

414
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:47,410
open JDK that that everyone can then

415
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,700
beautify on so there's an opportunity

416
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,830
it's creating would like to do by

417
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,020
industry some project but I don't see

418
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,910
why that wouldn't be a problem to just

419
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:58,340
go build it but each of this five of the

420
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,110
company still do theirs

421
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,790
or we all have separate builds so I

422
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,020
think that's where you're seeing the

423
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:06,140
challenge but they're so so yeah and so

424
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,179
everyone was yeah there's 90s mine mine

425
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:11,120
mine and mine or well you guys hit on

426
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,220
the woman maybe Doug has it nightly I

427
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,960
don't know so the even dog is crazy

428
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,490
another nightly so I don't know but

429
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,950
there is because that you know cuz you

430
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,630
wanna did it work last night and dancers

431
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,090
wear what code did you get what are the

432
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,160
experimental guys have in that it's kind

433
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,080
of a mysterious thing so maybe there

434
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,640
could be a community effort around it

435
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,720
another bad story but you know and we

436
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,130
have of course it your problem you have

437
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,750
all sorts additional code that's not

438
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,870
part of the core yet so hopefully we'll

439
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,830
you can fix that too

440
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:49,150
[Music]

441
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:53,759
[Laughter]

442
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:56,649
so related to this question you you

443
00:25:56,649 --> 00:25:58,840
published not only the your Oracle

444
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,999
binary builds you also publish test

445
00:26:00,999 --> 00:26:03,249
results which is good but you only

446
00:26:03,249 --> 00:26:05,289
published results like which from that

447
00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:07,570
of the regression test suite but you

448
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,309
only published which results pass and

449
00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:12,070
which don't pass and it would be good if

450
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,220
you published the exact test details the

451
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,350
the the fires the JT alpha is because

452
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:20,049
Allah yes I spoke is wrong about this

453
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:22,330
and I just wanted to bring this to your

454
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,549
attention that a lot of tests I mean

455
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,470
maybe they get not executed on your

456
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,360
hardware on your platform and the result

457
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,450
it's always okay so you if the test ok

458
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,759
the test passes it it can mean it wasn't

459
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,779
executed it executed without errors or

460
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:41,460
something in between so a better

461
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,659
publication would be would be good more

462
00:26:43,659 --> 00:26:45,240
details

463
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,350
that's a good point

464
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:50,320
Publishing JT our files you technically

465
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,960
I don't think would be hard we would

466
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,580
probably run afoul of some of the same

467
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,980
issues we were having with the

468
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,710
experimental submission forests in that

469
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,990
we have to scrub test logs for internal

470
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,220
host names and other stuff that we're

471
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:06,190
just not allowed to to reveal but maybe

472
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,019
maybe we can somehow combine those two

473
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:10,570
efforts and if we have a general test

474
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:12,190
you know test results scrubbing filter

475
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:15,070
we can use it in both systems so yeah

476
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:18,669
it's a good idea I think we're coming

477
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:21,970
towards the end of our slot and Foster

478
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,529
and staff are going to get rather

479
00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:27,789
impatient with us so while this is all

480
00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:29,440
very interesting I don't want to stop

481
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,720
anybody talking if there's one more

482
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,580
really quick question and then I think

483
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:38,639
we don't go on

484
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:46,670
with additional ports coming into open

485
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:50,960
JDK aired 64 and PPC if there's a

486
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,180
security issue to to report there's

487
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:00,880
different owners whose should I talk to

488
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,970
[Music]

489
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:11,220
okay so that's that's actually one of

490
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,320
the things that mark discussed earlier

491
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,690
today was the work that we've been doing

492
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:19,830
on proposing an open jdk vulnerability

493
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,230
group and I think we're you know just

494
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:24,330
just about there there's one last detail

495
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,370
that I'm trying to get pinned down and

496
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,800
worked out but but the intent of that is

497
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,110
basically that we have a place where

498
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,000
it's very easy for anyone who finds

499
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,130
something to come and report an issue so

500
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,020
that all of the people who are involved

501
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,530
you know and potentially can can help in

502
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:44,850
fixing that issue are able to find out

503
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,980
about it and to sort of work with the

504
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,570
rest of that group and actually being

505
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:52,350
able to find a solution and so so I

506
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,390
think that's kind of how we'll try to

507
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,830
work that out and we have a little bit

508
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:58,350
of a you know sort of guidelines of you

509
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,510
know what people might be people that

510
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:03,150
would join that group and certainly you

511
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,340
know having responsibility for a you

512
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,990
know a popular port or something like

513
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,790
that would be one of those things I

514
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,350
think another is you know we've seen

515
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,720
this happen fairly often where there's

516
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,150
some possibly you know relatively

517
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,850
obscure branch of the class libraries or

518
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:20,460
something where a bug comes up and we

519
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,870
really need to be able to find the

520
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:24,750
world's expert on that and you know

521
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,280
that's not something you want to be

522
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,350
doing when there's you know potentially

523
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,120
a zero-day vulnerability happening right

524
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,670
so a lot of this is trying to get that

525
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,770
all mapped out and sort of work in

526
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:38,040
advance of potential issues coming in so

527
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,540
that you're able to act really quickly

528
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:43,080
and we can do that as as community in

529
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,710
order to keep all of our users safe at

530
00:29:46,710 --> 00:30:05,280
home yeah and I think Doug's right about

531
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,500
that you know what I will say for this

532
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,840
particular area is that

533
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,489
one of the things that's contributed to

534
00:30:11,489 --> 00:30:14,729
it is you know the need to have lawyers

535
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,679
for multiple parties kind of review it

536
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:18,389
in in the interests of trying to make it

537
00:30:18,389 --> 00:30:20,399
as good and tighten agreement as it can

538
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,179
be but also I think because we actually

539
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:26,429
do have some something that works today

540
00:30:26,429 --> 00:30:28,919
it works none optimally and it's mostly

541
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:32,070
non optimal for Oracle because at the

542
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,779
end of the day you know we end up

543
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:35,789
actually often having to have

544
00:30:35,789 --> 00:30:37,249
discussions with multiple parties

545
00:30:37,249 --> 00:30:39,629
one-on-one which really should be

546
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,369
everyone getting together in a room and

547
00:30:41,369 --> 00:30:43,799
discussing so it ends up being you know

548
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:46,320
far more difficult and expensive for us

549
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,259
then certainly I would like it to be and

550
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:51,179
and so that's one of the reasons we've

551
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:53,219
been pushing for this but it's it's

552
00:30:53,219 --> 00:30:55,529
taken a while and you know ducks ducks

553
00:30:55,529 --> 00:30:57,719
completely right on that one I think in

554
00:30:57,719 --> 00:31:01,379
the meantime you know what what we what

555
00:31:01,379 --> 00:31:03,509
I can say is we have seen situations

556
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:05,099
where people are unsure of where to

557
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:07,739
report a bug and then typically what

558
00:31:07,739 --> 00:31:10,080
happens is one of two things if they're

559
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,669
smart hopefully they figure out where

560
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:13,889
they got a build from and they report it

561
00:31:13,889 --> 00:31:15,659
to whoever that is

562
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:18,149
if it's Oracle with this IBM if it's you

563
00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:22,259
know red hat or or or never and and then

564
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:23,879
I think you know those folks try to deal

565
00:31:23,879 --> 00:31:26,399
with it as responsibly as they can in

566
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,679
some cases we've sort of seen people

567
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:30,089
scratching their heads and then you know

568
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:32,519
posting you know details you're open to

569
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:33,989
a potential security vulnerability on

570
00:31:33,989 --> 00:31:35,820
mailing public mailing lists which is

571
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,279
not a good idea like don't do that

572
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:39,599
please

573
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:42,539
you know while people want to hear hear

574
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:45,059
about the issues and try to fix them you

575
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:46,769
know we don't we don't want all of the

576
00:31:46,769 --> 00:31:48,839
details of those publicly known because

577
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:51,839
the bad guys are looking to so that's

578
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:53,789
the so what I would say for right now is

579
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:55,409
I think the best thing for people to do

580
00:31:55,409 --> 00:31:57,929
is try to report it to the people that

581
00:31:57,929 --> 00:31:59,369
they got a binary from and I know you

582
00:31:59,369 --> 00:32:00,330
know if you're the business of doing

583
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:03,749
that if you know it's a good idea where

584
00:32:03,749 --> 00:32:06,179
you have downloads to also have

585
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:07,769
information about how to report issues

586
00:32:07,769 --> 00:32:10,619
and how in particular to treat security

587
00:32:10,619 --> 00:32:12,970
issues

588
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,620
another way of saying that is even

589
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,970
though we do not have good rules in

590
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,950
place they have some good people in

591
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:21,170
place and things are not as bad as they

592
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:24,350
could be yeah things are not as bad as

593
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,360
they could think and I think that is a

594
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,940
really excellent time to end of this

595
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:40,840
session Thanks
