1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,490
hi so this will be the continuation of

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,350
the what we started and it's about in

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,850
general community and I'm going to show

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,320
some stats because the topic of the talk

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,580
was success stories and this is the

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,320
first year we'll start to gather some

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,480
stats in order to compile to see if we

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,919
are successful or we've not so we

9
00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:28,259
already presented very quickly what are

10
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:30,930
our main web sites and this is where we

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,590
are gathered and for example these are

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,320
some stats about this track and we had

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,239
much more submission than last year and

14
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,309
if any one of you have organizations

15
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,199
that you want to present opposite design

16
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:44,640
just contact us because we want to grow

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,190
the community and would be grateful to

18
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,679
have some much more speakers this is the

19
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:57,780
and members will see you next year how

20
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,989
much we grow and what are the

21
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:02,309
repositories we have our most successful

22
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:04,769
people is the job one in the double pole

23
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,790
you can make requests for designers to

24
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,160
help you with your project and sixty two

25
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,000
contributors already fix things on their

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,760
on the website or submitted requests for

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,060
us to help them in some way with

28
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:24,750
interface design or with logos we use

29
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,870
our C for communication so because we

30
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,820
want to be able to communicate with

31
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,530
open-source we're not using slack or and

32
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,350
we're trying to use open and on average

33
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,710
there are 60 users again questions

34
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,370
though you can reach us and maybe this

35
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,770
will be more finished channel two

36
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,280
together and not just once a year at

37
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,330
fordham and almost channel then in the

38
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,480
last year we tripled our tweets and we

39
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,240
usually tweet about episodes in design

40
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,250
and we have lots of photos and this is

41
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,038
how we keep track you can use it as the

42
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:11,280
hand said it's RSC because of the length

43
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,769
constraint so isn't you need to know

44
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:17,310
exactly where you can find this and then

45
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,410
let them collect them

46
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,530
it's very new and we try to find ways to

47
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,840
gather some money in order stupid

48
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,850
stickers and this is something that

49
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,560
happens for all the open source

50
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,680
communities finding a bit hard to reach

51
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,390
funding and we have to have backwards we

52
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,550
don't have any expenses currently but

53
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,470
it's very cool that if we have some

54
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:42,590
needs we can try to fill them with that

55
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,050
[Music]

56
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:47,420
more and our website this is the only

57
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,140
negative thing we have for the start

58
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,060
this year and that is the number of

59
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,950
articles so we could write more and try

60
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,100
to share more about designers that work

61
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,700
there and about communities in the

62
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,560
gather of events we also have monthly

63
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,400
meetings so you can also find their find

64
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,870
us its first Tuesday of every month if

65
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:21,380
you're interested and on the jobs so for

66
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,080
the whole period we receive 61 jobs

67
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,800
request and they're still active 45 so

68
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,170
we managed to close the difference and

69
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,820
Philips represent some of the other

70
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,200
things there this means that we are not

71
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,140
that successful in fixing every request

72
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,470
from every open source organization

73
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,540
comes to us but at least we are trying

74
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,940
and we have some some progress to show

75
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,090
you in that direction ok so I'm going to

76
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,230
let Felix to show you a bit of examples

77
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,269
of what we did in the past year

78
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:23,930
yeah so um where's the presenter so yeah

79
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,729
we had to open source design we love you

80
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:28,280
like if you're not just open source

81
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,979
coder or even just like managing open

82
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,680
source software we we all love you and

83
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,680
we love onions and peas I know it's not

84
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,199
an onion but you're gonna get it when I

85
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,800
come to this slide so one success story

86
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,289
was the Torah style guide I mean was

87
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:50,169
it's it's still ongoing so simply secure

88
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:52,820
posted it on on chalkboard that they

89
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,699
need someone for the for the store first

90
00:04:55,699 --> 00:05:00,470
a guide and picked it up and it was

91
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,410
eager to doing it so he even send them

92
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,510
an email and what happened is that they

93
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,090
didn't reply like for some time when he

94
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,590
said like hey I want to do this project

95
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,419
so he pinked him again and when they

96
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:15,669
replied they said it's a perfect match

97
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,979
[Music]

98
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:22,070
what happened is actually that of course

99
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,139
he did the standard thing right he

100
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:25,699
cleaned up the design into the awesome

101
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:28,610
job cleaning it out looking for a nice

102
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,169
font phase and really doing doing

103
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:32,660
awesome work but it's an iterative

104
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,610
process so they have P weekly meetings

105
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,830
and they found out it's a huge project

106
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,360
this huge community so it's not just

107
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,940
about some logo it's about getting all

108
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,130
this together and and therefore it's

109
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,419
it's nice to see that it's not just

110
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:46,400
another logo but a bigger process

111
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,550
involved and speaking about it it's like

112
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,979
it was a paid job and they even now

113
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:55,039
started up a UX team for four tours so

114
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,139
actually there is coming design into

115
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:58,789
another open source project business art

116
00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:01,310
which is awesome and alien now will

117
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,800
continue to work with the guys over

118
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,870
there so this is a very nice success I

119
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,960
would say a different kind of success

120
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,479
would be the open forum mascot so open

121
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:13,310
farms a project also in github and they

122
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,470
started about thinking hey we

123
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,710
you might need a mascot for a project

124
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,500
and there were some proposals but yeah

125
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,000
it didn't come very far so Simon is also

126
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,010
a part of our community said like I'm

127
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,930
gonna post a job on an open source

128
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:33,680
design and then this guy found it on our

129
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,640
job board

130
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,180
Sam done and he is not part of

131
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,280
our community so he just found it on our

132
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,090
website and this was his second proposal

133
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:49,340
and it stuck pun intended so so what

134
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,470
happened then is amazing because you can

135
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,840
see now in really an iterative and open

136
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,490
process over there because they said hey

137
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,150
we need some legs right it should so

138
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,310
next but then they don't look that nice

139
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,650
so do other legs con let's do this and

140
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:05,960
then they said like ok we have to work

141
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,610
on the eye so what kind of rice do we

142
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,860
want to meet or use and then still it

143
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,300
was thinking like ok but what's missing

144
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,100
someone that something's missing anyone

145
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:18,440
has an idea what's missing there's no

146
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,060
transparency in the wings so they made

147
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,800
transparent wings and you see the

148
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,550
difference is changed quite much and but

149
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,130
the big thing is the the community

150
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,840
working on this this was all in one

151
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,090
issue this one guy doing most of the

152
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,520
work but he he really appreciated all

153
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,050
these people coming together and helping

154
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:40,700
him doing this great thing and that's OB

155
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,760
the fine final product and we have a new

156
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,890
member in our community now like he's

157
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,830
now part of open source design and

158
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,190
that's that's great so now this word

159
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,110
like two very visual things and I really

160
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,930
advise you to check out vellum socks you

161
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,060
give this morning but because it's not

162
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,710
just about the fancy logo it's not just

163
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,600
about the digital stuff like we have so

164
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,520
many many experts here that can help

165
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,860
your open source project for example

166
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,400
like doing new complete new widgets or

167
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,729
software structures there or they are

168
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:15,290
there was this proposal for at least

169
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:18,260
four redesign of the whole web page so

170
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,479
the architecture behind it and you x and

171
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,390
y a visual of course as well so I would

172
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,180
say that that open source design our

173
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,340
success is really that we connect

174
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,430
Jesus like with the open-source coders

175
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,950
and community and and that's what it's

176
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,690
all about like we are lively community

177
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,419
this was just this Friday when we come

178
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:42,039
came together to have a nice fun event

179
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,090
yeah and I hope you give us some

180
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,400
feedback and I think we have a little

181
00:08:46,400 --> 00:09:33,440
bit I would say of course we like most

182
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,780
of the designers here try to do work on

183
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,390
open source like so they try to use open

184
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,310
source I must admit I don't use open

185
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,220
source for all of my work but I try to -

186
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,750
especially the stuff where it's about

187
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,170
data right so that's why I'm also part

188
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,150
of the design team at next cloud so I

189
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,860
really believe open source is an

190
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,080
important step and there are options

191
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,790
that's the that's the thing there are so

192
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,350
many open source projects even for

193
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:01,160
visual design or UX design or else for

194
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,410
example I think we should do we have a

195
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,450
list for tools I think we have a list

196
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:10,370
for tools right yeah so maybe we have to

197
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,430
put this out more so people find it you

198
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:22,400
can have a look there can also be inside

199
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,620
the feed bag just like puppet oh yeah

200
00:10:42,920 --> 00:11:00,510
so finding this we have three and it's

201
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:05,310
called the resources and the question

202
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:17,180
was how to get design out there I think

203
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,739
