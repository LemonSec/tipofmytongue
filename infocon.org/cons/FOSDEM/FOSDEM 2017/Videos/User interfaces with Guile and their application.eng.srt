1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,359
why not

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,030
to talk about user interfaces and guile

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,480
how to build them and what you can use

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,990
them for so that's what I'm going to do

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,919
can everybody hear me

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,890
we'll just everyone know how to change

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,540
so we can how do you do that in geeks

8
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:33,129
[Laughter]

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,649
what have you done

10
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,810
Gaber cute okay terminal we don't have

11
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,960
it

12
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:57,769
oh yeah the law that's these are just

13
00:00:57,769 --> 00:00:59,320
normal problems that you get when you're

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,180
doing presentations what works on your

15
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,379
machine never works on an overhead

16
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:05,829
projector

17
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:17,070
never know yeah plus I suggest we go

18
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:27,289
with it actually yeah f11 what is f11 do

19
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,789
the windows fullscreen

20
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:55,930
well off the screen like that yeah yeah

21
00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:00,670
okay well we'll run with it so what is a

22
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,970
user interface a user interface is the

23
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,300
means by which the user and the computer

24
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:11,039
interact typical examples are shell

25
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,590
which all can do slash Linux systems

26
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,450
have at least all that I'm aware of

27
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,210
the repple which is common for guy'll

28
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:22,680
users and of course graphical user

29
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,090
interfaces what does a user expect from

30
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,970
their interface normally they want a

31
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,540
means to give commands to the system

32
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,040
that you've got they've gotta be able to

33
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,720
tell the computer how to do something

34
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,380
and when to do it

35
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,750
they wanna means to determine the

36
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,840
current state of the system for example

37
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,800
in a shell you type LS to see what files

38
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,000
there are in the current directory and

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,300
it means to get normally they won't I

40
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,280
mean to get hints about what what

41
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,220
commands might be appropriate for the

42
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,620
current status so for example in the

43
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,260
shell you have modern shells anyway

44
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,940
you've got tab completion so you can hit

45
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,060
the tab key and it will give you a list

46
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,280
of possible ways to complete that

47
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,610
command

48
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,319
when you're talking about graphical user

49
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,080
interfaces the the users expect

50
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,739
something somewhat more a graphical user

51
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:30,150
interface user he normally wants

52
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,790
instantaneous but not when I say

53
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,930
instantaneous what I mean is automatic

54
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:42,030
updates without any perceptible delay

55
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,220
and that should happen without the user

56
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,079
actually having to do anything whereas a

57
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:50,040
shell user is quite happy to have to

58
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,510
type LS again to see what files may have

59
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,310
in the last five seconds appeared or

60
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,250
deleted GUI users don't like that they

61
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,220
want to see things when happen when

62
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,569
something changes they want to see it

63
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:07,379
automatically appear on their screen

64
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:10,569
they want automatic notifications of

65
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:13,930
successes in the shell we don't normally

66
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,810
like that if something works are

67
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,668
forgiving in a shell command we expect

68
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:22,960
it to silently return zero and get on

69
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,220
with the next thing we don't like it

70
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,380
saying stupid things

71
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,160
GUI users however prefer normally the

72
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,840
ones I've seen they prefer to see some

73
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,789
kind of confirmation that that command

74
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:42,780
worked they want explicit and verbose

75
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,400
notifications of failures so something

76
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,880
doesn't work they want a very verbose

77
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,680
pop-up or something to sell to say that

78
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,130
didn't work

79
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:57,410
context-sensitive prompts so they like

80
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:02,180
to see that something well if a command

81
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,010
is not appropriate to be entered at that

82
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:07,700
time then that command should not be

83
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,980
there the button should be grayed out or

84
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,560
not even there at all so that's

85
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,670
something that you have to think about

86
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,470
if you're writing a the graphical

87
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,640
interface is it is to only present what

88
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,570
is appropriate for the current state and

89
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:26,090
confidence in indicators if there is a

90
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,550
command that is going to take a long

91
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:33,070
time then they want some kind of

92
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,810
indication that the machine is doing

93
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:40,210
something and hasn't just sort of hung

94
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,990
so the exercise which I was charged with

95
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,090
undertaking was to write a graphical

96
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,990
installer for geeks' SD we want an

97
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:01,120
alternative to the shell or the repple

98
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,820
because currently and Geeks SD one the

99
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,280
the described way in the manual involves

100
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,440
a number of shell commands to partition

101
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,970
your disk setup file systems etc etc etc

102
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:21,050
and although many people are quite happy

103
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:26,840
doing that we think it would lower the

104
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,680
barriers to entry if people who find

105
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:36,260
those ways not so easy had a alternative

106
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,539
means of doing it so that's what we want

107
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:42,020
we want to give geeks SD a graphical

108
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,060
installer so that you can install it

109
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,510
from a bare machine but we don't want to

110
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:51,590
force that on people we want to still

111
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:56,330
give the traditional old-timers a way of

112
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:00,320
installing manually and I believe we

113
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,710
should actually allow for a compromise

114
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,310
so that if people like doing part of the

115
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,639
job themselves they can do but for the

116
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,750
other bits which are either too hard or

117
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:18,530
too much of a hassle they can give that

118
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:22,719
off to the program to do for them

119
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:29,170
so the acceptance criteria were that the

120
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:32,380
Installer should be written in Gaia

121
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,230
because everything else in geeks is in

122
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,330
garland Ludo wasn't going to make an

123
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:43,630
exception for me it should have a allow

124
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:48,610
a complete installation from nothing a

125
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:52,230
an empty machine with an empty disk

126
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:57,750
without having to use a shell or a rebel

127
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,150
but as I said to allow experienced guys

128
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,140
to use it if they want to

129
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,570
right it should be available in in their

130
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,520
own language in keymap there's just

131
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,760
nothing more annoying when you're

132
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:19,960
installing machines and the key layer

133
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,910
that you've got in front of you isn't

134
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,610
what what doesn't conform to what the

135
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,150
key map that's the machine is using so

136
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,980
if you're using a French keyboard you've

137
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,500
gotten you hit the AEK and the cue pops

138
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,909
up that's the noise the French people in

139
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:38,380
the same with the Germans with the Q and

140
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,380
the Zed being swapped over so we want to

141
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,479
be able to provide a way to get their

142
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:46,780
own language and their own key map it

143
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,030
should work on an 80 by 25 terminal

144
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,680
because some machines don't have

145
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,900
anything bigger especially some of these

146
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:57,540
little boxes that you see these days

147
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,990
and we want it to be intuitive as

148
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,760
possible so that you don't really need

149
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,530
anyone to tell you how to use it it

150
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:08,120
should be more or less straightforward

151
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,980
so how does it work when you're setting

152
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,030
up up geeks

153
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,430
well the tasks you've got to do you've

154
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:22,390
got a partition the disk must have at

155
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:25,240
least one partition you've got to say

156
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,780
what where those partitions or where the

157
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,670
file systems on those partitions should

158
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,670
be mounted you've got to tell them what

159
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:37,390
kind of file system that you want what

160
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:40,750
parameters timezone is something that

161
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,390
needs to be chosen for the system the

162
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,790
locale the default locale obviously uses

163
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:48,280
each user can set their own one but the

164
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,150
system locale needs to be chosen

165
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,230
packages there might be some standard

166
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,460
packages well there will be some

167
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,220
standard packages that should be

168
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,200
available for the entire system as

169
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,960
Ricardo said usually they're installed

170
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,700
most packages installed in the user

171
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,010
profile so they don't affect all users

172
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,340
services which I think somebody else is

173
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,750
talking about services later on so I

174
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,910
won't go into too much detail about

175
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,530
those but they need to be chosen

176
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,459
you've got to generate the config

177
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,160
normally you need a network because

178
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,570
Geeks is installed over the network and

179
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,350
then you've got to set the whole thing

180
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:36,670
in motion so those are the things you've

181
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,060
got to do

182
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:44,250
a couple of constraints for this

183
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,250
exercise

184
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:51,680
we cannot rely on any particular video

185
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:58,620
drivers being available because all all

186
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,570
systems these days have different videos

187
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:05,940
video systems so we cannot say this it's

188
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,440
always only going to work if you've got

189
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,480
an SGI or a ati or god knows what we've

190
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,880
got to use the the lowest common

191
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,130
denominator so that will be there when

192
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:20,990
you've got a pretty well a bare kernel

193
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:24,230
and of course we want to keep the the

194
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,370
installation image as small as possible

195
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,440
because it has to fit on a USB device

196
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,030
although they're quite large these days

197
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:37,200
they're not infinite so how does it look

198
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,040
so far that's really a shame that we

199
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,420
can't get the entire

200
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:58,720
yeah why is it that these overhead

201
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,890
projector systems never work

202
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,890
now I don't know

203
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,899
how about that

204
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,330
yeah that's more or less what it looks

205
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:29,120
like so there's a menu

206
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,900
on the main screen like I can

207
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,760
demonstrate this to two people who are

208
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,800
interested afterwards but actually

209
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,690
demonstrating it in real life now won't

210
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,370
explain yeah I don't think they'll be

211
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,130
the time for that there's the menu which

212
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,400
you can do the steps individually if a

213
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,110
user though doesn't want to do the steps

214
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,930
individually they can choose the bottom

215
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,530
one and it'll do everything and all its

216
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,820
dependencies all at once so that that's

217
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,000
the easy way for inexperienced people

218
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,280
but as I said we've got these commands

219
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,050
here

220
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:06,350
that's keyboard for f10 to change the

221
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:10,930
keyboard map f9 to change the language

222
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:14,330
so if you want it in German or French or

223
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,070
whatever you can or at least you will be

224
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,600
when the translators have done their job

225
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,460
and if you want a shell you can hit f1

226
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,250
and you will get out to a shell and when

227
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,140
you hit exit when you type exit in that

228
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,940
shell you'll come back to where you left

229
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:34,310
off and those those three hotkeys will

230
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,470
be available throughout the whole

231
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:39,080
process so you can you can do that at

232
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,530
any time

233
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,800
and because we can't use a video driver

234
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,180
we decided to use curses you're probably

235
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,579
familiar with curses it's it's a good

236
00:13:58,579 --> 00:14:00,589
new package and it provides an

237
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,230
abstraction around the terminal

238
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,360
capabilities each terminal in the world

239
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,889
has a different way of being controlled

240
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:13,910
and curses abstracts that out so there

241
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:19,250
is a common ye to for example draw a box

242
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,320
on the screen or put her or move the

243
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,990
cursor to position X Y on the screen etc

244
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:29,300
etc it also has a couple of higher-level

245
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,709
libraries which I might talk about a

246
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:33,769
little bit better but the main Curtis

247
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:37,670
library is a capi however as I said

248
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,649
earlier this has got to be written in

249
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:43,639
guile so fortunately there is a library

250
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:46,910
called or a package called guile in

251
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,769
curses I think that is there is Mike

252
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:50,540
Graham here well there he is right at

253
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,940
the back is the maintainer of golian

254
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:58,029
curses and that is what we've used and

255
00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:02,060
just very briefly going into how those

256
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:07,940
menus work in curses or Guilin curses it

257
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,120
has the means to display a menu like

258
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,180
this

259
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,290
the user can move up and down and select

260
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,440
items in the menu if you were writing it

261
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,230
in C that would be the interface you've

262
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:29,380
got well you have to create a an array

263
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:34,390
of items populate that array with a name

264
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:43,300
and description and create the menu do

265
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,610
whatever you want with the menu and when

266
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,740
you've finished there it's your

267
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,649
responsibility to free that menu and the

268
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,180
lines that you can't see down here

269
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,730
because of this system you've then got a

270
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,550
free the the items if you don't want it

271
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,810
to leak memory

272
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:16,340
how do you do that in guile in curses

273
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:21,300
similar way well how would you do it

274
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,910
similar way create you and a list of

275
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:31,140
names list of descriptions then in this

276
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,850
case I've used a map and a lambda

277
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:39,590
expression to create a list of items

278
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:45,360
each of which is a appear and then

279
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,090
create your your menu here

280
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,920
so in theory you can you can you can do

281
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,580
that with dylon curses and there is a

282
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,260
similar thing for forms if you want to

283
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,720
make create a form entry system which I

284
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,990
have done my experience with them wasn't

285
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:17,230
that successful unfortunately I found

286
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,050
that first of all the the the the way in

287
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,449
which the forms and menus in in curses

288
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:24,730
are structured does not really lend

289
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:29,890
themselves to scheme I found that they

290
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:36,340
were somewhat inflexible the early

291
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,200
versions were actually tended to crash

292
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,790
every now and then especially when the

293
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,610
garbage collector ran at inappropriate

294
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,830
moments and I said Mike there are a few

295
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,750
patches and it's got a lot better in

296
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:52,260
recent releases but I'm still not

297
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,600
confident that all the bugs have been

298
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,630
ironed out there are I have noticed

299
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:01,930
occasions where it works most of the

300
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,550
time but then when the garbage collector

301
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,050
runs when you don't expect it then

302
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:09,300
suddenly it crashes and even if those

303
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,980
that system that those problems have

304
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,650
been fixed as I say I don't really think

305
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,500
that the the interface lends itself to

306
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,640
to scheme programming I'm not absolutely

307
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,800
convinced that all the memory leaks have

308
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,250
been perhaps we can talk afterwards Mike

309
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:33,160
but yeah I don't mean to pour cold water

310
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:41,920
on your efforts but either rightly or

311
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:46,960
wrongly I decided not to use the forms

312
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,930
and menus libraries of Guilin curses I

313
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,700
wrote my own which did an equivalent

314
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,940
thing

315
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:01,300
small set of modules which did more or

316
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,650
less the same written entirely in scheme

317
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:09,040
but using the base curse asunder I'm

318
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,250
still using guile in curses and just not

319
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,640
using their forms and menus

320
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,000
implementation okay thank you

321
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,160
well that's an example of how how it

322
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,770
does it as we're running out of time

323
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:28,930
I'll skip that but I think that way is a

324
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,030
lot easier than the previous way that I

325
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:36,430
showed you human factors we have to

326
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:41,530
consider in user interfaces

327
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,960
this was an early screenshot of

328
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,750
something I sent out for testing they

329
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,860
are not this this this form actually got

330
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,060
a lot of negative feedback from the

331
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,680
people I asked to test and I think the

332
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,200
reason is obvious there are too many

333
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,780
controls on this screen some of them are

334
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,710
not even appropriate people didn't know

335
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:05,310
what these buttons were going to do

336
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:10,000
which is understandable it doesn't say

337
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,420
in fact well check actually Rams fsck

338
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,920
Wright will run mkfs to create the file

339
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:23,860
system and know recreate does that yeah

340
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,240
exactly if you don't know what it's

341
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,980
going to do then it's probably a poor

342
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:31,690
design so that's that's one lesson that

343
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,420
we learned don't write your user

344
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,630
interfaces too complicated now and

345
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,400
that's been in the new version that's

346
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,630
been changed quite considerably tech

347
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:50,440
info yeah we we need to have a system to

348
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,390
turn tech info into something that

349
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:55,000
curses can display those of you who are

350
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,760
familiar with guile know that there is

351
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,640
this existing function called techy

352
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,570
fragment 2's techie which converts

353
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,380
things like again we can't see in the

354
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,690
whole thing

355
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:13,260
the days of our lives with the bold in

356
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,500
tech info into something more scheme

357
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,809
friendly which is a start of a paragraph

358
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:23,789
the days of and in bold is our and we're

359
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:26,610
no longer bold here that's existing in

360
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:32,850
in tech info in guile I had to write a

361
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:36,780
new procedure to actually turn this

362
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:40,610
thing into something that curses will

363
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:44,190
will play nicely with and I can show you

364
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,500
that later

365
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:51,390
if you're interested there's so the

366
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,460
status so far what's been done well

367
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,559
we've got a reasonably complete curses

368
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:59,070
based installer and it has been send out

369
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,100
for first testing users have reported

370
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,470
that it it does work they have been able

371
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:07,169
to do a complete installation of geeks

372
00:22:07,169 --> 00:22:12,049
SD without having to resort to a shell

373
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:15,330
and I believe those people have used

374
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:19,169
different hardware and different network

375
00:22:19,169 --> 00:22:22,470
systems etc etc so it basically all

376
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:26,580
works problems well as I said earlier

377
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:31,710
the the problems that I find is that we

378
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:36,240
are lacking on guile bindings another

379
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,330
problem I found is that we there is no

380
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:46,350
current way that I've found to get the

381
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,880
kernel to tell us when something has

382
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,220
changed I have to polish and that has

383
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,380
that is not a nice way of doing things

384
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:59,880
this is a brief procedure I wrote to get

385
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,650
around the first problem that the lack

386
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,230
of bindings what I basically have to do

387
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:07,380
is screen scrape command so run a run a

388
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:12,120
command in a pipe and collect the output

389
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,700
that's comes on to stand it out and then

390
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,280
post process it also not nice but it

391
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,460
does work here's how I do my polling for

392
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,399
changes just use seek

393
00:23:23,399 --> 00:23:28,019
cig alarm to Paul every second again not

394
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:31,299
nice but it works but

395
00:23:31,299 --> 00:23:33,580
what can one do without the the

396
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,480
infrastructure what we don't have yet in

397
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,710
the system is mouse support that that

398
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:44,559
I'm trying to work out but I'm actually

399
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,470
finding that unfortunately it's a where

400
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:51,279
I've got a whereas it can work on the on

401
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,230
a next term you don't have a next term

402
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,789
when you boot up your machine you've got

403
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:57,669
a a frame buffer terminal and I'm not

404
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:03,070
sure if that can work with that LVM full

405
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,470
disk encryption that's not supported as

406
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:08,409
yet and neither is adding users a lot of

407
00:24:08,409 --> 00:24:09,700
people said they want an option to add

408
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,480
users I normally consider that a post

409
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,309
installation tasks but some people like

410
00:24:15,309 --> 00:24:16,659
to do it at the time of installation

411
00:24:16,659 --> 00:24:20,889
apparently here's some ideas that some

412
00:24:20,889 --> 00:24:22,480
people came up with that and I'm still

413
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,889
trying to work out whether they're good

414
00:24:23,889 --> 00:24:26,499
ideas or not it's all tips so that if

415
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:28,929
you hover the mouse over a button that

416
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:32,049
you might get some text saying what it's

417
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:33,700
going to do well you're you select that

418
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,409
button without actually activating it

419
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:41,350
questions ok so perhaps the new

420
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:45,129
assistant and can camp so yeah ok

421
00:24:45,129 --> 00:24:47,639
questions

422
00:24:51,220 --> 00:25:05,990
yes and you also considered writing the

423
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,860
adverse things

424
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,200
well that's basically what garland

425
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,590
curses does or tries to do and and but I

426
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,690
didn't have that much trouble writing

427
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:28,530
the the menus in Kyle when I wrote my

428
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:32,310
own libraries to do that I had lot more

429
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:35,940
trouble using the the guilin curses

430
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,510
interface

431
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:53,409
[Applause]
