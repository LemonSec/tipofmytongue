2
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,960
so I get enough time and this stone was

3
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,310
going out and so we're going to do that

4
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,249
in the UK so my students very scraped

5
00:00:38,249 --> 00:00:46,649
and I teach searches into the internet

6
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:47,940
things and I'll talk about what that is

7
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,769
and particularly to radio technologies

8
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:51,809
and but I'm also interested in how that

9
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:53,969
can reach out to communities and

10
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:55,499
actually have an impact rather than just

11
00:00:55,499 --> 00:00:57,359
being as you'll see in a minute to buyer

12
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:08,700
stuff or whatever was a stupid

13
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,100
thing to do

14
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,958

[Music]

16
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:28,220
it's just

00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,310
[Applause]

18
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,430
[Music]

19
00:01:47,350 --> 00:02:04,460
okay and has a cultural impact so nice

20
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,820
and fast

21
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,480

[Music]

24
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:43,130
you can automatically buy it from Amazon

25
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,910
it will be sent you

26
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,230
devices just so we can buy something or

27
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,670
control the heat in our house cause if

28
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,760
that's really it's been quite shorts or

29
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:32,910
anything that's useful devices enabled

30
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:49,470
just buying things right you know some

31
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,300
washing liquid I now have to go to the

32
00:04:51,300 --> 00:05:04,860
shop and do that and use them to tell us

33
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,870
whether it's safe to go obviously cantos

34
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,100
is structurally safe but it could

35
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,810
measure gas levels things are bad those

36
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,080
leaks

[Music]

38
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:48,159
[Music]

39
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,770
into an IP packet and then transferring

40
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:08,260
it onto the internet on the Internet you

41
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,910
know it's just a P at that point

42
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,480
services you know to their back wall and

43
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,150
then you bring it back out by node or

44
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:43,390
MQTT or technology it's already exists

45
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,290
you know we know how to do all that

46
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,970
stuff whether it be Amazon or Microsoft

47
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,010
or whether we have open source software

48
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:51,310
we know how to do these things and the

49
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,840
interesting part is that is the way that

50
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,030
it kind of works as a conduit and feeds

51
00:09:55,030 --> 00:10:02,560
us food just feeding strain to a web

52
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:02,800
page

53
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,560
you know whatever consuming that data

54
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,019
you need to make everything you've

55
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:41,570
consumed many when I started work on

56
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:46,670
this project sitting in the yes my

57
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,370
device is read useful actually want to

58
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,660
change your lives and everything we need

59
00:10:50,660 --> 00:11:02,510
together present that data to understand

60
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,519
he just read specials or make Delta to

61
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:10,250
come true when you're technology

62
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,430
experience that way is not a way that

63
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,139
they can consume that data very easily

64
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:17,029
so that's just as important to think

65
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:19,370
about that we can generate huge amounts

66
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:22,190
of open data but they just sits there on

67
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,410
these cloud servers and it's just not

68
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,579
someone's and that's something it's

69
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:42,130
really not that useful to the world I

70
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,569
think that's an important aspect to look

71
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:47,740
at and I need to do

72
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:04,329
and so forth just really just like any

73
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:06,040
other cloud service that is designed

74
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,010
specifically in this case to handle that

75
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,560
the Internet traffic coming internet

76
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,480
things traffic coming from these lower

77
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:19,209
devices it's only really useful if we

78
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:20,740
can make applications that are actually

79
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,430
really making use of it and present it

80
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,190
[Music]

81
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,660
like on things Network because I think

82
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,950
it should be more than that you know it

83
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,269
could be to produce reports you know if

84
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:32,440
we want to actually change legislation

85
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,040
in the UK then it's about actually

86
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,320
producing reports and stories that we

87
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,790
can take to the government or the

88
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,380
council initially so we're working with

89
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,420
to persuade them to consider legislation

90
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,839
against landlords who are not compliant

91
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:49,089
to damp for example you know we respect

92
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:51,510
two things

93
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,780
so before we get to my lab Spencer don't

94
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,300
reduce one name for this this is why I'm

95
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,819
sure many of you already have this

96
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:14,770
devices to in the wild for potentially

97
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,440
years like you know Microsoft and we

98
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,150
want to let them hear that they talked

99
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,160
about five to ten years would be a

100
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,510
reasonable battery life for these kind

101
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:26,830
of devices two years because you know

102
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,300
it's hard to you know to imagine doing

103
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,740
the same job in ten years you know or

104
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,640
whatever but we want them to be able to

105
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:39,569
take them out into the environment and

106
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:44,500
and maintain them that's important as

107
00:13:44,500 --> 00:14:19,180
well because of communication going to

108
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,930
go into that too much

109
00:14:27,440 --> 00:15:11,220
this is looking at the second it is so

110
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,570
different from ours in terms of

111
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:16,470
geography and really interesting to see

112
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:35,490
what they found the coverage you know

113
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,170
you don't have to be in an urban space

114
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,910
to make this work potentially you know

115
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,560
people have talked about doing it with

116
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,060
rhinos I don't if it's just an

117
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,230
advertising thing on their website but

118
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:46,740
they in Africa or in Dublin they've been

119
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,510
trying to look at or in Ireland at least

120
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,880
looking at dolphin populations and stuff

121
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,279
and things and Molino so it doesn't just

122
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,380
have to be in the city it is very rates

123
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,220
okay

124
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,930
the bandwidth we're talking is pretty

125
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,850
low and so we're not gonna be streaming

126
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,250
high-definition 4k video of any no

127
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:09,079
that's not the idea of this thing okay

128
00:16:24,280 --> 00:17:33,830
you know it's pretty nice because it

129
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:37,160
ones frequency penetration which you

130
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:43,010
don't get to five which has just been

131
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,080
announced apparently three times the

132
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,470
size of range can't get my hands on the

133
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,180
device I couldn't tell you that's true

134
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,060
or not at least that's what they're

135
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,310
claiming so there's going to be

136
00:17:54,310 --> 00:18:32,590
over the next few years everyone gee

137
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,200
that seems to be the big topic in UK you

138
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,550
can get lots of money if you're doing

139
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:40,920
research into 5g or some startup so

140
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,210
rates and things

141
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:45,820
it's a point where their communication

142
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,620
you know I don't know maybe 100 meters

143
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,970
of it brains maybe your signal doesn't

144
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:51,160
work as well that sort of thing but you

145
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,200
can extreme 25 video channels at the

146
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,260
same time or whatever proposed someone

147
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,300
actually told me they understand some

148
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,710
company they said I'll application is

149
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:00,670
that you're going to go to the train

150
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:02,740
station and download five hasty videos

151
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,370
concurrently

152
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,909
[Applause]

153
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:24,419
[Music]

154
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,480
place cell towers around and in

155
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,510
particular there's a thing but most

156
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,770
important thing is that you can take

157
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:27,740
this handoff between one transmitter

158
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:32,300
receiver you don't want to drop because

159
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:36,370
you know you know how annoying is to do

160
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,420
science size does cost money there's no

161
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,560
getting away from it whether it comes

162
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,820
from a government funding or company

163
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,990
fundings and these estimate the cost

164
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:51,140
50k years to build in terms of research

165
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,250
and everything got into that's the

166
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,630
potential where you're talking about at

167
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,850
least that's what they tell me

168
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,350
so these are things that you and I are

169
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:01,330
going to be putting up around a space

170
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,240
[Music]

171
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,960
you can often duplicate messages and the

172
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,550
back end will take care of that and

173
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:25,790
things carry cause okay we're just

174
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:28,250
sending data and of course you all know

175
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,040
from your your courses on tcpip or

176
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,110
whatever whose message which we send

177
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:35,150
there with on your back can we send it

178
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,700
you know we came up with some very

179
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:51,830
strange I'm not saying that

180
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,950
pretty small computing smart things over

181
00:21:54,950 --> 00:22:00,230
the years pockets devices to the drought

182
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:08,300
okay we need to worry about any of that

183
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,620
you know it's interesting how it works

184
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,840
but really even just say that's pretty

185
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,190
much the same way that you would send

186
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,620
and communicate on the internet and send

187
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,370
over things okay

188
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:13,579
[Applause]

190
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:49,309
[Applause]

191
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,250
systems to do that so we can absolutely

192
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:59,910
say there's not that and interesting

193
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:18,799
technology not only open source

194
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:46,620
[Applause]

00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,830

[Music]

197
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:53,750
maybe humidity

198
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:34,819
[Music]

199
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:42,509
that can connect to and I think which is

200
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:44,100
what most of us have been using to date

201
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,989
doesn't have that to service in it's

202
00:26:45,989 --> 00:26:49,440
only in the 1.1 specification where

203
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,179
they've started a + b which does have

204
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:53,700
this and and very important is

205
00:26:53,700 --> 00:27:02,639
unfortunate that's one of the things

206
00:27:02,639 --> 00:27:04,799
it's in unlicensed spectrum at the

207
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,690
moment and so that's advantage but we're

208
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,039
now talking about going to licensed

209
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:10,230
spectrum and this that's what they

210
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,730
mentioned amber said maybe one day we

211
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,309
would that was in that tweet so and i

212
00:27:14,309 --> 00:27:15,330
don't know the implications are that

213
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,009
concerns me because then maybe it's not

214
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:19,230
open to all they do that i don't know

215
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:25,220
the implications of that there's some

216
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,549
sorts of things

217
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:56,149
to get a region some time we also want

218
00:27:56,149 --> 00:27:58,879
to make sure that device battery life is

219
00:27:58,879 --> 00:28:01,729
great and that has an implication on how

220
00:28:01,729 --> 00:28:30,830
you're arranged this per second that you

221
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:37,309
can transfer small amounts of data you

222
00:28:37,309 --> 00:28:38,539
know we're not going to be sending I

223
00:28:38,539 --> 00:28:54,679
mounted a tow package to send it will

224
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:55,759
change channel and a pseudo-random

225
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:58,309
fashion and the most important thing

226
00:28:58,309 --> 00:29:01,029
this is that

227
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:55,250
[Music]

228
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:15,479
[Music]

229
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:26,759
[Music]

230
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:35,750
maybe 30 seconds of online time per day

231
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,490
you can send particular if you imagine

232
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,350
that you only sampling five every five

233
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:43,219
to ten minutes and

234
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,500
and when the gateways were probably the

235
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,090
information and not allow devices to do

236
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,710
that so they could have fair use policy

237
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:51,290
and again we have to see how well this

238
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:54,830
scales and particularly if we want to

239
00:30:54,830 --> 00:31:08,120
see industrial applications and that's

240
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,840
just exposed and then they have these

241
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,790
surface taxes Autopia that actually do

242
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:18,940
the communication so visual sensors

243
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,780
physical the physical communication

244
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:24,110
really nice things as you say is that

245
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:29,480
the chips on the device are the same the

246
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,250
chip for the radio so that makes it

247
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,570
really nice in terms of I mean the

248
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:34,280
overseer that's really the weather

249
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,940
Center for dinner you know is reduction

250
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,820
that and throw yourself and so it makes

251
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,590
it quite hard to actually build I mean

252
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,540
less your good lets or staff that bird

253
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,960
to NPC be specifically for the radio

254
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,150
the data side it does keep the costs

255
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,130
down relatively down you know they're by

256
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:55,520
euros for a fully Frances stack

257
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,860
including the M zero six on here for

258
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,020
example compared to cyanide signals

259
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,360
which the devices are really cheap but

260
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,620
the gateways are actually very expensive

261
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,870
that they're then had this symmetrical

262
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:17,360
chipsets and if you imagine in chorus if

263
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,550
you buy them in bulk in the thousands

264
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:22,600
and that price would drop considerably

265
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:33,470
I miss my coche yeah this is it a little

266
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,399
bit and that's what I don't think is

267
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:40,369
really needed but inside is the nature

268
00:32:40,369 --> 00:32:44,179
itself the physical regulatory plus and

269
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:49,309
M cortex which runs the surface tack for

270
00:32:49,309 --> 00:32:51,769
the for the lower one and so on it's not

271
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:52,940
hugely complicated

272
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,700
most of the chip is going to be handling

273
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,039
the different bands and the noise

274
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:03,590
reduction and things are there so sta no

275
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,299
amounts and then first one I don't even

276
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:07,789
buy yeah doesn't remember the name that

277
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:11,679
they're very similar chip to this

278
00:33:18,230 --> 00:34:03,499
it's really straightforward you should

279
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,119
connect so it just means that as you

280
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:06,559
connect your device and that the first

281
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,409
time it will set up the keys and connect

282
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:21,409
and so forth and things devices

283
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:24,549
connected to a single application

284
00:34:24,549 --> 00:34:27,379
information about dancing for example

285
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:29,929
and each application is unique and this

286
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:32,299
will connect the device and the

287
00:34:32,299 --> 00:34:41,510
application to application so you and

288
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,530
then you can start to read that

289
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,699
information fairly straightforwardly

290
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:52,879
it's a thousand lines of very simple C

291
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,909
code you know or C++ code so from

292
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:57,980
Arduino stuff there is really basic

293
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,720
stuff there's nothing going on here I

294
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,390
mean the the protocol to do the serial

295
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,040
protocol is you know it's just basically

296
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,150
8 t commands Tunis

300
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:06,480
and really cheap and PCB which is not

301
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,040
that difficult and you're willing to

302
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,480
send it to China you can build your own

303
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:15,590
board and exactly what you want you know

304
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:34,530
code you can be mr. bascomb connect to

305
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:43,800
any more network any way to go okay and

306
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:51,320
so this is network comes into play

307
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,560
this translates into an IP packet and

308
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,600
then it's forwarding it from and if you

309
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:24,660
actually look to funk it so it's not

310
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,050
there now

311
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:28,370
is it there oh yeah

312
00:37:45,890 --> 00:38:45,900
is running literally I would say in 20

313
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,930
minutes

314
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:50,029
[Music]

315
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:23,880
okay and that was including posters of

316
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:29,100
packing to the UK these will discover

317
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,600
that these on that great for if you want

318
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,880
to get much better range and so we do

319
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,400
use full way for deployments around the

320
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,680
city and that causes much for the

321
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,119
antenna that it does for that software

322
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,680
but it really depends on what you're

323
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,550
trying to do and what kind of reach

324
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:44,390
they're trying to do

325
00:40:03,849 --> 00:40:09,939
is a pretty nice cloud service and a

326
00:40:09,939 --> 00:40:11,619
bunch of things whether working out

327
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:13,719
where to send it to and things about

328
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:19,150
where they're brokering interface which

329
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,650
is just accessing their donors to give

330
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:24,609
you a view in the middle here is bits of

331
00:40:24,609 --> 00:40:27,969
code you know mqtt or node interface for

332
00:40:27,969 --> 00:40:30,939
getting the data out of their databases

333
00:40:30,939 --> 00:40:34,089
into your system to take that on and

334
00:40:34,089 --> 00:40:35,799
they have a nice if you want to just

335
00:40:35,799 --> 00:40:36,819
test your back-end

336
00:40:36,819 --> 00:40:38,979
or your application then they have these

337
00:40:38,979 --> 00:40:41,439
TNS ETL tools for example which allow

338
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,049
you to emulate or fake sending updates

339
00:40:44,049 --> 00:40:46,420
to the system without having to ever

340
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,130
desk the device connected to the Gateway

341
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:49,660
so it's really nice because that means

342
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,549
you can then test your system you know

343
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:54,099
in a nice orthogonal while you make one

344
00:40:54,099 --> 00:40:55,479
bit of work and check every bits working

345
00:40:55,479 --> 00:40:56,709
and then bring them together just

346
00:40:56,709 --> 00:40:59,430
standard style better

347
00:41:46,839 --> 00:42:04,849
some to this this lines of constant

348
00:42:04,849 --> 00:42:11,420
JavaScript it's really right mqtt I must

349
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,279
know I don't use them very much but if

350
00:42:13,279 --> 00:42:14,990
you're into them and that works too and

351
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:18,200
you're there often is actually useful to

352
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,270
real people and their stuff so it's

353
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:27,549
great so minutes left sound just insane

354
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,250
then well this is a fact on the Evening

355
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:34,579
Post

356
00:42:34,579 --> 00:42:36,020
we know how newspaper start to present

357
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,420
those facts but let's just assume this

358
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:41,020
is true today

359
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,279
[Music]

360
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:50,009
and tracks and everything and you will

361
00:43:50,009 --> 00:43:52,679
see the device IDs and that she leads to

362
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:56,699
monitoring it connects their node to the

363
00:43:56,699 --> 00:43:58,469
TTL network and then basically starts to

364
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,929
consume that data and show it's really

365
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:03,390
simple and really useful you know so

366
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,650
much of mutual application that you can

367
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:08,420
do to monitor things and so forth

368
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:18,570
so this is infrastructure for bass and

369
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:20,430
it's not just me as data left for me but

370
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:21,870
I've reached out we have a bunch of

371
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:26,000
other people both business people and

372
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,680
from research both universities in

373
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:32,690
Bristol that are now working on this and

374
00:44:35,000 --> 00:45:11,840
maybe I won't have to pay for questions

375
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:15,350
there's a question back there

376
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:28,040
so what kind of distant

377
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,829
[Music]

378
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:53,079
[Music]

379
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:15,270
[Music]

380
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:44,369
yeah but that's the sort of range thank

381
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:45,930
you very much for this great talk you

382
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:47,760
mentioned that you can use the same chip

383
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:53,220
on the note and the Gateway but you can

384
00:46:53,220 --> 00:47:26,130
only have one channel at a time I think

385
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:29,960
you do have to have the most expensive

386
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:37,530
anything since you already have m0 and

387
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:39,240
see you on the

388
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,540
can you use that for

389
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:48,370
[Music]

390
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:24,340
I I just like to remark that in the

391
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:25,990
Netherlands we have already quite

392
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:28,270
extensive network of this and as a

393
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:31,150
website called TT n map rhetoric that

394
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:35,080
way you can look up if there's games by

395
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,800
near you and you can also see the signal

396
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:46,900
strength and you can if you if you're

397
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,490
curious and let's play with it didn't

398
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:50,710
you can look up the locations of the the

399
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:55,620
gateways and also see

400
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:01,630
[Applause]

401
00:49:24,539 --> 00:49:26,849
so in particular since you mentioned to

402
00:49:26,849 --> 00:49:29,579
you the osprey pi and early on and I've

403
00:49:29,579 --> 00:49:31,680
noticed that all the delight that

404
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,209
there's a lot of code to be found on

405
00:49:33,209 --> 00:49:34,650
github that you can just check out

406
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:36,749
download and run on your devices that

407
00:49:36,749 --> 00:49:38,579
many of those are using incompatible

408
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:40,289
license like in particular for Raspberry

409
00:49:40,289 --> 00:49:42,420
Pi they're usually always using the wild

410
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:44,430
PI library which is under a GPL v3

411
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:46,680
where's the lowlands tag is actually

412
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:51,449
under some GPL v2 license yes I was

413
00:49:51,449 --> 00:49:53,339
wondering in particular with a viewer on

414
00:49:53,339 --> 00:49:55,410
Linux on the Raspberry Pi is there any

415
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:57,180
work going on for writing like real

416
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:00,469
criminal drivers for Laura
