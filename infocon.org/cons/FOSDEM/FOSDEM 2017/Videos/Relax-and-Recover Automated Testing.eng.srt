1
00:00:05,059 --> 00:00:08,900
hello my name is Cassie and Alison I

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,420
will give a presentation about relaxer

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:19,039
recover automated testing so Who am I

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,900
I'm one of the main contributors of

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,359
relaxer recover and it's the first time

6
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,060
in my life that is almost nothing had to

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,789
say about relaxer recover at other

8
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:32,130
people who were doing that for me but is

9
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:39,750
very nice so in this talk so for those

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,610
who are not aware about to relax in

11
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,330
recoveries

12
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,880
it's an bare metal disaster recovery

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,930
tool written in bass and it's open

14
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,460
source of course it's perfectly

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,660
integrated with other backup tools open

16
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,680
source and commercial ones and it's able

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,970
to cloning cloning to different kind of

18
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:08,159
methodologies like V to V P 2 V and so

19
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,370
on and it can work with very complex

20
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,950
systems and very large enterprise

21
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,870
systems so it's very scalable as well it

22
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:25,380
is being used in very big companies one

23
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,760
of the companies where are to consume to

24
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,360
see almost daily they have I think 10

25
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,670
tiles lining systems using rear and the

26
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,549
nice thing is that disaster recovery in

27
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:40,409
disaster recovery image is very flexible

28
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:42,510
as well in the sense that it can boot

29
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,190
from the network and boot from the ISO

30
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:48,680
can boot from USB and even from the RAM

31
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,630
that's more for testing but ok it's away

32
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,190
so that was the introduction of rear and

33
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:00,360
that's it the fact for me but a lot to

34
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,180
concentrate in this talk is testing

35
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,880
because real is now 10 years more than

36
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,310
10 years old the testing was always a

37
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,280
pain because it's so little hinges it

38
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,830
can run on let's say Linux distributions

39
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,280
like Debian boon to red cat Suzy and so

40
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,250
on and so on

41
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,600
it can also rent on different hardware

42
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,400
you have ProLiant you have Delson and

43
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,370
everything has different tweaks and that

44
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,070
makes testing very difficult above all

45
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,800
because it integrates so fluently with

46
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,100
different backup metal-on-metal ologies

47
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,390
testing all of these things is

48
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,680
incredible difficult furthermore as a

49
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,050
set we can build from different methods

50
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,310
also that gives an extra layer of

51
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,580
testing that should be done and every

52
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,340
time that we make a new release that's

53
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,090
the problem

54
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,620
because it's impossible to test

55
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,380
everything and it will never be possible

56
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,230
to test everything that's why we have a

57
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,470
very good user community and when we

58
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,270
bring out something that breaks then we

59
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:12,430
know it very quickly so the bottom line

60
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,660
is testing is and will always stay a

61
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:22,269
pain but we try to overcome first levels

62
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:25,239
let's way of speaking and get some

63
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,250
automated testing done so it's always

64
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,180
finding the right balance between

65
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,860
continuous integration continuous

66
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,700
development and continuous testing we

67
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,150
already have for many many years thanks

68
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,550
to Susan and the open builds services

69
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,950
that daily effect when real snapshots

70
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,850
are changed and Remy there's something

71
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:54,310
in to hit that automatically then the

72
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,440
nightly builds are made and the new or

73
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,480
pians are available it's all right there

74
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,519
for many years so that was the first

75
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,330
step what we do now is every time that

76
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,590
there is a new built we can

77
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:12,010
automatically test it of course we may

78
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,950
not forget our contributors most of the

79
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,228
contributors are here the active

80
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:19,680
contributors we have many many

81
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,290
contributors over the last 10 years but

82
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:26,140
like in many open source projects to do

83
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,789
something and after a while there are

84
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:29,860
gone because they have other kinds of

85
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,589
interest it is fine

86
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:37,249
and important to novice hiccup is our

87
00:04:37,249 --> 00:04:40,490
friend our master code is there even

88
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,369
though our website is over there issues

89
00:04:43,369 --> 00:04:47,209
are there and also the the free support

90
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:50,059
is on there and it's issues and we also

91
00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:52,990
have commercial support if required for

92
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,879
big companies that something's useful

93
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:01,909
okay why don't we start today's

94
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:05,360
automated testing because if customers

95
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,969
who have a support contract the demand

96
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:11,509
quality tests so that was the first step

97
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:14,389
that we did is to introduce these

98
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:17,499
automated testing to have at least an

99
00:05:17,499 --> 00:05:20,300
improving level of contribution and

100
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,990
improved level of stability in our

101
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,300
software that's that it didn't break or

102
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,429
if it breaks that we know it in fact

103
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:31,639
immediately that it will break so what

104
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:34,509
not the automatic testing effect do

105
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:37,159
twelve create and disaster recovery MX

106
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:40,159
it will create a backup it will built

107
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:43,729
and recover first machine over Big C

108
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:46,159
Network booting it will recover it

109
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:48,559
automatically and it will restart and

110
00:05:48,559 --> 00:05:51,199
after the restart your recover

111
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,389
virtual machine is exactly the same of

112
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:54,979
the client you will see it in the next

113
00:05:54,979 --> 00:06:01,519
slide this is a test configuration so

114
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:04,789
what do we see here we have the client

115
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:07,189
we have the server and the recovery fee

116
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:12,860
and this is all done via vagrant and you

117
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,279
have the hypervisor on the top we have

118
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:18,529
two networks and they hit AP network and

119
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:20,959
in private network we will be using a

120
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:26,509
private network the newspaper ins we

121
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:31,099
need a Linux host system and because you

122
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:35,300
could be using a Mac or or Windows but I

123
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,550
am for the moment I'm just say Linux and

124
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,409
may be fragrant and we need us a

125
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:45,200
hypervisor you can use Oracle Virtual

126
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,700
or delivered this system is using

127
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,430
lipfird I have a second PC with me with

128
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,720
VirtualBox and it works equally well so

129
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,760
what we are we doing when we say

130
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,580
starting the script we will start up the

131
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,670
two VMs the client and the server the

132
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,730
server is effect what it is saying it

133
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,740
will contain the backup it will contain

134
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,410
also the pixie built environment and the

135
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:16,280
client to exist startup install rear the

136
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,070
latest version of course start to backup

137
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,710
the backup goes to the server and it is

138
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,140
down it will automatically sit down the

139
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,170
client start up the recovery VM and that

140
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,930
starts effect to recover it pixie boots

141
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,530
from the server and recover the rear

142
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,950
completely automatically then the

143
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,450
recovery is completed it will shut down

144
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,120
and reboot and then it will be able to

145
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,450
start up by itself at least that is the

146
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:50,350
purpose of course I already set this

147
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:55,000
these are the requirements what we need

148
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,040
so also the automated testing is in

149
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,700
simple scripting it is also available on

150
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,060
github you can see it here it's on my

151
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,130
personal name account you can see it

152
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:14,060
also on them back you just have to close

153
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,830
it start the script and you can log in

154
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,840
as vagrant you can leave it login as

155
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,590
root with the password vagrant and

156
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,130
that's it

157
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,229
like I said you can lock it in different

158
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:36,708
ways to the PM's you can use vset over

159
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,799
you can use the oracle virtualbox or the

160
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,479
lipfird for some an answer

161
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,360
huey where you can just use secure cell

162
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,649
or use the vagrant commands if it is

163
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:56,510
required this is 50 VNC viewer and we

164
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,279
will use the vs if you will with leopard

165
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:01,130
if personal buffs are used normally the

166
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,589
Huey that is delivered by Oracle

167
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:08,510
VirtualBox okay enough talk let's do the

168
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:19,220
demo so here you can see the script it's

169
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,480
a simple script effect

170
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,920
it's a sequential script has some

171
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,310
commands because it is the purpose to to

172
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,620
test the distribution the oldest abusive

173
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,070
for the moment implemented this CentOS 7

174
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,029
because that was required by the

175
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:38,199
customer and we can have boot methods

176
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:41,240
the default boot method is Pixy building

177
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,000
and the other one that will be supported

178
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,480
very soon as I though it is support

179
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,670
because I also have a workshop using ISO

180
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,089
so it's just a matter of time to

181
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:54,769
implement it over here

182
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:56,630
it's already half implemented but not

183
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:01,370
complete the boot server can be changed

184
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,430
by default is the server VM but if you

185
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,690
have another requirement you can

186
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:11,079
overrule it the same with the provider

187
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:13,699
but I will start the script and you can

188
00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:15,320
talk afterwards

189
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,930
during the script because this is

190
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:21,140
lipfird the 9-speed is the provider the

191
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,970
default is VirtualBox because this is

192
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,829
LeFort I have to say - P LeFort and

193
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:28,250
that's it

194
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,190
the rest I can keep as default to start

195
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,330
it

196
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,029
what is this kid doing now you can see a

197
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:38,820
tongue button it will start up the two

198
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,649
VMs the client vm in the server VM so

199
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:47,910
this is pure fragrant work now regulat

200
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,329
is starting up the two VMs I could have

201
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:53,300
cheated and already started demanding

202
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,010
I'm from but it is not really quick

203
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:59,329
enough to do a job

204
00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:02,310
so once the the two clients are up and

205
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:07,019
running you will be seeing hopefully

206
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:12,230
soon all right

207
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:16,320
they are provisioned I don't care to

208
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,839
have an update for the moment so we wait

209
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:20,459
for 5 seconds because you can interrupt

210
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:22,860
now you have the status you have to see

211
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,110
in the to client and server VM are

212
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,470
running we do an test if the network is

213
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,800
ok yes we can communicate with the

214
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,560
client and the server VM

215
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:39,270
and now or the client vm inside client

216
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:42,810
vm we will put the latest rear snapshots

217
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:48,200
limits from the open SUSE build services

218
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,800
that is what you see now you see

219
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,270
hopefully it will be working because I

220
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:58,649
haven't tested test it is a new one so

221
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:01,440
this is live advice I'm not cheating

222
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,300
that's not the video this is life and so

223
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,810
it can't fail

224
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:10,440
alright what you see here over there

225
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,610
that is the ATC we're local

226
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,310
configuration so what do you see here

227
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:22,800
that using pixie booting backup is using

228
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,399
Tower I will use the the backup URL is

229
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,540
going to the server 15 to the TFP boot

230
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,760
area but under the TV boot area there

231
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,880
will be the server area where to store

232
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,510
the backups and you can see here the

233
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,980
pixie recover mother's unattended that

234
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,839
means just continue

235
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:49,050
if you wonder why here for the colonel

236
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,680
command line I use net that if names

237
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,040
equals zero that's not required for

238
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,900
LeFort but that is required for

239
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,240
VirtualBox otherwise it will be using

240
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,490
deff bias deaf names for its network

241
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,030
interfaces then it will break your

242
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,360
automated recovery okay

243
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:16,890
it will now starting the life ISO pixie

244
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,620
boot image this mate it's already stored

245
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,700
you can see it here and now it is busy

246
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,980
with the backup that will take a minute

247
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:36,000
or two I hope it's not updating itself

248
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,950
very frequently it's easier but okay

249
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:44,870
that's not too serious that takes longer

250
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:49,280
backing up takes longer than recovery

251
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:09,310
yes I've no doubt sir that that will not

252
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,530
work it's just a matter of

253
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,740
implementation implementing it and

254
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:26,470
putting time in it to test it out like

255
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:29,430
you it's quite new yeah yeah okay

256
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:32,320
finally the client is halting we will

257
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,430
start any up the recover VM it will try

258
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,880
to pixie boot it will there are two

259
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,100
interfaces the DHCP interface and

260
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,900
there's the private network it will

261
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:48,040
stride the page CP interface that won't

262
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,660
work then it will try the second

263
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,930
interface this is your third if you use

264
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,510
VirtualBox you cannot pick C both from

265
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,760
the server VM we must pick support from

266
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,230
the host that's a limitation of

267
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,540
VirtualBox but okay that's why I said be

268
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:08,230
using Linux okay that's the manner it's

269
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:12,850
already starting the Rama image system

270
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,860
is almost upper running I'll recover

271
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:20,260
image it's already formatted to the hard

272
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,470
disks and it's already restoring the

273
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:25,650
data

274
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:29,910
within within a minute or so it will be

275
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,660
finished or that will do that it will

276
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,110
trigger the server don't figure Eight's

277
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,029
the pixie bit configuration it says okay

278
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:41,399
now you have to do the next time from

279
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,040
the default hard disk not from the

280
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,410
network and not from the RAM a bits

281
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:52,050
that's already don't they restoring the

282
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,230
data it's rebuilding its initial Ram

283
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,929
disk because it was a cloning it's not

284
00:15:57,929 --> 00:16:00,839
exact the same disk size so it wasn't

285
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:03,899
cloning this was a v2v my case that we

286
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:07,679
did so it was not an exact copy it was

287
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,470
an other size of disk otherwise we would

288
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,009
never rebuilt our initial Ram disk it is

289
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:19,860
not the same if it was the same that

290
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,350
takes longer than the recovery of the

291
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:26,209
date okay

292
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:30,689
okay once this step is done then we are

293
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:36,139
finished just installing decrypt

294
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:39,139
bootloader

295
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:59,430
take the seconds that's snow me if you

296
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,990
want to interact and to to check

297
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,360
something

298
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,329
even that is tunable what okay that's

299
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:14,849
still fair thirty seconds waiting yes

300
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:18,680
that's all for seen most of these

301
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,829
variables you have to look in the slash

302
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:26,630
users less shares less rear / twelve

303
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,940
default that come file all the used

304
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,610
variables are defined over there we have

305
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,500
some description and your harness is

306
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,800
very good in making good descriptions

307
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,280
long descriptions I'll do it I know

308
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,040
mostly some comments effect it's not

309
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,850
welcome inspector

310
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,700
because prefer some longer comments and

311
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,130
a longer text effect and I do agree that

312
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:57,890
it says useful oh okay system is a

313
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,420
restarting so the recover VM is now

314
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:04,410
completely restored and rebooted and we

315
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:07,410
have our prompt so the latest reef snaps

316
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:10,470
applause okay this should be able to

317
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:14,760
login that's what this vagrant and if

318
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,730
you do an IP - a the password should be

319
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,920
ten this was the client so we are now

320
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,570
the exact copy of the client

321
00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:28,929
like any check on the recovered system

322
00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:34,839
like checking it yeah yeah oh well this

323
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:37,389
is not so I haven't not foreseen this in

324
00:18:37,389 --> 00:18:41,349
the talk no see you have it I will close

325
00:18:41,349 --> 00:18:50,109
this QE and this will stop you got with

326
00:18:50,109 --> 00:18:52,869
the help again you will see that is a

327
00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:57,249
minus T from test directory the test

328
00:18:57,249 --> 00:19:03,190
directory is this here so these are the

329
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,349
tests they are not for me they are

330
00:19:05,349 --> 00:19:08,320
coming from ratchet ratchet is using

331
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,389
these tests to validate here if they

332
00:19:10,389 --> 00:19:13,690
want to update something and that that

333
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:18,210
use big lip and it already works but

334
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:22,710
probably don't have time to do something

335
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:28,929
wait a second don't stop I will cheat a

336
00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:31,169
bit

337
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:40,220
I will help to recover and they'll start

338
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,850
up to the client again because it's

339
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,850
fragrant even if the recovery is now the

340
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:52,120
client it will still wanted to check the

341
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:57,380
vacant client I am so sorry about that

342
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:06,830
but ok starting up this ok then I go one

343
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,919
back I will use the the smallest test

344
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,130
which is very simple one it's just the

345
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,220
checkout the layout of your system is

346
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,080
something it has been modified if you

347
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,690
update the kernel for you modify or

348
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:24,110
increase your one of your volumes then

349
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,179
it's required that you rebuilt effect

350
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:30,169
and do real limits alright so the test

351
00:20:30,169 --> 00:20:35,600
directory so that's the check change

352
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,690
disk layout so automated I have to use

353
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,150
the lippert

354
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:48,700
and the test let's use this one

355
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,820
absolutely

356
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,070
let's invalidation test so now we can

357
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,289
skip the bringing up difficult because

358
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:00,110
they are already up and running so that

359
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,559
goes quicker

360
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,330
voila it copies effect the the complete

361
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,730
test to the client and if they already

362
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:13,880
did the test so the first test is done

363
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,760
and what I do I've copied the test back

364
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,299
to my host system here so every time I

365
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:23,149
run a test I also have a copy of the de

366
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:26,870
la hang so that was a very quick demo of

367
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,580
the tests that are possible the other

368
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,500
test will take this more time because it

369
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,190
will all also make either images set the

370
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,880
eyes or images or even make them back up

371
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,350
but I don't have time for this to

372
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:42,049
demonstrate this demonstrates what the

373
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:43,010
possibilities are

374
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,700
of these test scripts prepared by Red

375
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,590
Hat there's this recommended Baker lip

376
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,269
but yesterday I ran something new with

377
00:21:53,269 --> 00:21:55,880
bats and I will use that in the future

378
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:03,289
also yes everything is all hatred it's

379
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:06,470
made available by records also ok are

380
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:13,940
there any questions whatsoever was it

381
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,330
clear enough it was a nice talk from the

382
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,740
Cardinals and then you have to say too

383
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:23,320
much system did it for me

384
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,678
any question

385
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:39,470
okay yeah the question was do I have an

386
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,120
estimation how much time it will take to

387
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,750
bring another system distribution effect

388
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:48,669
into the rear automated testing if it's

389
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:52,429
an RPM base it's rather quick if it's

390
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:55,190
for example in w1 that will take a bit

391
00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:00,399
more time but I take only a few days

392
00:23:00,399 --> 00:23:04,970
yeah a few days would be enough because

393
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:07,429
the bit tautology is exactly the same

394
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:10,220
it's maybe in the other packages and for

395
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,520
the rest it's exactly the same the

396
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,490
framework is there so it's only just a

397
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:19,190
matter of making the right moves in fact

398
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:22,210
yeah any other questions

399
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:26,179
no and I'll thank you very much for your

400
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:29,000
time and please enjoy the rest of the

401
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,220
day here or outside

402
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:39,650
[Applause]
