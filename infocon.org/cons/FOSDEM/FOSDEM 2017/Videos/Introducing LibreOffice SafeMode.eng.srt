1
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:09,610
yeah hello my name is Simona Burt I'm

2
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,539
working for CIB and I'm presenting the

3
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:14,920
libre office safe mode that's a new

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,289
feature in the 5.3 release and first of

5
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:22,539
all what is safe mode and why do we need

6
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:26,020
it you may say no safe mode from Windows

7
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,970
when you have a broken driver you start

8
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:32,229
the safe mode to fix things it disabled

9
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:34,059
some drivers and some other things or

10
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:36,309
Thunderbird and Firefox have a safe mode

11
00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:40,449
which disables their add-ons and other

12
00:00:40,449 --> 00:00:44,559
stuff and yeah we had similar similar

13
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,719
problems in libreoffice users were

14
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,489
reporting problems that we couldn't

15
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:51,339
reproduce and often they were related to

16
00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:54,309
their user profile containing some

17
00:00:54,309 --> 00:00:56,949
broken settings there is an example of a

18
00:00:56,949 --> 00:00:59,679
buck Report Writer crashes on startup

19
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,859
because it fails to parse the registry

20
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:05,369
modifications which contains the

21
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:10,630
settings the user changed yeah and for

22
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,240
users it was the only solution often was

23
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,030
to find the folder which contained the

24
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,270
user profile and delete it there was no

25
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,880
real method to restore such a broken

26
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,540
system and so PDF published attender

27
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,240
last year to implement such safe mode

28
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,930
and as CIB we did that and yeah the goal

29
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,870
was to allow the user to identify and

30
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:39,000
fix issues with a user profile

31
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,829
yeah how do I access the safe mode there

32
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:47,880
are three options the people office has

33
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,520
a in the menu and a command and the help

34
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,250
menu restart in tight in safe mode then

35
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,929
you have a starting a new entry in

36
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:58,799
Windows LibreOffice safe mode and the

37
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,149
command-line option that should be - -

38
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:05,609
this is auto correction made it into a

39
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:11,580
long - yeah you can use that on Mac OS

40
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,360
or Linux yeah what are the features it

41
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,930
uses a temporary clean user profile and

42
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,180
it also disables hardware acceleration

43
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,680
like OpenGL and OpenCL temporarily

44
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,510
because there were some users experience

45
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:34,230
experiencing crashes due to OpenGL and

46
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,440
startup and when you can't start the

47
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,069
brofist you also cannot fix that only by

48
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:43,709
manually editing the configuration files

49
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:47,970
so this is one thing we made easier with

50
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,329
that yeah and when you start it you get

51
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:53,880
a dialog which has some options to

52
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,730
restore and reset several things I will

53
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,130
show it later and I will show some use

54
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,030
cases what you can do with that and also

55
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,190
it allows to create a zip file from the

56
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,069
user profile which helps if you want to

57
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:10,169
send it to someone or upload it on the

58
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:12,870
bug tracker for the developers to

59
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,410
analyze it

60
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,870
yeah okay the first use case Libre

61
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,550
Office doesn't start what should I do

62
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,550
and before we told users try deleting

63
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,650
the folder containing your User Profile

64
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,519
yeah where's that folder it's differs on

65
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:31,379
different operating systems so they

66
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,510
needed to find that and rename it or

67
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,140
delete it

68
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,569
that means all their settings are gone

69
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:40,530
or their extensions are gone and also

70
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,720
their workbook is gone the words they

71
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,700
added to the old workbook and yeah stuff

72
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:53,190
like that like that another thing that

73
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,489
could be broken is that it doesn't start

74
00:03:56,489 --> 00:03:59,880
because OpenGL has a crash and in that

75
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,890
case the users need to put some setting

76
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,549
in the Windows registry or edit the

77
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:11,160
configuration manually yeah and now we

78
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,690
tell them start Libre Office in Safe

79
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,720
Mode with one of the methods I mentioned

80
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,320
and then you already see it will

81
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,389
hopefully start up again then it was a

82
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:25,460
initial with the user profile and then

83
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,380
yeah you have some options to disable

84
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,820
hardware acceleration or to reset

85
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,740
certain parts of the user profile or the

86
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,789
whole profile ok another use case I

87
00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:43,080
changed option except salon and now only

88
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,880
brofist doesn't work anymore or it works

89
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,460
different than before and before the

90
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,289
solution was yeah delete your user

91
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,100
profile and now we can tell them go to

92
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,840
the safe node and restore the last

93
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,930
configuration backup yeah there is a

94
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,320
backup functionality included it is not

95
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,860
yet enabled by default in 5.3 but you

96
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,320
can enable it by setting some any

97
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,110
options I will explain that later

98
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,220
hopefully it will be enabled for the

99
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,510
next three days yeah

100
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:17,050
save for configuration because no one is

101
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:21,580
configuration by accepting roses

102
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,360
yeah there will be backups created when

103
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,060
you change something you can configure

104
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,850
what will be included in that pick up I

105
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:36,250
will explain that later okay the next

106
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,440
use case I broke everything I want to

107
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,020
reset LibreOffice to factory settings

108
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,900
before the solution was delete your User

109
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,300
Profile with the same problem where is

110
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,850
it now they can go to safe mode and

111
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:53,740
select reset entire User Profile in the

112
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,130
next use case my extensions that my

113
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,910
extension don't work on my extensions

114
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:04,270
does don't work anymore okay right where

115
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,540
they are breaking things before you

116
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,420
could go to the extension manager and

117
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,600
disable or remove them one by one it's

118
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,210
fine now you can disable or reset them

119
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,660
with one click or even remove them the

120
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,920
user extensions at least there are three

121
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,500
types of extensions bundled the

122
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,720
extensions we deliver with Reaper office

123
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,780
then you can install them shared for all

124
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,140
users and for these two types you can

125
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,750
only disable them and for your own

126
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,730
extensions which are only for the

127
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:46,510
current user you can remove them ok

128
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,810
another use case I was requested to send

129
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,210
my user profile to some bug tracker or

130
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,970
some supports this support system where

131
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,280
do I find it and before we had a nice

132
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,400
wiki page with instructions and windows

133
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,180
is it is an update our libreoffice for

134
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,960
user and linux it is in the home

135
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,540
directory that config libreoffice for

136
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:16,780
user etc and now you can find that

137
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,640
folder by going to the site mode and

138
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,130
there isn't a transaction there you

139
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:24,010
can't can either click a button to show

140
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,470
the user profile folder or directly

141
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:30,310
I create a sip file out of it and yeah

142
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:34,260
do whatever you want with that zip file

143
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,910
okay that's the part of the

144
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,660
configuration for the backups yeah there

145
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:46,810
are various any properties and default

146
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,620
values are what is given here default

147
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:56,200
means in current master hopefully 5.4 so

148
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,920
secure user conflicts it the backup is

149
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,700
enabled yeah

150
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,860
false means it's disabled it's clear

151
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,350
then secure user config compresses

152
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:12,120
whether it will be compressed or not

153
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,240
number of copies the next item is how

154
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,160
many copies are kept the default is two

155
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,030
and then there is a nun and item secure

156
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:25,390
user config mode there are three numbers

157
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:29,200
you can give 0 1 and 2 0 means it

158
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,179
backups only the registry modifications

159
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,159
yeah like the changes you did to the

160
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,080
settings then one is the default it also

161
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,200
backups auto correction also texts basic

162
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,250
scripts configurations databases

163
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:51,010
registry scripts templates and the word

164
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:55,210
book yeah we excluded certain parts like

165
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,940
the gallery because that might become

166
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,210
too big and too means the whole user

167
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,710
profile whatever is in there because

168
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,900
extensions can also put content there

169
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,160
maybe you want to backup at to secure

170
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,970
user contact extensions is the feature

171
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:17,650
that remembers the last state of

172
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,440
extensions that worked so if you install

173
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,070
a new extension and LibreOffice doesn't

174
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:28,350
work afterwards you can restore the last

175
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,270
working state of the extensions meaning

176
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,520
that extension will be disabled at the

177
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,209
next start

178
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:39,080
okay how to customize the default values

179
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,020
the these values are defined in the

180
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:46,260
installation directory program as office

181
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,790
dot ini' or as office RC on linux don't

182
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,209
know what is in Mac OS then you can use

183
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:58,890
the - and command line Parramatta

184
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,640
parameter to give each of these options

185
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,130
a different value or a normal

186
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:11,899
environment variable okay now the demo

187
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:18,810
okay so I just start by customizing my

188
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:22,110
toolbar and somehow I managed to remove

189
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:32,390
all the icons there yeah and now I have

190
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:35,339
missing Mary lots of icons from my

191
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:41,459
toolbar then I can go to restart in safe

192
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:45,660
mode we start it's giving some Java

193
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,190
warnings because the other isn't

194
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,160
configured anymore and then I get this

195
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:56,670
dialog oh yeah I can restore the last

196
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,920
known working configurations on the

197
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,000
backup configure is can disable user

198
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,829
accelerations I don't have an extension

199
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:07,950
so it's disabled or disable hardware

200
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:15,209
acceleration extensions can be install

201
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:18,089
uninstall or user extensions or is it

202
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:20,100
the state of shared extensions or of

203
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,399
content extensions I mentioned all of

204
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,380
that what it means or I can reset to

205
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,260
factory settings there is an option

206
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,380
reset settings and user interface

207
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,899
modifications that might be helpful for

208
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:37,560
such a case as now it resets to bar

209
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,260
customizations menu bar customization

210
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,990
and also everything you changed into its

211
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:46,170
options you might want to do that if a

212
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:48,050
new release contains an

213
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,230
updated menu bar or an updated toolbar

214
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:54,320
if you customize it before you won't get

215
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,029
the update so you can reset it here

216
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:01,070
yeah or in my case I could restore the

217
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,920
toolbar as it gets before life changes

218
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,640
and restart and there it is as it used

219
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:12,589
to be okay now once again in safe I can

220
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:14,510
use the Start menu and treat and show

221
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:23,079
that there it is Libra of a safe note

222
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:37,290
yeah or no safe mode try again

223
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,880
okay we found the back okay so there's

224
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,090
the advanced section says if you

225
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:51,950
experience problems that cannot be

226
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,900
resolved by using the safe most you can

227
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,000
get help it leads to the LibreOffice

228
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,010
site where you can report it back or

229
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:02,450
whatever has links to forums then there

230
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,630
is show user profile which opens the

231
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:10,100
folder with a user profile folder safe

232
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:15,100
mode contains the backed up user profile

233
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,130
yeah because this is the clean user

234
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,470
profile now and then there is create zip

235
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:23,860
archive from user profile and then you

236
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,480
can have it there yeah that was the

237
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,730
Liebherr of a safe mode are there any

238
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:36,780
questions yeah

239
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,720
because there is no Yahveh configuration

240
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:52,210
anymore I might have something that uses

241
00:13:52,210 --> 00:14:09,040
Java yeah probably I have something that

242
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:23,610
requires yeah

243
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,210
yeah

244
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:35,929
yeah we hope this is to add interface

245
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:53,429
backup system yeah not to exceed some

246
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:55,909
value or

247
00:15:01,319 --> 00:15:05,079
yeah that's one reason why is why it is

248
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:08,199
only enabled in master we have some time

249
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:11,500
Freya frame until the four point five

250
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,990
point four release to hopefully find

251
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:18,009
those corner cases databases I don't

252
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:19,420
really know what it contains but it

253
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,980
doesn't contain your base databases

254
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,560
because you save them somewhere wherever

255
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,019
you want they are not by default saved

256
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:30,060
in the user profile as far as I know

257
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:57,779
no danger position across just a second

258
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:06,889
I determine what happens in case of the

259
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:26,690
okay my time is over yeah so normally

260
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,310
when you edit the documents and you make

261
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,290
a mistake you have an undo button and it

262
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,710
has a nice label saying what the changes

263
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:36,530
that you would like to reverse the

264
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,660
dialog she just shows for an average

265
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,510
user I think look very scary and if it

266
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,730
just had a label undo to remove all of

267
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,670
the icons I think there would be more

268
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,190
user friendly I mean in a user is quite

269
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,140
panicky in a situation like this or

270
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,660
anything has to go to safe mode so any

271
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,310
type of scary dialog right discomfort is

272
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,580
comfortable

273
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,310
do you think it's feasible to have nice

274
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,710
labels like with undo for what you are

275
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:08,740
going to be set yeah one could list the

276
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,310
configuration options

277
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:15,920
they usually have labels yeah it won't

278
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,859
be so nice like undo but maybe there is

279
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:21,458
some room for improvement

280
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:29,190
yeah good idea okay thank you

281
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:35,430
[Applause]
