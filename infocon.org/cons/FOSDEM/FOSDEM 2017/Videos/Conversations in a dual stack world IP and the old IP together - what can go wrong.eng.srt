1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
but all the background

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:11,469
material into their heads Oh two day

3
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:14,309
three hours or two two minutes

4
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:16,720
this is going to be a problem to cover

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,289
this area in 20 minutes without you

6
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:22,119
having all the background but I'll do my

7
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:23,369
best

8
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:29,890
ipv6 simple beautiful if you connect to

9
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:34,470
the foster Network you run ipv6 only

10
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:39,730
you're happy things work mostly but more

11
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,600
things work this year than last year but

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,180
this is fairly simple if you move your

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,090
stuff and you portlet ipv6 both server

14
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,609
and client things will just work it's

15
00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:55,750
just more bits on the IP packets dienes

16
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:00,129
TCP UDP everything works like before no

17
00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:04,120
problems this was the world we saw in

18
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,170
the mid-90s when we said that well ipv4

19
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,540
is dying so fast it's going to be gone

20
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:19,050
before year 2000 no at least it's gone

21
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,270
so I'm not gonna spend much time on this

22
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:26,130
you all know ipv6 right you all use ipv6

23
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:32,560
networks right cool this is where we get

24
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,170
into trouble we have two stacks we have

25
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,620
the old legacy dying creepy scary

26
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:42,250
insecure ipv4 Network and we have the

27
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,920
ipv6 Network and we end up in situations

28
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,100
where the client wants to connect to a

29
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,560
server and suddenly have the choice of

30
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,860
two different paths they're two

31
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,310
different protocols bringing us from

32
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:03,160
point A to point B this is like putting

33
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,230
my wife behind the wheel and trying to

34
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,970
explain you can go this way and that way

35
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,340
and she's gonna look like what

36
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,190
and then I'm not saying go that way we

37
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:16,299
did that in dorsey's we said go ipv6 if

38
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:18,270
you have ipv6 ipv4

39
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:23,960
go ipv6 this turned into a problem

40
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,220
Microsoft have done a lot of good things

41
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,780
with ipv6 they actually in a Windows

42
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,380
released enable ipv6 for every single

43
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,680
computer through automatic tunnels so

44
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,900
your Windows desktop believed it had

45
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,280
ipv6 firewall blocked it sites that

46
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,580
actually published ipv6 DNS records for

47
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,740
the same hostname got into trouble

48
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,440
because the browser said Google's not

49
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,800
reachable Facebook not reachable which

50
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,230
wasn't very good for marketing didn't

51
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,030
help the brands when everyone thought

52
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,240
the server's was down so they

53
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,360
immediately disabled ipv6 which is not

54
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,200
what we wanted the solution to all of

55
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,040
this is happy eyeballs in the idea we

56
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,350
created a standard specification saying

57
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,710
you should not start with ipv6 and then

58
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:23,730
when you fail move to ipv4 you should

59
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:28,560
connect to both ipv6 could give give it

60
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,160
a few milliseconds Head Start right but

61
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,590
connect to both mostly at the same time

62
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,830
and the first that response you keep

63
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,840
that connection close to other one and

64
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,180
you'll be happy the users will be happy

65
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,610
the marketing people will happy and we

66
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,900
can safely migrate to ipv6 so the

67
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,270
browser vendors they implemented all

68
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:55,220
this on June 6 a few years ago we tested

69
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,250
live on the Internet

70
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,560
Facebook Microsoft Google everyone

71
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,820
turned on ipv6 on the same host names

72
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:09,750
and nothing happened all browsing

73
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,030
succeeded everyone was happy in their

74
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,030
eyes marketing people was happy and we

75
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:19,769
had ipv6 back in DNS happy eyeballs

76
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:23,490
connecting at the same time not doing it

77
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:28,110
serially and continuing on the session

78
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,680
that opened first

79
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:37,430
that's great well on mobile phones I

80
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,280
frequently see that we have multiple

81
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,770
interfaces so now we have ipv4 and

82
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,430
possibly ipv6 on the mobile cellphone

83
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,350
Network and then we have Wi-Fi

84
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:57,130
who should we set up for connections 10

85
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,880
where's the limit

86
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,400
I have devices with 4 SIM cards and

87
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,289
Wi-Fi so the new world is giving us

88
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:10,490
problems and what happens what we see is

89
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,410
that the mobile networks that I add ipv6

90
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:18,680
the ipv4 network it's suddenly behind on

91
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,360
that carrier grade professional high end

92
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,150
cool not not that small and family home

93
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,030
router stuff you have at home this is a

94
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,539
professional carrier grade not which

95
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:41,300
makes it no better right real

96
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,000
time protocols are not doesn't love each

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,070
other that's not it

98
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,039
they have session management on their

99
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,500
network they're adding a lot of boxes to

100
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,530
manage stuff to make your experience

101
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:58,460
better which practically kills

102
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,320
everything you want to do real time

103
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,630
because to make things better the

104
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,650
closed-down IP flows to get room for new

105
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,949
IP flowers to make new users happy so

106
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:11,840
your concurrent session in the

107
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,530
background to your ex and people server

108
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:21,560
go your WebSocket trash burn no fun at

109
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,070
all so we see that ipv4 network is

110
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,909
quickly dying we have cell phones in

111
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:31,220
production years in the National Public

112
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,139
Radio where I spend a lot of time these

113
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:36,289
days we're moving heavily towards ipv6

114
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:39,650
which gives us a very clear path for the

115
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:44,390
live broadcast audio directly from

116
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:49,720
otherwise to our studio the ipv4 network

117
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,620
everyone complains we see with these

118
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,020
mobile apps is that networks come and go

119
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,760
suddenly the network you're using and

120
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,600
you're having so much fun with Wow

121
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,710
disappears yet showed up I was really

122
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:15,290
bad going back this is making life

123
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:19,370
really really hard to live real time

124
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:23,600
connections bi-directional so happy

125
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,690
eyeballs well that's a start but we

126
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,110
really need to focus on this in sip we

127
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,290
need to have session resumption like the

128
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,570
previous speaker talked about with XMPP

129
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:38,750
we need to be able to move our sessions

130
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,670
but in multimedia

131
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,120
that's called eyes there's some cool

132
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,290
stuff in eyes sol mention it but of

133
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:53,480
course the internet is sleeving IP we're

134
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,710
moving everything on top of HTTP right

135
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,150
and this all the problem will happen

136
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,800
i've also everything is good and dandy

137
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,300
and we're getting the new versions

138
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,090
everything is sexy one protocol for us

139
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:07,820
all for those of you who doesn't believe

140
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:13,719
that religion we still have good old set

141
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:19,220
right so the browser vendors sold this

142
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:24,320
years ago the offenders sold this moving

143
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,480
to next slide

144
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,410
XMPP while tcp-based have the same

145
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,080
problems as HTTP haven't seen any

146
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,210
discussion about solo days I hope they

147
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:39,440
cleaned up their illness Oh WebRTC in

148
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,380
the core specs s we're dual stack

149
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,209
right how many have tested that and in

150
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:51,980
some specs I asked

151
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,550
Oh what about ipv6 or dual stack we'll

152
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:02,480
take that later okay when are see 32 61

153
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,959
which is 140 pages of fun stated early

154
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:14,120
sick works with both ipv4 and ipv6 so we

155
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,940
should be good right I mean come on this

156
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:22,370
was in 2002 tell me your supports ipv6

157
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:26,330
from day one in our code staying happy

158
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:31,330
do we have a problem in set I tested it

159
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:35,080
ship it I've been testing numerous times

160
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,930
we have issues with finding the best

161
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,680
media path but there are standards

162
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,529
setting up a connection to signaling try

163
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:49,430
hype eyeballs over UDP fellows give me a

164
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,740
solution to that finding the quickest

165
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,940
connection where we have a

166
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:59,600
connectionless protocol setting up the

167
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,040
best connection between users so this is

168
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,700
rather fun I ended up with this

169
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,990
conclusion yeah we do have a problem

170
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:14,709
someone is going to fix it

171
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,040
oops someone is me hey join me in fixing

172
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,020
this oops guess not so started writing

173
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:29,120
some ITF documents I got actually a few

174
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,700
people on board helping me write those

175
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,320
and getting it through the whole process

176
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,230
so we have one or C now and we have two

177
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,720
more drafts coming on how to fix this in

178
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,470
sit what we discovered while testing was

179
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:46,610
that ipv4 devices with single stacks

180
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,520
crashed and burned because in sip the

181
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,800
iPad races everywhere in the messages

182
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,830
and we injected ipv6 addresses here

183
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:58,730
they're their software burn so even if

184
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,780
you're not porting your software to ipv6

185
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,100
you need to watch out when you have

186
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,720
these protocols because we're sending

187
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,790
addresses inside also when I said in my

188
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:15,590
dns that hey I prefer if you connect to

189
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,710
me over ipv6 in my yessiree records the

190
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:22,000
first priority was ipv6 only the second

191
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,900
was ipv4 and ipv6 many implementations

192
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,300
crashed and burned because they couldn't

193
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,460
real understand that first priority and

194
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,990
didn't understand that they should fail

195
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,000
over to the second priority and that's

196
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,130
covered in the RC you're all going home

197
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:42,800
to read that I actually wrote so crashes

198
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:51,940
no connections that's fun yeah for media

199
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:56,540
we have eyes and eyes have ipv6 editions

200
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,300
you have dual stacks and the default

201
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,570
role is if you are P v6 only you have to

202
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:05,810
help those poor poor poor pieces of code

203
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:08,660
out there that doesn't support this by

204
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,970
going to a turn server and applying for

205
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,540
one of these ipv4 legacy addresses so

206
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,880
you have to help others have I seen this

207
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,680
in WebRTC no the biggest problem I had

208
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,740
was in one of the core RFC's there was a

209
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,990
little or so people came to me and said

210
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,010
well Dorothy says

211
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,370
I should ask for ipv4 or ipv6 and ask

212
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:37,860
for one five years of fighting the war

213
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,850
changing that on and but we did it we we

214
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:47,370
change that or C so where are we sit one

215
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,960
or C published one sip forum document

216
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,670
ITF drafting process we're making

217
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:57,210
progress in progress XMPP I have the

218
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,400
same happy eyeballs problems I haven't

219
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,190
seen any don't need and the or sees but

220
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,050
the implementations need to test and

221
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:08,700
seeing that web RTC should work sounds

222
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:16,860
promising right yeah we have work to do

223
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,410
and I believe there are many many other

224
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,930
protocols out there that have this

225
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,870
problem but people haven't really tested

226
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,080
haven't considered the impact of dual

227
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,290
stack fully I think in sip we're

228
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:35,060
actually way ahead of a lot of protocols

229
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:38,610
so you may ask yourself is this for real

230
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:42,810
yes many mobile carriers around the

231
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,450
globe started in the US but actually now

232
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,250
in Sweden as well or carrier in the

233
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:51,090
radio added ipv6 we have dual stacks and

234
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,950
all our office mobile phones

235
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:56,910
so everything journalist out there dual

236
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:00,840
stack so that's cool

237
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,080
at the same time they actually added a

238
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,890
carry granite and every week they keep

239
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,640
modifying the session timers without not

240
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,020
which is fun because then I have to

241
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,090
modify to keep allies in my camellia

242
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:21,150
server which keeps me busy so they're

243
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,940
adjusting their stuff they don't want to

244
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,540
occupy as more people get on board with

245
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,820
this dual stack server the carrier guard

246
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,890
not allocates memory for all the

247
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,990
sessions and they don't want to keep

248
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,510
them in memory so they went down from

249
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,730
five minutes to three minutes and now

250
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,139
recently to one minute

251
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:43,449
and they also have a session limitation

252
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,920
we haven't found that and they don't

253
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,660
want to tell us but they are confirmed

254
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,119
they have an limitation on the number of

255
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:52,149
concurrent ipv4 sessions and they're

256
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:57,459
properly adjusting that as well so this

257
00:14:57,459 --> 00:14:58,179
is fun

258
00:14:58,179 --> 00:15:01,059
we discover that we have those little

259
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:04,679
access points connecting to cell data

260
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:07,569
they still run that even though the

261
00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:11,319
network runs not so in those cases if we

262
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:14,009
use ipv4 we have dual knots

263
00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:16,420
what can be better than a single net

264
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:16,869
yeah

265
00:15:16,869 --> 00:15:19,119
two knots in the same session we're

266
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:23,410
happy that little mobile packed bad way

267
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,389
had a sip helper application an

268
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:27,369
application level gateway that in yeah

269
00:15:27,369 --> 00:15:32,019
key so loves so removing everything all

270
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:34,990
the media try preview six as fast as we

271
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:37,869
can so we're really pushing our vendors

272
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:41,230
and that's the tough problem they are

273
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,550
not ready for this

274
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,980
Oh we tested ipv6 in our lab and it

275
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,699
works ok have you tested this this this

276
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:51,879
oh I wasn't aware of that thanks God I

277
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:56,199
can push 2.2 ITF documents and real

278
00:15:56,199 --> 00:16:00,129
stuff in the sip forum not just being me

279
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:04,420
even though I wrote them you have issues

280
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,790
with this asterisk as he issues free

281
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,829
switch most like to have no solders and

282
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:11,410
the same thing I think goes for a lot of

283
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:14,230
these we need to solve the happy

284
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,029
eyeballs problems and I need you guys to

285
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:18,279
help me would you DP because that's the

286
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:22,779
missing draft you're drafted right it's

287
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:24,610
getting painful because this is in

288
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:29,139
production it's now really it exists in

289
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:30,999
a lot of products we have a lot of

290
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:34,089
theories move to TCP and you can do hep

291
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:37,389
eyeballs fix their eye stuff and you're

292
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:39,660
ready

293
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,230
you also need to look because a lot of

294
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,730
your applications even though they're

295
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,490
zip web versus X and P P they use HTTP

296
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,490
or LDAP or something else

297
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:51,680
all of these TCP connection protocols

298
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,829
there will have happy eyeballs problems

299
00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:58,130
as soon as you add ipv6 to the DNS entry

300
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:59,000
so this is your application soon to be

301
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,190
honest I haven't started testing that

302
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,200
because I've been so fully occupied with

303
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,730
this we said that the last Zipit where

304
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:11,510
pages APIs actually mold we say that we

305
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:15,370
need to install not 64 inert

306
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:21,880
but this has been so painful it's been

307
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,149
enough but you're right we probably need

308
00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:27,309
to look into that as well especially

309
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:29,919
with the NSA and other things not 64 can

310
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:41,409
be interesting more questions you're

311
00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:42,820
happy you're going to read all the

312
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,809
documentation the AI downloaded you're

313
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:49,360
happy eyeballs stay in this room and the

314
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,679
rest of the documentation will be

315
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:53,740
downloaded at five o'clock or something

316
00:18:53,740 --> 00:19:32,770
into your extra memory thank you and the

317
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:36,929
same problems that we have with media

318
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,690
since you're lucky enough to have TCP I

319
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,960
mean then you can used to do to have

320
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,570
eyeballs and I'm fortunate enough to
