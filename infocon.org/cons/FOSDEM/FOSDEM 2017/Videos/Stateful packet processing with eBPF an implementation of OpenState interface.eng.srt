is

2015

12
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:37,040
it's expected to close to the base to

13
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,349
get more speed relative control and

14
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:42,129
precision tests inside the switches

15
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:45,600
we're keeping this centralized control

2:22 is placed in secret

29
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,280
so to integrate the sequence for example

30
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,780
in my case packets on UDP but we're

31
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:43,469
number one - two - two from the sequence

32
00:05:47,010 --> 00:06:00,120
starts in the initial stage here - three

33
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,450
and if we

which is the project Christians

41
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,800
for Martha my pet yes can we do this

42
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,700
with a BF

43
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:29,509
to see hooks to attach program so we can

44
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:35,529
I can compare man from

45
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:41,000
and I can a serpentine to the usual

46
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:53,240
programs because many trans processes

47
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,580
pack up and then once it's finished with

48
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,440
everything about it state its to

49
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,120
describe it and then when the next after

50
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,990
a while you start

to perform action you can attach it to

61
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,880
the only thing you have to do after that

62
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,010
is to initialize elapsed we have not

63
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:16,010
provided the caduceus states we can use

64
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:20,350
a program that 2000 DPF system phase 2

traffic I can forget this packet from

slept in that

84
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,490
a lot of packets to the last period

85
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,589
because we're blood shifted during the

86
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:40,980
match slides okay we can for other Souls

87
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,420
about it and the position of the window

88
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,519
choose the current position of the

00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:04,230
based on the current state conditions

[Music]

111
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:13,340
registers into tables a spreadsheet for

00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:20,350
the application packets from the client

113
00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:25,010
first six packets to communicate about

114
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:28,960
have a capacity of five tokens

115
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:47,870
first let's them we have to each the

116
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:55,479
first project

117
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,839

00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,070
[Music]

119
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:57,290
I want to completes difficult to do

120
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,130

[Music]

126
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:21,190
you can go and see them if you have

127
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,730
questions

128
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,969
[Music]

129
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:37,419
so what's the real performance depends

130
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:41,640
on that implementation you and 32f

131
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:45,250
[Music]

132
00:21:56,789 --> 00:22:16,570
there's a simple deprivation because we

133
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:24,570
use maps we use hash map to revenues

134
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,139
[Music]

135
00:22:26,139 --> 00:22:28,059
I think we can get pretty good

136
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:31,450
performances of that depends first my

137
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,519
steps and I stopped include trying this

138
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:37,899
with X DP X so as to to tell better

139
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:45,120
performances question

140
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,279
okay
