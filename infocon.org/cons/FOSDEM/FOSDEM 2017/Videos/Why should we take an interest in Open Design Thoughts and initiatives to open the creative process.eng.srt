1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,670
bloopers but in the artistic field for

2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,219
me it's really really unusual so I think

3
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:12,260
it was really a nice approach to open

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:16,119
your open approaches a graphic designer

5
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:19,160
so after the UI design I wish here to

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,169
talk about typography and I would like

7
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:23,449
to talk about velvet time when it

8
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:26,300
impacts injury and OSPF Andre and I like

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,169
that work and I use the font families I

10
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:32,150
will give you a few examples of

11
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,480
whichever means P so there are two small

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,219
foundries you can download the phones

13
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:40,219
you can use them and there's some

14
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:43,879
full-time repo you type repositories so

15
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:45,469
you can download the phones you can

16
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:47,600
create your own version and distribute

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,510
your own versions and in this case I'm

18
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:52,429
advised you to look at the readme file

19
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:56,089
because they're different licensing open

20
00:00:56,089 --> 00:01:01,609
source open source so in our work we

21
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:04,280
have to choose font families for

22
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,900
websites on for apps and what can we

23
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,590
choose so we can pay a fault

24
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,110
alessondra and thus we would pay the

25
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,240
work of typographers and there are

26
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,909
really really beautiful typefaces and

27
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:24,079
then you also have free fonts so now

28
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,110
purple drawn over less properly drawn

29
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:32,060
and in this free form the open source

30
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,020
fonts here I'm giving you two examples

31
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,560
from Velveteen type foundries and first

32
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,450
you see the fan Gardo which is you saw

33
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,030
the LED website this is the presidential

34
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,240
services website and here you have the

35
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,090
ELMO which is used for a theatre olicity

36
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:55,729
of video so why is it interesting to use

37
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:58,399
open source fonts here I would say that

38
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,890
first you have a quality of the drum

39
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:04,130
tech fishes because of the mastery and

40
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,570
because of the experience there really

41
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:12,739
for me remarkable typefaces and then for

42
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:14,599
example here and there are also

43
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:17,860
typographers web designers artists

44
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,580
and who have an exponential approach and

45
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,640
who really pushed the limits and

46
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,200
question their tools that question that

47
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,350
practice inflexible here for open source

48
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:33,280
publishing the typefaces have really

49
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,210
particular particular clearance and it

50
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,310
was really specific atmosphere for your

51
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:44,560
website for example and I think when we

52
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,740
use Apple opening open phones we also

53
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,880
fight against uniformity because mostly

54
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,580
we use Roboto we use open source all we

55
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,910
so use social Pro and I hear from me

56
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,250
it's really refreshing to to see new

57
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:07,360
typefaces and an expected design I would

58
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,209
like some of the words about what it

59
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:13,870
also brings us to use up on phones in

60
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,690
this case for example if you choose

61
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,950
whichever OSP phones

62
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,730
it's from it's a really strong artist

63
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:26,620
choice from you because you also support

64
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,730
their open approach and you can create

65
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,550
the older shows and destroyed it so you

66
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,130
become an actor and actress of them

67
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:40,060
opens of feel and it's really great for

68
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,510
me to you to to jump in this in this

69
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:52,150
field and also as associations as public

70
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,880
organization or as freelance designer if

71
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,610
you don't have any budget to buy a

72
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,380
typeface I think it's really good

73
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,140
alternative for you look at this front

74
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,940
and see if there's something that you

75
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:10,900
can that you can use so what else about

76
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,380
these two foundries vtf in OSP which is

77
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,728
a Brussels this organization the the

78
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:19,750
prior to give a talker

79
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,329
HT mate to print this year but

80
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:24,940
unfortunately they won't give it so they

81
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,640
also give workshops so here you have the

82
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,180
phone fog fog workshops and

83
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,669
invited to to create own versions of the

84
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:35,820
cooper-hewitt during two days they

85
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,300
accompany you to create own versions and

86
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,030
on Sunday evening everyone shows its

87
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,780
result here you have a few examples so

88
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,750
if you have if you have a type less

89
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,660
drawing basis I do recommend you to

90
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,330
follow in in Brussels OSP workshops and

91
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,840
which a bit small in France and Paris

92
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,400
otherwise just go there discuss with

93
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,350
them look at the results and that's what

94
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:05,910
I did two years ago to finish with part

95
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,099
I would like to say a few words about

96
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:14,220
originality and copy so these are the

97
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,009
leaders of copywriting and copyleft and

98
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:23,280
maybe India Jones designers might think

99
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,800
I won't share my design I won't show my

100
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,220
work because it's my original work and I

101
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,440
wouldn't have said I do understood but

102
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,470
you could open selection of your

103
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,960
projects because if you share new

104
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,840
techniques the designers who will use it

105
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,340
will create something completely

106
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,580
different and developers are used to

107
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,240
help each other they're the giver

108
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,349
technical health which is only a

109
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,080
starting point and when you share your

110
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,780
techniques you you allow creativity and

111
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,780
you allow everyone to progress so

112
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:00,060
something we really add skills knowledge

113
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,699
and intelligence and I think it's really

114
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:06,050
for designers it can only be the

115
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,340
enriching for us and when you really

116
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,870
read that you have helped inspire

117
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,479
someone I think it's really rewarding so

118
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,940
we show how a designer's shadow work now

119
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,190
we will see how an organization can

120
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,130
share the creative process and I wish to

121
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:27,270
talk about multi-level printing my goal

122
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,150
here is not to give my opinion about the

123
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,509
the girls what I want to point air here

124
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:36,990
is how designers can commit in this open

125
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:41,990
process so in this case how do we

126
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,210
sure design process how what are the

127
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,070
raised questions and how to think

128
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:52,580
further do 2016 missile launch an open

129
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,680
conversation and maybe you read things

130
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,560
about it from the new logo and the new

131
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,430
identity during the one of the biannual

132
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,860
meeting internal meeting this was in

133
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,030
London so I think here you can see the

134
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,220
the process was open trade release was

135
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:14,390
more than 1200 people everyone can read

136
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,280
the process and you also can give

137
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,320
feedback so for me it was a first

138
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,950
remarkable point then we can further

139
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,260
creative processes and process on their

140
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,460
blog and the third point it has the open

141
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,250
the the similar suggestion to the

142
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,050
comments so here you are the first seven

143
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:40,040
concepts I read lots of comments from

144
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,800
all over the world people saying I like

145
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,570
this one because it's what moduli

146
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,400
represents for me and I don't like this

147
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,300
one because what I wish to remain here

148
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,060
is that the comments are based on the

149
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,390
knowledge the experience and the culture

150
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:00,320
of everyone and it's not so easy to

151
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,760
judge a logo because in this case first

152
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,740
it will be used for years and in this

153
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,320
case it's for a big and important

154
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,950
organization and brand and just you to

155
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,450
compare it something else I will give

156
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,980
you an and comparison in the

157
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,430
architecture field which you ask the

158
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,560
audience to choose a building in the

159
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,950
architecture contest only which criteria

160
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,110
will the public be able to the church

161
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,870
and to decide if this building of this

162
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,240
building will be acceptable because in

163
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,000
architecture and studies and studied

164
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,230
resistance the materials during

165
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,000
techniques you have art history

166
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,870
art architecture history and you design

167
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,360
projects and these points make that you

168
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,160
are a little bit more capable than

169
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,370
something else to judge a building and

170
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,090
to me it's the same graphic design

171
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,940
whatever feel it is you have your quite

172
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,850
technique and artistic basis to judge to

173
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,190
assess the field and what you are

174
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:06,850
looking looking at so you come back at

175
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:11,320
these several concepts I'd like to give

176
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,090
some tips for men designers to look at

177
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,100
them so for example when you have this

178
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,130
the question you can you can have you

179
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:22,030
can you can have this does it work in

180
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,430
high scale for toppling for example that

181
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,040
does it work in small scales does it

182
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,750
work in curls and does it work in

183
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,750
backing right what are all the moons

184
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:36,340
each of them conveys which is the well

185
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,710
done in each of them are the tensions

186
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,380
between the between the LT and the

187
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:47,320
filled parts also how is it integrated

188
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,440
in the graphic history does it add

189
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,990
something new is it to come on is it too

190
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:53,830
ordinary

191
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,440
and does it respond to your client

192
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,010
requests because here you have modular

193
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:03,220
but you also have its users users in all

194
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,750
over the world and volunteers in all

195
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,400
over the world so for me in this case

196
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,070
it's really really difficult to create

197
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:11,530
and to judge and to judge on these

198
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:16,590
suggestions so

199
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:20,640
this year's case will first my feeling

200
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,810
that you do need a toolbox to truly look

201
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,170
at them we designers to share our

202
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,440
knowledge and so the way I see how

203
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,780
designers can commit in this in this

204
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:38,590
case is that share with your family with

205
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,450
your colleagues with your friend your

206
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,680
knowledge how do you look at this logos

207
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,600
which are the qualities and weaknesses

208
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,630
of each of them and which one is

209
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,820
acceptable and which one is not and

210
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,220
that's that's what I wanted to to point

211
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,510
out here so talking about a tooth

212
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:01,630
toolbox I will here gives you tips to

213
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,450
share them practice with your team your

214
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,640
designers usually just to say I

215
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,290
understand

216
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,720
the outcome is different from my design

217
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,350
and then we asked for the reason why the

218
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,759
answer is up I'm sorry

219
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,979
the answer is yes what works good enough

220
00:11:17,979 --> 00:11:22,839
I would say no design is not about good

221
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:25,779
enough because designers don't put in an

222
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:28,509
hit ELISA way graphic elements we don't

223
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:31,119
throw in the air and announce that would

224
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:33,069
just drop on a page and create a random

225
00:11:33,069 --> 00:11:38,109
composition familiar design is to answer

226
00:11:38,109 --> 00:11:41,499
to particular proposed by offering ICT

227
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:46,419
basis I'm sorry an ICT tail is an icy

228
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:49,139
quality and based on research and

229
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:52,209
reflection and that's why our design is

230
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:56,109
strong and justified and so why do some

231
00:11:56,109 --> 00:11:59,259
developers feel free to to modify our

232
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:03,339
design here I would like to point out

233
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:05,709
one reason and for me I think there

234
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:07,569
might be a lack of understanding of what

235
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:13,799
design is and what it brings so for me

236
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:18,730
when designers do the design it's based

237
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,739
on what they have known of the

238
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:23,499
researchers and their practice and I

239
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:25,929
would like to go back to the etymology

240
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:28,419
of the word design so it comes from the

241
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:30,369
latin word the Signum the mark design

242
00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:34,419
and unfortunately in French in the 18th

243
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:34,929
century

244
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:37,419
we lost the disco the the purpose the ID

245
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:39,999
part and we only kept the death on the

246
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:42,819
drawing pad so unfortunately less it in

247
00:12:42,819 --> 00:12:46,059
French but in English we really have the

248
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:49,319
ID and the drawing proposal e drawing

249
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:55,359
and that's why when you give a designer

250
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:59,289
melt decision and based on theory and I

251
00:12:59,289 --> 00:13:01,329
stick sense that we do develop doing a

252
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:07,059
stories and during approaches so for me

253
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:09,939
we have to complement each other to

254
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:14,249
create the best project that we can and

255
00:13:14,249 --> 00:13:17,409
here I I will give you some tips to

256
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:18,819
share your designer

257
00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:20,439
during practice with your team because

258
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:21,880
we don't have time

259
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,470
to talk about design principles and core

260
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:28,270
principles example so I would say that

261
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,430
before showing any mock-up and design

262
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,040
you should introduce your graphic and

263
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,140
artistic choices so you give context to

264
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,040
your stakeholders to get on board then

265
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,580
if in the discussion we are told okay

266
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,350
I don't like it let a bigger like a

267
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:47,320
driller and create it here use the

268
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,530
question why then you force your

269
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,510
interlocutors to give there to present

270
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:56,080
the arguments and then you can explain

271
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,350
to them that the concerns are not really

272
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:02,230
justified on the last point I would give

273
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,900
here is Bill Malloy's Sam's your mock-up

274
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,570
and your design to do more so everyone

275
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,550
can access it you will trigger

276
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,910
discussion and thoughts but you will

277
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:18,810
have Colonel steps and goals and also

278
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,820
you avoid too much to discover the

279
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,710
design only well it's online because

280
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:28,930
it's very hurtful for me so nearly the

281
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:31,000
end I'll give you some links and

282
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,580
references so if you wish to have a look

283
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,670
at the Ricardo Vasquez videos you just

284
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,110
search for the RF design YouTube you

285
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,330
have Velveteen type from tree or SP from

286
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:43,180
dream I don't have time but if you wish

287
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,730
to to learn to read something about

288
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,640
opportunity and copy I bless you this

289
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,230
book from Waterbury I mean you have the

290
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,110
blogspot from Mozilla and if you wish

291
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,780
you have also the ditch type theory so

292
00:14:55,780 --> 00:15:00,820
you can have some informations here so I

293
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,860
hope it was helpful as an introduction

294
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,810
to pencil even if you may be mostly

295
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:08,200
designers here I hope that you have some

296
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,660
tips and some tools and full of thoughts

297
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,960
you to go further and maybe change the

298
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,030
way we design the way we collaborate the

299
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,550
way we were together and the way we

300
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,390
would cook it the design process thank

301
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,540
you

302
00:15:27,850 --> 00:16:17,450
okay I also assumed I'm sorry so let me

303
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,910
feel the cushion is about visibility

304
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:24,520
logo if we work together on the project

305
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:32,720
yes yes together this is a personal

306
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,580
point of view for you when you could go

307
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:38,050
we could do more than she is represent

308
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:41,330
it's really difficult because we can't

309
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,880
record I believe that we can work

310
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,320
together really properly because when I

311
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,190
worked as a graphic designers to work

312
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,590
together you have to share colors and

313
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,180
come on

314
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,690
I decided manage skill and artistic bear

315
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,360
bases so first if you work with someone

316
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,520
that don't share the story is really

317
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,250
hard and the case will see that it works

318
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,560
when the people is really a kind of have

319
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,230
you seen English some views we really

320
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,970
can work together we talk together we

321
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,650
understand each other just by drawing

322
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,589
for example and for me personally I

323
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:22,970
don't believe logos written by I don't

324
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,520
know 20 people it's personal but we can

325
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,230
discuss more about it will be some other

326
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:35,420
here only only logos for me the

327
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,909
collaborative process when

328
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:41,789
many people it's I think we'd harm we ha

329
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:44,159
you really have to understand sugar and

330
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:47,399
you have to make compromises so long

331
00:17:47,399 --> 00:18:21,409
we'll tell people we have two more

332
00:18:21,409 --> 00:18:24,059
perfecting and more critical the way we

333
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:26,129
talk about others because I feel

334
00:18:26,129 --> 00:18:28,470
sometimes we fall into this trap as well

335
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,570
like we say I really like this work and

336
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,090
then we stop we don't say why you like

337
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,460
it and then say I can explain like this

338
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,629
is the concept so kind of in order to

339
00:18:38,629 --> 00:18:41,279
make this better we have to talk to

340
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,989
people about it like we would talk about

341
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:50,970
the design yes so the question is as

342
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,249
designers we have also have a critical

343
00:18:53,249 --> 00:18:56,999
attitude and to question the beyond our

344
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:59,100
girls are designing cetera and yes I

345
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,809
agree to the reviews because if we only

346
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,789
give their designs and we stop here

347
00:19:05,789 --> 00:19:07,350
without explaining why we made this

348
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,779
choices etc in fact it would keep

349
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:12,570
unleash for us and that's why I took

350
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,210
about the toolbox and the tits if we

351
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:19,039
share our skills and imagine our choices

352
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,960
first we make evil as understand it and

353
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,639
F example for me if decision-makers had

354
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:29,730
a better visual culture we wouldn't

355
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,129
suffer such low quality interfaces for

356
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:35,450
example for example and so also between

357
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,730
between different work fields if we

358
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,440
share our knowledge with developers

359
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,239
we've I don't know marketing team etc

360
00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:43,859
and if we explain that

361
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:47,159
ok maybe if I was great but now let me

362
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:48,190
explain why

363
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:52,799
this and because of design principles

364
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,179
compressing principle theory of colors

365
00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:58,299
etc and I think that as designers we we

366
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:01,240
should open up practice and spend what

367
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,769
we did and why did we did it because

368
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:05,769
it's kind of we just share knowledge and

369
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:08,169
wish our culture is really important for

370
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:10,350
me it's really I believe in education

371
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:14,139
and if you keep just for designers we'll

372
00:20:14,139 --> 00:20:17,230
have a lack of understanding between the

373
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:20,889
public but also with other other people

374
00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:22,960
in your team and with stakeholders so I

375
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,450
couldn't agree with you we we also have

376
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:31,200
to have critical attitude without work

377
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:40,489
