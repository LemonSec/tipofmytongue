1
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,319
I'm Kevin Fleming I work for Bloomberg

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,269
in New York City and also in London and

3
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:11,090
wherever else they send me so I was

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,589
gonna ask them the questions Karen just

5
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:14,179
asked so first of all how many people

6
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:15,980
here do not know what a corporate

7
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,140
contributor License Agreement is don't

8
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,939
be shy raise your hand if you don't know

9
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:21,470
would you like okay there's enough I

10
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,260
could tell you so there are some open

11
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,060
source projects that when you want to

12
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,949
contribute to them in addition to

13
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:29,750
whatever open source license the code is

14
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,609
distributed under which of course your

15
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:34,190
code is a derivative of also we require

16
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,050
you to sign an additional agreement

17
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,870
which could be for a variety of reasons

18
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,129
we're not going to go into the many

19
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:42,049
reasons why those exists because that

20
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:43,549
would be a day long discussion on its

21
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:46,309
own but this talk is about the

22
00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:48,949
practicalities of being a large company

23
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:50,780
which I work for a large company and

24
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,059
wanting our developers to be able to

25
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:54,619
contribute to those projects and having

26
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:56,299
to deal with the mechanics of doing this

27
00:00:56,299 --> 00:00:59,360
that sort of thing you've probably all

28
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,460
experienced if you've ever contributed

29
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,350
to an open-source project the wide

30
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,269
varieties of ways they accept patches

31
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:06,950
and then the way they do code reviews

32
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,570
and the way they discuss code and all

33
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,700
those kinds of things and you would

34
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,979
prefer of course a simple easy to

35
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:15,170
navigate process what I'm going to talk

36
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,789
about here is I would prefer an it's

37
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:18,530
simple easy to navigate process when one

38
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,359
of our developers wants to contribute to

39
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:24,350
one of these projects so I'll make sure

40
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,759
I try to get these slides in a

41
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,310
reasonable place so I have new

42
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,499
contributing to open source software for

43
00:01:30,499 --> 00:01:32,869
a very long time whilst not say how long

44
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:34,310
because you know how old I was

45
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,920
I have run projects I've actually been

46
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,840
on both sides of this equations I used

47
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,579
to run a project that used a contributor

48
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:41,990
License Agreement in which it still does

49
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,909
now I'm on the other side I work for a

50
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:46,009
company that produces open-source

51
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:47,840
software as a small part of what we do

52
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,579
our primary business is commercial

53
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:52,130
software and data services but we use

54
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,229
open source software heavily and so we

55
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:55,700
end up of course contributing to those

56
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,229
projects so the ubiquitous slide for

57
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:02,329
this room I'm not a lawyer not your

58
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:05,030
lawyer don't play a lawyer on TV if you

59
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,979
take any of this as legal advice you're

60
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:09,740
entirely on your own so and

61
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,590
unfortunately because I couldn't use the

62
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,210
the slides in my original form I didn't

63
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,280
get to have these lines show up as I

64
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,690
press the button so you get to see the

65
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:17,970
answer

66
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,500
to the questions before I get to ask

67
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,570
them this was gonna be the question the

68
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,160
softball question for Richard to answer

69
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,240
because he's the one who would have

70
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,750
answered this so as you might imagine

71
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,980
when someone comes to us and wants to

72
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,590
contribute to an open-source project the

73
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,720
simplest option is when that project

74
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,700
doesn't require any contributor License

75
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,780
Agreement at all

76
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,730
we can just go look at what open-source

77
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,770
license is distributed under look for

78
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,930
any other interesting potential caveats

79
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,040
that might be associated with that

80
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,500
project and then say go ahead you're all

81
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,520
set there are some projects who don't

82
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,110
want to go to the extent of having a

83
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,340
contributor License Agreement

84
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,410
which is great but they still want each

85
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,390
contribution that comes to the project

86
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,940
to have some explicit acknowledgment of

87
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,430
the fact that yes I do intend to give

88
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,190
this to the project and so some time ago

89
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,450
I don't remember how many years now I'm

90
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,680
sure someone in the room can tell me

91
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,660
this thing called a developer

92
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,030
certificate of origin was created which

93
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,550
is a very straightforward attempt to

94
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,390
solve that problem

95
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,060
it basically requires basically is a

96
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,040
very small process that the developer

97
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,890
can use to say yes I am giving this

98
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,050
contribution to the project and I

99
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,120
certify that it's either my work or that

100
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,380
I have permission to give it to you

101
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,970
under the terms of the license that the

102
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,580
project uses it would be wonderful

103
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,700
in ideal fantasy world if that was the

104
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,530
end of this if we did not have to do

105
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,440
individual contractual agreements to

106
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,690
contribute to some projects

107
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,530
unfortunately many projects have been

108
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,300
told by their attorneys or others that

109
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,310
they do need to have them so we have to

110
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,350
deal with this

111
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:51,870
so this is unfortunate because I would

112
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,970
have had there you've been able to go

113
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,209
through this much more easily but in our

114
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:58,920
company and which is probably true in

115
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,049
many large companies there are going to

116
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:04,110
be at least four people involved when an

117
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,000
employee wants to begin contributing

118
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,100
work that they've done at the company so

119
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,750
it's property that belongs to the

120
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,220
company not something they did on their

121
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,900
own spare time or on their own computer

122
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,820
or whatever they want to contribute that

123
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,519
to an open source project and that open

124
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,858
source project requires a contributor

125
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,510
contributor license agreement to be

126
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,250
signed obviously you've got the

127
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,900
developer that wrote the code in the

128
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,510
first place you have someone from the

129
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,250
company's legal team because this is a

130
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,630
legal agreement that the company is

131
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,380
going to be signed

132
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,230
it gives permission in sum to sum

133
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,300
greater or lesser degree for this

134
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,730
project to use intellectual property

135
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,110
that was created and owned by the

136
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:40,740
company

137
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,540
so obviously the company's legal team

138
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,620
whether that's internal or external

139
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,600
counsel is going to want to review that

140
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,580
agreement then of course you're going to

141
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,380
have to have someone in the company who

142
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,600
has the authority to sign agreements

143
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,090
giving away the intellectual property of

144
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,130
the company that's not a trivial thing

145
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,040
this is very different from signing an

146
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,130
agreement that says yes we will buy ten

147
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,630
thousand t-shirts a month for the next

148
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,340
three years I mean most of us wouldn't

149
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,480
sign an agreement like that either

150
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,770
because we don't want ten thousand three

151
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,530
shirts a month but for a company to make

152
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,450
a purchasing contract is a relatively

153
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,640
trivial thing and lots of people inside

154
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,140
a company will have permission to do

155
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,180
that sort of thing but as you might

156
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,510
imagine if they're hiring people for

157
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,120
example and a potential employee wants

158
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,070
to negotiate their employment agreement

159
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,390
if the company uses employment

160
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,800
agreements and wants to makes changes to

161
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,710
those permission to negotiate those and

162
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,690
then the authority to sign that is not

163
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,400
something that's doled out tens of

164
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,110
hundreds of people or even tens of

165
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,550
people it's usually a handful of people

166
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,760
and the same is true when any agreement

167
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,320
involving the company's intellectual

168
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,990
property is in place so this will tend

169
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,740
to be a very high-level executive it may

170
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,300
be the company's general counsel in

171
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,370
which case we can actually skip having

172
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,960
four people here and only have three and

173
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,660
then you're gonna have a person like me

174
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,910
who has to navigate these waters and

175
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,100
figure out exactly what process needs to

176
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,500
be done who needs to be brought in where

177
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,120
are the pitfalls so they can make sure

178
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,560
that nobody makes a mistake that could

179
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,860
be damaging down the road at cetera and

180
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,780
that is because of course the developer

181
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,400
is a developer they don't have the

182
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,740
knowledge of understanding what a ççla

183
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,540
looks like and what its terms might mean

184
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,840
and the attorney as good as many of them

185
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,340
are especially in many of their probably

186
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,200
in this room they aren't particularly

187
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,000
familiar with open source software and

188
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,170
license agreements and software

189
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,640
development in general and they could

190
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,950
use some guidance on how the terms that

191
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,870
they're seeing in this Agreement may

192
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,860
apply to the work that's being done so

193
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,620
the first step of course is the

194
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,810
developer Alice's dutiful developer that

195
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,550
follows all the company's policies that

196
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,129
her company

197
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:46,779
she works and she knows immediately

198
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:48,639
before she tries to send any code to an

199
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,080
open-source project that she's supposed

200
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,119
to get permission right that's what all

201
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:54,009
developers every company in the world do

202
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:56,110
right everybody's lying there heads yes

203
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,879
of course that's not what happens but

204
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,499
anyway let's assume of course that

205
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:01,089
that's what happened and so Alice does

206
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:03,009
the right thing and she makes a request

207
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:05,169
however that's supposed to be done email

208
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:07,269
phone call instant message some sort of

209
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:08,619
ticketing system which is what we use

210
00:07:08,619 --> 00:07:10,719
something like that that's gonna get

211
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:12,580
routed to the person who gets to decide

212
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,189
how this is going to proceed that's me

213
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:19,839
in our company so for me to be able to

214
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,949
process Alice's request obviously I'm

215
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:25,449
gonna have to go learn about this

216
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:26,830
project and the first thing I'm going to

217
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,289
learn is yeah they're contributing file

218
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:30,939
in their github repository or wherever

219
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:33,339
else they post their code says that in

220
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:35,050
fact to contribute to their project you

221
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,490
have to sign a contributor License

222
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,679
Agreement might be individual might be

223
00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:40,749
corporate usually it's both if either

224
00:07:40,749 --> 00:07:42,639
exists you would expect the other to

225
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,669
exist as well so what am I gonna need to

226
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:47,739
be able to make these decisions well

227
00:07:47,739 --> 00:07:48,550
I'll be something have to be able to

228
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,610
read okay I mean I can't I can't forward

229
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,559
it along to our legal team for their

230
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:55,539
review and give my notes on how I feel

231
00:07:55,539 --> 00:07:58,329
that it might go if I can't actually be

232
00:07:58,329 --> 00:08:01,329
read it obviously I'm gonna have to be

233
00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:03,459
able to forward it along I'm gonna have

234
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:04,990
to be able to have the person who signs

235
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,839
this agreement be able to do so that

236
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,729
seems like a trivial thing to have to

237
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:12,029
say but just wait till the next slide

238
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:14,649
and then of course once the agreement is

239
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:17,259
signed that agreement can cover and

240
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:19,629
hopefully would cover all employees at

241
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:21,159
our company who want to contribute to

242
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:23,529
that project we hope to not have to do a

243
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:26,860
specialist single a explicit agreement

244
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,319
for each employee that's a lot of work

245
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:31,149
as you might imagine if you're working

246
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:33,309
in a company that has let's say 20,000

247
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:34,448
employees around the world which is

248
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:37,419
roughly what we have getting time on the

249
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:39,279
calendar of the CTO or some other

250
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,990
c-level executive in order for them to

251
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,519
sign an agreement that they don't even

252
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:44,800
understand is a non-trivial thing I

253
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,910
don't want to have to do that any more

254
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:50,589
often than I have to so I've been doing

255
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:52,509
this now at my current employer for a

256
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:55,990
little over four years when I joined we

257
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,610
didn't have very much open source

258
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,140
contributions

259
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,000
going so that was fun for me I got to

260
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,310
build all of this from the ground up but

261
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,690
that means of course I've been exposed

262
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,850
to lots of different things that the

263
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,560
open source projects have chosen and

264
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,960
these are some examples some of these

265
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,010
are really awesome

266
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,840
I've also forgotten any more than I put

267
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,070
up here which is probably because I

268
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,110
didn't like them very much but the first

269
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,030
one is goes back to that readability

270
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:21,900
thing I have literally gone to a

271
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,060
projects website click to the link that

272
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,190
says click here to learn how to sign

273
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,660
just to sign arcane corporate

274
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,910
contributor License Agreement and ended

275
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,010
up in adobe sign which used to be called

276
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,370
echo sign or DocuSign looking at a third

277
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,500
or fourth generation scanned copy of an

278
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,510
agreement that's you know faxed and off

279
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,240
skewed and speckled and everything else

280
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,360
and it's like really they expect

281
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,400
somebody at a big company to read this

282
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,550
and sign it that's not going to happen

283
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,290
not only that of course I can't pull the

284
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,630
text out and have our attorneys review

285
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,730
it because it's not in a form that I can

286
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,150
do that I've seen projects that have

287
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,590
individual contributor license

288
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,540
agreements but no corporate contributor

289
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,340
License Agreement that's just a failure

290
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,070
on their part to understand that the

291
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,540
contribute contributions that they

292
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,160
receive are not always going to be owned

293
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,900
by individuals in some cases they are

294
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,940
going to be owned by companies or other

295
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,050
legal entities that are not people let's

296
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,550
see yeah let's get the other ones due to

297
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,690
two

298
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:25,050
Oh number two that's the most fun one

299
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,610
I'm not gonna name any names here

300
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:30,270
because that's not fair but there is a

301
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,340
large group of projects that are

302
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,900
open-source projects that use a very

303
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,550
friendly open-source licenses and are

304
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,230
really fun projects to work on and we

305
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,900
use many of them and when you go to the

306
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,120
project's source code repository and you

307
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,560
look at the contributing file and it

308
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,730
says hey if you want to learn about how

309
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,500
to contribute to our project click here

310
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,780
you land on their developer website

311
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,050
which requires you to log in to their

312
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,090
social network in order to proceed to

313
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,740
even find out what the terms of the

314
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,430
agreement might be you can imagine how

315
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,930
much I'm willing to use my personal

316
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,150
social network account should I happen

317
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,070
to have one on that network in order to

318
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,780
just review the terms of the agreement

319
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,880
you can imagine how much fun it would be

320
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,440
when I went to the general counsel of

321
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,160
our company and

322
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,259
yeah for you to return this you're gonna

323
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:15,209
have to also login to the social network

324
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:17,069
in order to read it and then it gets a

325
00:11:17,069 --> 00:11:20,370
step further the CTO has to sign this so

326
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,110
I have to have the CTO go logged into

327
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,560
the social now this is clearly not not

328
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,910
useful so I'm gonna go quickly through

329
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,689
the rest of these tech questions the end

330
00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:34,620
alternate go quickly through the rest of

331
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,019
these because unlike good slides I

332
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:38,610
actually have lots of text on these and

333
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,899
then yeah you can read all of these and

334
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:41,279
of course there on the positive website

335
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,509
it's actually where I'm presenting them

336
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:44,129
from so you're welcome to review them

337
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:46,949
later but these are the things that I

338
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:49,410
need in order for me to be able to do my

339
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,569
job well and for me to do my job well

340
00:11:51,569 --> 00:11:54,000
means we get more contributions given to

341
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,459
projects that want them which is of

342
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,079
course what most open source projects

343
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,470
want so I need the text I need an inform

344
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,810
that I can copy it around and hopefully

345
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,399
not ever try to edit it because that

346
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:08,069
would not be fun but to at least be able

347
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:11,839
to copy it around more importantly it's

348
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,519
it's a document it's like a piece of

349
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,589
source code over time it can change

350
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:19,380
people will be notified that maybe terms

351
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,899
in the agreement might not apply the way

352
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:23,069
they thought they did because they were

353
00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:25,110
drafted by a US lawyer but the laws in

354
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,639
the EU are different and so maybe some

355
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,139
additional terms need to be added or

356
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:30,569
something needs to be changed or in

357
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:32,939
cases where you have well this I guess

358
00:12:32,939 --> 00:12:34,529
is true in the EU as well where you have

359
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:36,839
moral rights if the if the kind of

360
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,519
agreement does not contemplate those at

361
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,110
all there are some people who won't sign

362
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,850
them because the agreement doesn't even

363
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,410
say anything about war all rights and

364
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,569
they want it explicitly stated so over

365
00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:47,880
time the agreements going to change you

366
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,160
can imagine how much fun it is when I

367
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,810
download the agreement send it off to

368
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,610
the legal team for review that takes

369
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,160
time I mean days hopefully maybe

370
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,750
sometimes weeks depending on how busy

371
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,910
they are then I have to get scheduled

372
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,430
time for it to get signed when I bring

373
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,259
it up for someone to sign it I have to

374
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:06,509
verify letter by letter that is exactly

375
00:13:06,509 --> 00:13:08,189
the same as the one that we reviewed

376
00:13:08,189 --> 00:13:10,110
because these documents never have

377
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,089
version numbers they don't have any way

378
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:13,350
to know whether they whether there's

379
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,449
been an intentional change or not letter

380
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:19,670
unintentional change that's not good

381
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:22,709
the next thing projects get told they

382
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:24,209
need to have contributor License

383
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:25,100
Agreement

384
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,050
what most project should do like they do

385
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,639
when they pick an open-source license

386
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,829
they should go to the OSI website and

387
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:33,720
say look at all these licenses we have

388
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,029
to pick one pick from let's pick one and

389
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:39,389
use that we've apparently although not

390
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:41,339
completely but we've apparently gotten

391
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:43,589
beyond the end addiction the next major

392
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,209
open source project is gonna roll its

393
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:47,160
own license those days were not fun

394
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,470
we're glad to be beyond them we're not

395
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,089
beyond them for contributor license

396
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:53,790
agreements projects and companies behind

397
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,350
them in some cases we'll just decide

398
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,000
they're gonna write their own you can

399
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,769
imagine then the legal team takes much

400
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:00,240
longer to review them because they're

401
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,100
completely new they've never seen this

402
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,360
before and they don't know what it might

403
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,519
mean I'm also not gonna stress point two

404
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,139
there the second paragraph although it

405
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:12,089
is important for us it may not be as

406
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:14,790
important for other companies we choose

407
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,620
not to contribute to projects where the

408
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,420
contributor License Agreement grants the

409
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,220
project more permissions than it get

410
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,199
grants to its own users which is called

411
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:24,120
asymmetric licensing or inbound not

412
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,500
equal doubt bound or whatever you want

413
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,120
to call it there are other companies

414
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,240
that will but we generally do not so if

415
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,769
you are contemplating putting a

416
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:33,059
contributor License Agreement in place

417
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:34,920
on your project and you are going to

418
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,170
demand more rights from the contributors

419
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,670
than you're then going to give to the

420
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,529
people who get the software out from you

421
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:42,480
that may very well mean that some

422
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,129
companies choose not to contribute to

423
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:49,319
your project so keep that in mind this

424
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:52,649
is going to seem silly because here we

425
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:55,889
are in a room full of geeks doing all

426
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:57,389
this wonderful thing all these wonderful

427
00:14:57,389 --> 00:15:01,379
things that we do in 2017 and yet the

428
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:03,240
simplest and most reliable way to

429
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,279
execute a contributor License Agreement

430
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,829
is literally by printing it out getting

431
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:09,629
someone to sign it and then scanning

432
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:11,189
that and emailing the result to whoever

433
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:14,250
needs it we are capable of using fax

434
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,259
machines I think I know where the one is

435
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:17,759
on the floor that I work on although I

436
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,529
haven't probably touched it in two years

437
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:24,089
but I could if I had to it's unfortunate

438
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,649
that this is the case but this is the

439
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:29,910
case there are also online platforms for

440
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,709
doing signing of documents I mentioned

441
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:33,179
names of some earlier and there are

442
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:33,810
other

443
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,300
the problems with all of them is that

444
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,910
they require the person who's looking at

445
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,440
the document to be the person who's

446
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,300
going to be signing it that's not the

447
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,100
case until you get to the very end of

448
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,570
the process there was at least two other

449
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,589
people who were going to be reviewing

450
00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:51,149
the document I guess I just kind of

451
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:53,579
covered that I would also mention here

452
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:55,110
of course that if you have taken my

453
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,519
advice and put some sort of version

454
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:58,620
number or preferably even a Content hash

455
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,529
as a tag on your document then when we

456
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:03,360
go to sign it on the online execution

457
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,550
platform it should prominently present

458
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,829
that same exact version number so that

459
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:09,300
if it turns out you have changed the

460
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,920
document since we reviewed it will at

461
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,850
least know that you changed and then

462
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,670
this is one that's important as well we

463
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,350
need to be able to add and remove people

464
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:22,050
who have given given permission under

465
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,759
this agreement to contribute to your

466
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,889
project there are a variety of ways

467
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:28,500
that's done some of them it's by just

468
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,759
sending an email to the probably one of

469
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,079
the project leaders and saying hey I had

470
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:32,759
this person and here's their github or

471
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,319
their account or their user email

472
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:35,850
address or whatever that might be in

473
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,610
other cases it's more let's say more

474
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,019
formal than that and they actually have

475
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:41,760
to sign a new copy of the contributor

476
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,050
license agreement with a revised

477
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,730
addendum at the end which is kind of a

478
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:48,510
pain I'll say that on the positive side

479
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,000
a couple of years ago I've heard of

480
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,470
working with a company who did not have

481
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,579
a corporate contributor License

482
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,560
Agreement at all they had an individual

483
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,569
one but not a corporate one and so we

484
00:16:57,569 --> 00:16:58,980
talked about what would be the easiest

485
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,540
thing to do we were actually already

486
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,399
comfortable with the terms of the CLA

487
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:03,480
they were using about me into the

488
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,309
corporate version and they didn't have a

489
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:06,929
plan in place for how they were going to

490
00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:09,299
allow identifying of users who would be

491
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:12,209
allowed to contribute and I said well so

492
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:14,549
your projects hosted on github that

493
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:16,619
means that when we contribute to it

494
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,630
we're going to fork your project in to

495
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,059
our organization on github and then the

496
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:22,380
pull requests that you receive are going

497
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,900
to come from that repository so if

498
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,669
you're willing to just say as long as

499
00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:28,559
the pull request originates from our

500
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,690
Fork of the repository it's covered

501
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:31,620
under the ccoet

502
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,870
I'm good with that because then I can

503
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,549
just use github permission management to

504
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:37,020
decide who has the ability to generate

505
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,580
those pull requests and who doesn't

506
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,620
worked out beautifully I hope more

507
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,699
projects choose to do that

508
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,630
this is another interesting one which

509
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,000
that solves but other mechanisms do not

510
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,740
there are some foundations I guess will

511
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,530
say that the only thing that they asked

512
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,390
for and the only thing that they store

513
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,980
in their database when you give them a

514
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,810
list of contributors is the person's

515
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:05,920
name not an email address not any other

516
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,540
identifiers that you could be used to

517
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,430
tie the contributions that are going to

518
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,800
arrive to that person well I suppose

519
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,150
that could be okay if you have an

520
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,800
incredibly unique name although there's

521
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,180
something like seven billion people in

522
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,380
the world so no name is completely

523
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,140
unique but if you have a relatively

524
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,290
common name which I have run into and

525
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,930
let's say for example hypothetically in

526
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:28,480
the u.s. I have an employee named John

527
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,000
Smith who wanted to contribute to one of

528
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,710
these projects how am I going to feel

529
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,570
about putting the name Smith comma John

530
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,630
as a permitted contributor on the ccoet

531
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,850
how many John Smith's are then going to

532
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,800
be able to potentially try to contribute

533
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,560
under the auspices of my company which I

534
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,600
don't want them to be able to do that's

535
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,140
clearly not what we want

536
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,400
version updates I mentioned before we

537
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,830
should have version numbers if it turns

538
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,480
out that you do need to revise your

539
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,860
contributor License Agreement

540
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,420
anyone who's already signed one should

541
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,640
be told hey by the way we've revised our

542
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,800
contributor License Agreement next time

543
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,450
you come across this you are gonna see

544
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,830
different terms it would be really nice

545
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,390
even of course to include a diff so we

546
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,500
can just look and see what the change

547
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,650
was that has something that has been a

548
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,250
problem in the past as well and then we

549
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,410
also need consistency we need to

550
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,060
understand when you're gonna require us

551
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,460
to do this when we're gonna need to tell

552
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,520
you who people are there is yet another

553
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,530
unnamed but people will know who where

554
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,930
they are quite easily large formation

555
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,670
with hundreds and hundreds of projects

556
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,250
that has very well stated policies for

557
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,140
when contributor license agreements are

558
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,640
required they're on their website

559
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,900
they've been there for years and years

560
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,490
and years they're easy to understand and

561
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,920
yet they're not followed many projects

562
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,930
choose to do more relaxed versions of

563
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,580
these policies because of all the

564
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,020
complications I've been talking about

565
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,880
they don't want to have to do this

566
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,370
for someone who is just going to send

567
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,950
them one patch or two patches we don't

568
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,570
want that

569
00:19:55,570 --> 00:20:00,100
I'm going to skip through this so for

570
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,300
those of you in the audience who are

571
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,760
software developers this is what I want

572
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,680
I want to be able to come to your

573
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,690
project and say wow this is almost

574
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,970
exactly the same as I've seen 26 times

575
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,010
before yes there's little tiny details

576
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:14,590
that are different but that's what I

577
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:18,610
want and this is all because we actually

578
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,500
do want to contribute to your projects

579
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,840
if you make it difficult for us we won't

580
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,400
be able to contribute to your projects

581
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,870
and you won't benefit and we won't

582
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,910
benefit and that's that I've already

583
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,200
being told my time is up which of course

584
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,670
was partly because of the laptop

585
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,680
problems but thank you very much I'm

586
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,150
happy to take questions out in the hall

587
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,050
when we're done here

588
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,250
Thanks

589
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:43,799
[Applause]
