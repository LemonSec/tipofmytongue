1
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:16,460
so welcome third presentation this of

2
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,520
kids about result of this program Google

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,939
Summer of Code last year at the Ostia

4
00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:36,670
I'm margarita delay oh she's so so

5
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,379
google Summer of Code is a program that

6
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:48,920
has been launched okay okay so Google

7
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,449
Summer of Code is a program that has

8
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:52,729
been launched by Google twelve years ago

9
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:56,479
now and it's aimed for student

10
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,530
developers of university age to write

11
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,170
code during the boreal summer so the

12
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,970
northerner misses any sphere summer

13
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,969
so during around three months mentored

14
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:16,189
by open source developers Danny yes

15
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:22,159
that's it so the students apply in

16
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,570
around April they get selected by open

17
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,460
source projects that participate to

18
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,189
Summer of Code they get paired to Mentos

19
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:33,499
so each student gets at least one mentor

20
00:01:33,499 --> 00:01:36,950
that takes care of guiding him or her in

21
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,520
the first steps and on the Google side

22
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,649
of the organization Google selects which

23
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:44,719
organization take part for example with

24
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,319
G OD bein kDa or other universities

25
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:50,899
other projects who have worked on open

26
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:53,090
source and then the organization take

27
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:59,929
care of selecting students I live so in

28
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:03,709
this context of geo applies as a

29
00:02:03,709 --> 00:02:07,609
mentoring organization what is geo is

30
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:09,970
the open source geospatial foundation

31
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,510
that is an umbrella organization that

32
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,550
groups

33
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,270
most geospatial software open-source

34
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:24,340
software that you can find out their

35
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,830
most famous maybe are some of them like

36
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:34,310
quantum G's or G dolla which is beneath

37
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:41,020
several software but there are many more

38
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,990
for example

39
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,880
awesome for example at geo node and so

40
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:53,750
on so we are geo just celebrated its

41
00:02:53,750 --> 00:03:01,940
11th birthday yes yes yesterday of

42
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,010
course if you if you want to know more

43
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:04,880
about it

44
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,710
just visit on our website so geo has

45
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:13,270
participated to google Summer of Code

46
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:19,460
since it began basically because we have

47
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,560
participated disease

48
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,610
we are applied also this year and this

49
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:32,650
is our 11th year and here we present our

50
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:38,030
statistics about our participation so

51
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:43,300
this is the number of students per year

52
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:48,130
and the student that passed the program

53
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:53,989
so we did quite good I would say so this

54
00:03:53,989 --> 00:04:00,320
year we also plan actually to apply also

55
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,489
to a similar program that is dedicated

56
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:08,660
that is targeted to high school students

57
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,850
that is a Googler code in because we we

58
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:17,600
saw that we can get such good

59
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,600
participation such a good outreach to

60
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,300
young developers maybe it's time to

61
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,820
address also the younger generations and

62
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,230
so we put up in

63
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:35,680
place a broader team of administrators

64
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,250
so for this year we are not only me and

65
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,660
Ann but we are seven people taking care

66
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:51,940
of the administration staff for us Jim

67
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:57,650
so last year we got 22 students are

68
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:02,170
accepted and I we asked the student to

69
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:06,860
describe their own work we in in their

70
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:12,590
own words because of course they have

71
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:17,300
their own mentors so we are not here to

72
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,910
explain in detail the work that has been

73
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,220
done because we are not competent about

74
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:26,450
that we our task is the selection of the

75
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:29,000
student taking care of them but then all

76
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,090
the work has been done by the students

77
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:37,460
and by their own mentors so here we

78
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:42,770
present a list of the the projects that

79
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,890
have been developed and in the

80
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,170
description so we gave them a template

81
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:52,460
to fill which is the description of the

82
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,150
project so in this case the student

83
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:00,820
participated with the G doll and he's a

84
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,790
happier Kumar seeking mentored by the

85
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:10,270
Rob Emanuel a raw and it developed and

86
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,890
[Music]

87
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:17,060
basically the support to ogr for some

88
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,800
geometries that were missing so it's

89
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,030
triangulated the surface

90
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:27,830
polyhedral surface and entry angle so

91
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,740
yeah they did those API to do GRE

92
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:38,780
geometry so we asked them to provide a

93
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,360
description of their own

94
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,909
idea and then at the state of the

95
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:47,659
project before the google Summer of Code

96
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:53,490
so in this case he says that according

97
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,860
to the standard that there was no proper

98
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,490
implementation for the distri type of

99
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,310
geometries so the addition to the

100
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:08,639
project provided by him it's such such

101
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,449
modification so here you can find also

102
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:15,090
they are lost at this link you can find

103
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,180
also there are lost the report where

104
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,639
there is also a link to the repository

105
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,259
and all the documentation that can be

106
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:29,039
useful for for you to to go into the

107
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:36,110
detail and here there is a graphical

108
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:40,379
representation of his project of course

109
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:43,139
he represents the ogr classes and he

110
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:47,819
adds the three one that he developed so

111
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,979
the second student also for adult

112
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:55,080
project is Alexander boards ik but I'm

113
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,680
sure I don't pronounce it well so the

114
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:05,419
description here the the W DWG support

115
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:08,490
to the GD Allah and this was a long

116
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,300
wanted feature because the DWG is a

117
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:19,050
proprietary format so it was hard so far

118
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,900
to deal with this kind of data that

119
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,620
comes from a proprietary card the

120
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,759
software and but it's it happens very

121
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,458
often that this kind of file has to be

122
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:36,890
processed in in in GIS so he added

123
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:42,019
support that is totally opened finally

124
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:49,949
so the third student is for a grassy GIS

125
00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:53,850
software is a other Malaysia that

126
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,630
completed the

127
00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:01,019
basic cartography suite in grassy areas

128
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:05,110
through the graphical user interface so

129
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,440
basically what is this is and when you

130
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,759
want to do hardcopy Maps you need to put

131
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:15,870
together the maps in a way that look

132
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:19,870
look good to the eye so we developed the

133
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:27,040
graphical user interface to do that so

134
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,100
here is an example there is the legend

135
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,350
there is the the north

136
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,529
okay so the addition to the project he

137
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:45,300
mentioned this commands that were

138
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,509
previously only the command line and now

139
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:52,300
they have a propeller graphical user

140
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:58,389
interface so another project for a grass

141
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:04,720
ejs is developed by Andrej Pejic that is

142
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,600
a pie cut implementation of the

143
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,680
graphical user interface generated

144
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,189
automatically from XML what does it mean

145
00:10:17,189 --> 00:10:22,569
Graci GIS has a graphical user interface

146
00:10:22,569 --> 00:10:28,899
based on WX python but this create some

147
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:33,569
problem because we noticed that it is

148
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:37,360
strongly platform dependent in a sense

149
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,089
that for example Mac user had some

150
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:50,019
specific related platform issue so since

151
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:55,750
the pike Kuti are a little bit more more

152
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,380
let's say used also from other software

153
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:04,389
and they are doing good the community

154
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:06,309
has decided that this is a good way a

155
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:10,199
good direction to take

156
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,130
in order not to let's say in order to

157
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,860
maintain the graphical user interface

158
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,250
totally separated from the rest of the

159
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:21,880
software

160
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,810
this is generated automatically through

161
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:34,029
XML and he started with an

162
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:37,060
implementation it's this is really a big

163
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,620
big project but he started and developed

164
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,980
a good part of it

165
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,639
so another project through another

166
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:53,380
project for a grass jeez sorry ok

167
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,560
because we asked that the students to

168
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,839
provide their pictures but they are not

169
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:02,350
obliged to so for those who didn't

170
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,949
provide we choose a picture so there is

171
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:11,139
a troll face so this student developed

172
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:15,070
another project for a grassy GIS is my

173
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:18,670
akka Agrawal and the title of the

174
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,120
project is web grass basically what he

175
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:30,010
did he developed an interface web base

176
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,790
the graphical user interface for the

177
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,199
software

178
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:37,329
graça and this is very useful also for

179
00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:39,880
example when you want to give courses

180
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:46,360
because the installation can be some

181
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,350
sometimes tricky during the course so

182
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:56,019
you may want to skip this face so but

183
00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:59,949
it's also a good way for example for

184
00:12:59,949 --> 00:13:05,290
collaborative use of the of the of the

185
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:13,199
software and this is how it looked like

186
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:19,329
so I will go on with the gvsig spanish

187
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:22,660
GIS software and with one student

188
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,610
: bono who worked on DVS education

189
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,569
project that was about creating

190
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:30,940
automated tests that are for example

191
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,079
used in a school environment and

192
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:39,339
teachers can fill up a template in open

193
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:43,870
document format and this generates the

194
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,670
Associated maps that could be used as

195
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,879
quizzes and this is already used in its

196
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:52,689
committee to the source code we had a

197
00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:55,120
second project that was done by Silvia

198
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,269
Franceschi and it's about ideology in

199
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:00,670
the mountain areas and especially in

200
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:04,720
wooded areas and this project is about

201
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,350
the modernization of floods in process

202
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:12,100
of wood cover because the models that

203
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,160
were available before are not so exact

204
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,279
so the actual runs of the model could

205
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:22,240
not correspond to real situations now it

206
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,410
is with this improved model you have

207
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,360
visualization of the actual stand and a

208
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,939
better modernization of the flow we have

209
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:36,850
projects students who worked on East

210
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:41,470
sauce that is a fairly new piece of

211
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:45,730
software that is this project focused

212
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,720
these and the next ones focus on giving

213
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,600
unit interfaces and joining it with

214
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,019
other pieces of software so flooring

215
00:14:59,019 --> 00:14:59,769
Daniel shorabak

216
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:05,740
working on an android client I want to

217
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,870
add only one word about our student the

218
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:11,800
Florina who joined the the admin team

219
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,490
this year so after being a student last

220
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:20,139
year it decided to help us let's say

221
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:24,189
reaching more students yeah yeah I

222
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:25,180
forgot to mention that

223
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,550
among the Mentors many of them so I

224
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,189
think around half of them were former

225
00:15:30,189 --> 00:15:32,769
students so we are very happy very happy

226
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:34,930
this that there is this turnover of

227
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,400
people who

228
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,930
know what it is to be a student know

229
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,640
what the student could need in terms of

230
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,100
help and they are really the right

231
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,130
people to provide eye to eye level help

232
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:48,700
to new students so this is the scheme of

233
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:57,010
flowing work Luca on Easter's work on

234
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:00,580
web publishing of East services so a Web

235
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:05,370
API and these are some of the

236
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,600
visualization that is now possible with

237
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,110
these tools so some graphs this is the

238
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:14,910
configuration area the map and some of

239
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:20,040
more compact visualization Philippe

240
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,690
provident work specifically on charts

241
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:28,840
that I show no I think it was very much

242
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,640
picture I'm very sorry it's it's present

243
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,400
on our like online presentation I hope

244
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,090
it doesn't happen really frosty Filippo

245
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,340
worked with the NASA world wind and

246
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,460
Gabrielle he was actually member of the

247
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,040
team of the previous presenter so a very

248
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,130
power that is also present here with

249
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:52,390
NASA and NASA is actually not a popper

250
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:56,230
with geo member as a project but this is

251
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,880
I mean this is a big discussion of what

252
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,730
was you should should do as in certified

253
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:06,970
software or being open to to consider

254
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,390
open source geospatial even software

255
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,329
that is not under audio hood this is a

256
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:15,130
big thing that is continuously being

257
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:18,970
discussed in algae but in Summer of Code

258
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,640
we wanted to be open to any open source

259
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,160
geospatial project so we had every year

260
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,500
guests project guests in the south of

261
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,130
West geo and you want to consider them

262
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:34,150
as proper part of our top and Gabriela

263
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:36,550
made the web application that uses NASA

264
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,520
web world wind framework as a base and

265
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,230
then adds plots three dimensional plots

266
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,790
on it and it's really fancy

267
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:50,900
we had one project on openlayers three

268
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,360
from someone Lapointe mentored by

269
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,250
Jessica lap and it is not a religion

270
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,650
they said and she was one of our

271
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,210
students for example for a couple of

272
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:05,600
years and someone worked on the upper

273
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,850
layers three google maps library that is

274
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,390
the library that allows to overlay

275
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:15,200
Google and not Google Maps the problem

276
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,600
was that when this library was used the

277
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,240
functions and the the animation that

278
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,039
wasn't done on the maps was not

279
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,539
consistent in the rest of the

280
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,309
application so you rewrote the library

281
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:31,690
sort of and now the Refresh of the map

282
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,470
doesn't show these distinct

283
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:37,280
organizations anymore so this is what he

284
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,950
did as in the code as in you see the

285
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,840
visualization doesn't change much but

286
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:49,720
it's really much more fluid we had one

287
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,020
guest project is in transit time that is

288
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:58,309
about public transport oats and routing

289
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:02,650
and Brendan Egan worked on a QuickStart

290
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,150
setup for this application because it is

291
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,250
it is a very new project so installing

292
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,440
and running it is sort of troublesome

293
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,330
for non developers and even for the belt

294
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,250
that developers they were they were

295
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:18,320
telling us and so it provided this

296
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,409
QuickStart that is also a demo so one

297
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:24,260
can also just use it to show to see the

298
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,169
functionality of this project and or to

299
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:30,200
set up his own instance on your own

300
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:30,679
computer

301
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:33,380
and this is what you see so you see for

302
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,140
example how I wrote for public transfer

303
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,770
with the stops and each stops as proper

304
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,340
information

305
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:47,460
so this is another project for awesome

306
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:52,860
developed by Martina dorita she did with

307
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,610
us more than one year Google Summer of

308
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:59,970
Code project and she completed them err

309
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,840
a project of complete a photogrammetric

310
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:08,970
awesome tool of forum for the generation

311
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:15,720
of DSM from us our images I think we

312
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:23,700
should go a little bit faster so this is

313
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,550
how it looks like but in the

314
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,140
presentation you will find out all the

315
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,830
links to find all the material related

316
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:36,630
to although of the project this this is

317
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:41,040
a PG routing routing developed to

318
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,130
project we do student first one andrea

319
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:48,420
nardelie developed the flow algorithms

320
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:54,800
for a PG routing that specific flow

321
00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:04,230
algorithms not just routing so this is a

322
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:10,440
graphical representation of it and this

323
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,750
is the second for Apogee routing sanke

324
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:17,220
paliotta ready implementation of a

325
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,620
framework which supports addition of a

326
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,230
contraction techniques

327
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:25,499
[Music]

328
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,670
this project is a very nice explanation

329
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:34,830
because you can simplify a graph when a

330
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,110
graph is very big you can simplify all

331
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,840
the segments that are linear with

332
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,780
several nodes on it you can compact the

333
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,730
nodes in this short notation this

334
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:47,940
doesn't influence the connection of the

335
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,570
graph but it makes it simpler and

336
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,880
smaller in memory so you can this is the

337
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,530
other contraction that is implemented so

338
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,060
when there is another linear path with

339
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,790
more nodes they can be condensed in only

340
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:06,040
one and this speedups computational lot

341
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:11,810
by the DPS Ian Rudolph worked on a web

342
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:15,100
interface to start stop and pause

343
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:21,340
processes that are run by pi WPS so now

344
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,960
you can actually do that that those are

345
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,050
functionality does not yet available

346
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:34,430
akbar kabira worked on QGIS so he

347
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:38,690
developed a plugin for sharing symbols

348
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:44,600
and style size symbols for for maps for

349
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:50,090
the the user to to share this this kind

350
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:55,720
of the same resources yes

351
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:02,980
so here it is how it looks like finally

352
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,650
there are two projects developed within

353
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:13,730
zoo project one is bringing the PI

354
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:17,120
modest to the web rule zoo project

355
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,740
so this basically brings the the

356
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,800
functionality of a tool called the PI

357
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,190
modest that process downloads and

358
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:33,160
processes modest to the web basically

359
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:37,370
seamlessly and and the last one was

360
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:41,930
actually a project not only for a sous

361
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:46,160
project by the combining zu j grass

362
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,590
tools and geo paparazzi that are three

363
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:54,080
software and this is a sort of binding

364
00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:02,180
from between them so if you received so

365
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,330
much information you can visit this

366
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:08,990
webpage to find out more I just wanted

367
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,850
to okay

368
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:19,010
yes we want to thank our Google

369
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:23,640
administrator in the fund and you can

370
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,990
find her and other google Summer of Code

371
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:31,620
people at the stand in building K so

372
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,980
you're welcome to directly ask them

373
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:38,150
thank you thank you

374
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:44,640
[Applause]
