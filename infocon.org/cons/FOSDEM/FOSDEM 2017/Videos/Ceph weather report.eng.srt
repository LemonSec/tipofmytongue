1
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:08,599
well I am the last one and thank you for

2
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:09,139
attending

3
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:13,820
we all are tired I'm tired and hello

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,160
again for anyone who was in the morning

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,689
so now I'm going to talk about

6
00:00:17,689 --> 00:00:19,789
Secretariat for so I'm going to talk

7
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:25,279
what is new with that with last few

8
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,320
witnesses so we're gonna top what we

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,239
Joel is the latest don't young variant

10
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:39,010
and what we talkin that were without and

11
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:46,160
Dominus so that has a long-term

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,779
relationship Emily

13
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:59,980
although Tommy was and actually Hamilton

14
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,899
love now I think it will be the last

15
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:11,180
hammer version and it's done it's a

16
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,610
shuttle business let's not spoil any

17
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:20,869
more jewel went out in April 16 and now

18
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:24,979
and companies out January we are really

19
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:29,408
sad that it's a short term released but

20
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:34,500
and no meanness is time to replace it 70

21
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:41,800
so let's start your job so I'm not gonna

22
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,260
go in detail and successfully very

23
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,750
complex I'll go really quickly what's a

24
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,620
field so we had we have three services

25
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,740
the staff provides sufferfest for public

26
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,830
file system we have a PD for block

27
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,740
storage and let us get away I hope

28
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,350
everybody healed I assume no sets and

29
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:06,670
doesn't need more details if so you can

30
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,520
see the video from the morning so we

31
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,250
don't have time with a short

32
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:18,660
presentation they all used a library for

33
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,040
object storage API the brothers and

34
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,540
underneath we have the set cluster with

35
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,330
us that provide the distributed object

36
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:33,910
storage so first we start with the

37
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,130
festival everyone always ask me about

38
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,760
surface so we waited long time for such

39
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:47,080
FS and favorite class enjoy but we have

40
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,830
several limitation we only recommend

41
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,770
using single active MDS the metadata

42
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,830
server you can have many standbys but

43
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:02,130
only one active and do not use nations

44
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,989
we have repaired and disaster recovery

45
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:07,900
tools and we have integration with

46
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:13,380
Manila and a lot of authentication

47
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,990
improvements

48
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:23,790
so this is a bit more about the MDS so

49
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,150
you want to scare fire performance so

50
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,120
there I hope article by adding all these

51
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,590
to the systems and first using SSD it's

52
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,190
always good no performance and you can

53
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,220
have lots of memory files and Al are

54
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,130
very large file systems and then the

55
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,950
effect path through better performance

56
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,490
and the cache is limited or the cache

57
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:53,340
size is related to the active state you

58
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,530
use another number of file you have

59
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,490
enough assets and you can add more

60
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,560
welcome than BS to improve the

61
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,680
performance and we always recommend

62
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,080
using necessities for the metadata pool

63
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:16,980
and what so yes so the idea of MDS

64
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,399
informated and service survey but it's

65
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,340
dynamic you actually each Methodist

66
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:28,170
server handles part of your filesystem

67
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,420
according to the load so a Methodist

68
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,450
server can actually serve one directory

69
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,930
if it's very loaded and the ID it will

70
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,060
be active active and dynamic and we

71
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,090
actually care you can see that it stops

72
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,600
being loaded and maybe so directories so

73
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,550
all the parties I mean gonna use them

74
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,860
nama clean efficient

75
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:58,650
we are have consistent cash in plant can

76
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:03,660
use cash and they are coherent and we

77
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:10,860
have invalidation in cash of update we

78
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,320
have bastards and other stuff so

79
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,150
snapshots are disabled for defaulting

80
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,690
joke and we also buy dominance they will

81
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:28,890
be enabled by different that's what our

82
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:33,720
object regularity our VDS very huge

83
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,450
snapshots and surfaces can snapshot any

84
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:43,200
sub directory smooth the bid we have f

85
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,230
ck and cover with tool there are

86
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,750
physical ones we have all the operation

87
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,620
to fix her file system the moment in

88
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:59,400
Joule its manual how can that scrubbing

89
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,380
is will be automatic in cotton animals

90
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,300
and we have us terekhov a tool to

91
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,190
rebuild the file system in case of

92
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,490
breath

93
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,400
there is interaction with the Manila

94
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,400
from going the mower Julius is

95
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,240
integrated into motika but I'm I don't

96
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,390
know about the u.s. open stock version

97
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:31,010
and less involved in opposite

98
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,180
either you do stuff so we all know you

99
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,230
want everything itself user longer do it

100
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:44,230
we have se Linux support system and it

101
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,290
is complete we are now also have second

102
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:52,660
samples install safe using sambal feel

103
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,500
like pass completion and calamari on

104
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,300
month we built forms from willful to

105
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:11,490
humble and their Armour for Debian Jesse

106
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,820
happy so I will be supporting our image

107
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,150
me way that means you move the image to

108
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:23,650
different no this is a synchronous

109
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:29,620
application to different cluster their

110
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,370
articles the first consistent Delta Chi

111
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:37,810
step image we use the data journal for

112
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,100
an image support the classical system

113
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,860
there's a demon for album when he needs

114
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,140
to be that does all the work

115
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:56,710
that's other Batista firmness deep deep

116
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:00,550
flattening you can turn off many

117
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:06,640
features turn on on off check out our

118
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,300
video and Bella ciela

119
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:15,370
let us get away so if we have been doing

120
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,770
we revision Alden multisite ago

121
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,620
applications so we normally use the

122
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,440
single sync engine for education

123
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,389
everything is done but there are you

124
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:28,990
scared for itself we have active active

125
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,458
and zones application we have failover

126
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:36,549
and failback and simplify the

127
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:40,089
configuration we also have NFS interface

128
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:44,709
for where this gateway it's supporting

129
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:49,930
the only NFS before it used to import or

130
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,110
export data to the object storage it's

131
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,330
based on elephants Ganesha a link with

132
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:59,890
me buddy W we have indexed LS bucket for

133
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:03,279
very for users who are using lots of

134
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,410
object in the same bucket minions or

135
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,750
ones and those are buckets that don't

136
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,339
maintain the index at all

137
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:12,910
you cannot list them but that's make the

138
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,940
operation of them faster because we

139
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,100
don't maintain index currently you

140
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,270
cannot use your application we need

141
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,820
hopefully in cockin probably lumineuse

142
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,339
will have your application also for

143
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:29,670
index

144
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,080
lots of updates

145
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,780
most of the suite-style stuff we've done

146
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,300
by new vantage so I want to continue on

147
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,820
this there

148
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,400
so for Swift we have Keystone be free

149
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,710
multi-tenancy of the Declaration SLO

150
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,870
block delete object versioning and let's

151
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:56,640
go compliance f4 is a test and first we

152
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,200
we ate AWS for authentication support

153
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:07,500
LDAP support SPX is nothing Joe SPSS fix

154
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,800
good token server it will hopefully be

155
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,709
in calc and pardon ominous

156
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,579
it's a token service Amazon uses its 14

157
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:28,259
very complex communication external or

158
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:32,040
dedicated servers so this user can get

159
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,920
from that server token and that is

160
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,160
passed to the storage and adult

161
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:46,649
education yeah exactly and lots of there

162
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:50,730
is free user one yeah

163
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:56,160
so now I just we prove chewing and the

164
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,360
monitor capability lots of optimization

165
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:13,170
useless Fred and perform better we know

166
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,480
all of your support X before we leave

167
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,300
aside but because this accessibility

168
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,720
Mexico are too small now especially with

169
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,079
our BD and also we always get way you

170
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:26,790
can get Co option because they're

171
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:30,629
accessible too short so we only support

172
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:36,089
X offense it's very important we improve

173
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:40,459
caching and we added the basic coding

174
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:43,319
sacrifice according to this who added

175
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:48,089
that and blue so Bluto is very important

176
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:53,040
to so surf is built on top of a file

177
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,399
system in the end we saw our data in a

178
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,800
file system and there's a layer we

179
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,550
called first off the dialog currently we

180
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:06,629
do it on experts but we noticed our

181
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:08,790
write performance we have lots of

182
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,860
latency issues because of the exit

183
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:15,990
and also maybe it's much more complex to

184
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,420
use it because we actually use several

185
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,810
files and we need to synchronize

186
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:24,180
updating that it's a blue star remove

187
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,330
that layer and instead of using XFS it

188
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,780
actually uses a device or device and

189
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,140
also accuses their work the b4 side key

190
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,890
value stock for the metal hopefully a

191
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,770
blue so is this beginning of full a

192
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:48,840
luminous will be the default are we

193
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,270
talking about talking low enough so that

194
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,820
is to make blue so the default blue

195
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:59,190
incarnate would be in but it will still

196
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:02,070
be trivial but anomalous hopefully it

197
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,260
will be production ready and going to

198
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,310
spawn in person when we already have

199
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,410
actually where is it called override for

200
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:13,830
a body so we have we can actually use

201
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:17,760
how to deal with us recording pulse set

202
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,200
manager is a new complement of self it's

203
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,060
like a monitor but it's external demand

204
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,770
it's written in Python it will have

205
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:33,780
Westerby eyes and have metrics and first

206
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,970
of all it will move some load from the

207
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,920
monitor that does other stuff then

208
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,360
actually the clustering and it also

209
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,590
improve our matrix and can also have

210
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:50,090
with managing sacrifice

211
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,720
we're adding on underwire Christian

212
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,279
optimize the iPad for the USB make the

213
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:02,779
pin faster and more quality of service

214
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:06,230
sub this will have sub this support

215
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,779
mentally of it worried that this support

216
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:12,560
rhodium cache we can and flash cache we

217
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,490
have the DM Kashyap and natural battles

218
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:19,399
they are fully be thereby luminous by

219
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:22,550
the scale again this yesterday I was on

220
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:27,800
like or Trevor's pluggable foods on

221
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,350
sinking so that is that we can

222
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:36,290
absolutely export tomato data out and we

223
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:40,010
can use that that for first of all for

224
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:43,160
metadata indexing method in research so

225
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,170
we can export the data into elastic

226
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,459
source and then the user can actually

227
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:47,810
search the metadata

228
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:51,950
it can also be used for tearing idle for

229
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:57,290
take of cloud storage excel like public

230
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:01,850
lab we had in we have in picture from

231
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,040
thanks to my auntie's and cooperation of

232
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,830
object and we are doing lots of

233
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:10,640
performance improvements there is a work

234
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,839
to scale up the performance of civic web

235
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:18,560
content and we are looking at our

236
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,920
performance with the bucket with lots of

237
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,349
objectives and so on

238
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,920
for IBD we continue improving the

239
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,220
mirroring adding in high availability

240
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:40,200
deliver application and for positive

241
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:45,930
demons and we I mean it's a client-side

242
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:51,870
system caching and kitchen the lots of

243
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:54,740
improvement for the kernel client

244
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:59,250
performance this RVD back to LA oh I

245
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,519
study targets we need a scuzzy because

246
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:05,040
user want to be aware and the only way I

247
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,350
can use of believe is great work is ice

248
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,240
cut

249
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,209
we are doing consistently both the

250
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:14,760
surface that we hopefully will have

251
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,860
multi active members will make the

252
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,420
surface more scalable and put more

253
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,820
performance snaps that will be there

254
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,850
they are not yet in Cochran and as the

255
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,810
manila integration there is integration

256
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,700
with Samba thoughts and being gave me

257
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:38,310
Charcot NFS and see if you have the with

258
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,640
shackles

259
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:47,910
dismantle that Lua plug-in multi MVS

260
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:51,360
balancer we add in some directive

261
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,850
fermentation movement and the static

262
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,170
[Music]

263
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:09,720
suppose ipv4 6:00 p.m. so this is the

264
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,299
back end this is the end reading

265
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:16,319
back-end support for maintenance and you

266
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,819
need widest back end or CB so it's not

267
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:21,359
to stuff

268
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:26,178
anyone in something specific you want us

269
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:34,870
so set bouncy ball is a way to deploy

270
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,860
safe in unstable and so there is the way

271
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:45,820
it is rather India and so in Sibelius I

272
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:49,800
saw the young falcon sample and how to

273
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,630
and set the current in place for a while

274
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,970
but it's a way to run certain containers

275
00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:01,200
in docker and deployed that works yes

276
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:29,909
yeah yeah me too again the 500 yeah well

277
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:34,830
it's an external project so you can try

278
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,710
on the melon this

279
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:41,700
can you try on safe mailing list see if

280
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,909
anyone knows about it probably say maybe

281
00:18:53,660 --> 00:19:02,250
yes Seth Manoj's an additional demon do

282
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,500
you know do we have to have Seth manager

283
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,850
in the cluster I'm not

284
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,910
so if you don't have anything that's

285
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:21,670
using

286
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:25,420
to our API or you're not running some

287
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,970
sort of management or movie dashboard or

288
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,710
anything like that then yes you should

289
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,270
be able to run a cluster about that

290
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,140
I don't think the the question of

291
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,730
horizontal scalability has been quite

292
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,529
intricate I mean obviously they're going

293
00:19:46,529 --> 00:19:50,960
to watch you into question whether it's

294
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,149
my thinking

295
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:17,090
okay he wants SS production slopes of

296
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,460
production and you act if you do the

297
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,970
pockets so first you'll always long-term

298
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:28,309
Kraken is shorter and just out so that

299
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:30,770
mean it has lots of new tools features

300
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:35,990
it's passed some testing we do up train

301
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:40,539
but most user never used it

302
00:20:49,200 --> 00:21:03,649
I don't know actually

303
00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:16,380
yeah I'm assuming one name but I don't

304
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,870
think blue story is there yet to that

305
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:25,129
point oh yes

306
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:37,110
well that is to try to limit well it's

307
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:40,619
more for hyperconvergence so we can win

308
00:21:40,619 --> 00:21:44,869
one if they always be with other such

309
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:48,389
service and we can try to limit the

310
00:21:48,389 --> 00:21:51,600
resources or place a quality of service

311
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,759
enough for each one in Quechua now I

312
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:58,379
think in general self is not really

313
00:21:58,379 --> 00:22:02,850
strong goodness 12 yourself we have

314
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,869
anything to add other

315
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,229
[Music]

316
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,690
the icing messenger we're talking about

317
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,780
so the for aspire submitted so there was

318
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,420
some reading issue it spawned too many

319
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,330
feds and suddenly too many friends

320
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,220
usually it's not good for your

321
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,600
performance so it's less spreads I don't

322
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,580
know exactly the implementation I wasn't

323
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,870
that involved that but

324
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,890
yeah yeah a lot of the scaling issues

325
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,530
have been addressed there's actually a

326
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:02,530
collection

327
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:23,359
yeah so the 20 is we are much more yeah

328
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:27,080
any more questions

329
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:46,869
yes

330
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,879
and we moved maybe weather does it

331
00:23:51,879 --> 00:23:54,250
sometimes weather decide that well this

332
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,860
is upstair but but it's and I decided to

333
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,080
support something that up screen may

334
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,500
continue to do it not always one to one

335
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,710
I think there was some issue of in some

336
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:09,220
cases cache ta provider it's some bugs

337
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,820
in it cause some co-option so that's why

338
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,730
it's not supported I actually believe

339
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:19,450
it's gonna be supporting it's too ma'am

340
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:22,809
my name is it's not gonna stop and again

341
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:27,120
many missus always good place like

342
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:37,649
to kind of rework it

343
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,260
they'll be able to push things will hop

344
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,590
here

345
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,940
as far as red hats

346
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,960
I know I didn't Oh God

347
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,600
so I can say for example we go in the

348
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,060
lab with the we talking about Big Data

349
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:29,360
so adopt for on their way this gateway

350
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,250
something we're talking about the

351
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:38,440
professed it should be also well for

352
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,440
deployment

353
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:08,759
thank you
