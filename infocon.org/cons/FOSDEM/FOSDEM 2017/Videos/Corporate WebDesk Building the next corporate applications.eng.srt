yes I can work outside and we'll talk

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,090

forever is okay that is a Spanish

13
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,450
consultancy firm that is part of the

14
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,930
entity latter group okay you can find me

15
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,930
around in Twitter meaning it HAP okay I

16
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,840
have my also my own blog that I mainly

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,770
blog about Microsoft technologies but

18
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,489
also more and more about other things

19
00:00:58,489 --> 00:00:59,379
okay

20
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:04,069
why because mainly I become a consultant

21
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:05,869
related with Microsoft technologies okay

22
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:08,420
I grow from developer to architect and

23
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,729
then lead architect okay so it's also a

24
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:13,420
alright for me to come to an open source

25
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,100
event with Microsoft technologies and

26
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,440
also will realize that I'm with a Mac so

27
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,510
I think it looks promising Microsoft

28
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:24,320
architect Mac and open source okay so I

29
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,130
want to talk about two things today the

30
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,490
first one a crazy idea that that I have

31
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,619
in my mind and how we are applying

32
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:36,320
Microsoft technologies to to try to make

33
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,090
it real okay I want to start with with

34
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,670
three simple questions okay how many of

35
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,570
you are involved in some way with

36
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:49,180
corporate or Department applications

37
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,659
okay good

38
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:56,869
using Microsoft technologies good but

39
00:01:56,869 --> 00:02:00,290
you know how many or how many plan to

40
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,270
use a some corporate applications in the

41
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,780
future if they are not applying it now

42
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,040
okay you're not thinking to change

43
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:13,189
anything okay okay when I talk when I

44
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:16,040
say corporate applications I'm I'm into

45
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,020
error

46
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,210
there P CRN CRS okay those kind of

47
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,400
technologies that the companies need to

48
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,760
run their business okay because there

49
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,880
are a lot of solutions okay that in the

50
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,330
market that the companies need to choose

51
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,880
need to assess and then install and then

52
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,550
maintain over over the time and

53
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,820
experience are running running in as

54
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,160
consultants in Spain I've been a while

55
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,500
hearing in Brussels on now also in

56
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,620
Switzerland I realized that there's

57
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,180
several problems okay with the new

58
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,620
solutions that you find on the market

59
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,200
not they are expensive solution with

60
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,550
closed source okay

61
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,800
they are fairly difficult to integrate

62
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,350
one between others you have you can buy

63
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,090
a big s ap but then it's really

64
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,320
difficult to integrate with other

65
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,500
solutions for instance sometimes the

66
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,360
user experience is ugly and it's

67
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,640
something that is very very important in

68
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,280
today's mobile mobile first world

69
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,710
users are reduced to beautiful user

70
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,200
interface so it's a very very common

71
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,400
problem we set up the motor stance is is

72
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,350
painful now you need a very complex

73
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,380
process of deployment and it's really

74
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,450
difficult to adjust the business okay

75
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,700
you always try to keep these corporate

76
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,310
applications as the standard as possible

77
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,920
and don't talk about switching from one

78
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,200
product to up to order because is it's

79
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,260
really a pain there's a lot of people

80
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,360
that you can see around us here

81
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,490
important is creating some technologies

82
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:56,890
so that are disconnected now you can you

83
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:01,720
have a lot of dots in India path that if

84
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,090
we make this go into this quote from the

85
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,160
Stanford commencement speech 2005 of

86
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,760
Steve Jobs he said you can connect the

87
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,010
dots looking forward you can connect

88
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,980
only them looking backward so you have

89
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,108
to trust that the dots will some connect

90
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:22,660
in the future okay so we have who will

91
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,840
go around and see all the dots that the

92
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,990
people is putting on the table right now

93
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,530
and you have a look for example in this

94
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,120
dot that is the iPhone and the dot that

95
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,699
Apple then realize oh so the app store

96
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:46,479
we firstly think why there is no web

97
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,669
desktop that provides the ability to

98
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:51,220
companies to deploy the corporate

99
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,560
applications like the personal app

100
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,259
stores do know why there is no a click

101
00:04:56,259 --> 00:04:59,320
and deploy so you can modularize or you

102
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,120
can choose the best solution for your

103
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,810
company

104
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,240
and you need to go for standard

105
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,060
solutions closed solutions that the you

106
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,849
can not customize you cannot integrate

107
00:05:09,849 --> 00:05:11,410
because there's a battle be chilled in

108
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,710
companies so weak why we can open a new

109
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,289
business model where any developer in

110
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:21,039
the world can create a module that can

111
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,870
be deploy to App Store and any company

112
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,340
in the world can download no so this is

113
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,960
more or less what I actually believe

114
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,000
know that with existing technologies

115
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,909
like we said we saw before for example

116
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:36,639
with kubernetes cornetist

117
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,639
we can save all of that automation tools

118
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,949
that we have right now in the market if

119
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:44,680
we connect them all and we put the right

120
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,750
investment and vision we can create a

121
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,900
new new business model we a corporate

122
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,139
web desktop ok where does with an

123
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:56,050
attached app store inside ok covering

124
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,270
all the business needs that that a

125
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,409
company may have because maybe big

126
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:04,270
companies have the budget that they need

127
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:09,070
to install for example one big solution

128
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,229
okay for a CRM or whatever but when

129
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:13,120
you're in start-up you don't have that

130
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,909
budget but you have more or less the

131
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,710
same needs you need to control your

132
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,360
money you need to control your clients

133
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,380
so for instance they did all this small

134
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,759
company that starting would be

135
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,710
immediately benefited from from this

136
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:31,300
this kind of tools and they give us to

137
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,620
the to second partner who can

138
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,320
technically we are trying to approach to

139
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,180
this model because the salon passed away

140
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,490
and we would later we're trying to

141
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,590
switch using Microsoft's technologies

142
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:47,039
from a model where we develop using

143
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:49,990
application that manually deployed to

144
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:54,279
the to this to IAS or whatever ok and

145
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:58,240
trying to switch to a it's not a micro

146
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,090
service from way to an IP I model ok

147
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,940
where every application is splitted in

148
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,699
two sides the first side is the front

149
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:08,500
end that is completely disconnected from

150
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,810
the back end ok

151
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:13,570
and the only and only point of interest

152
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:16,150
is this web desktop ok so any user that

153
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,310
wants to get into the platform they have

154
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:22,630
the single sign-on point of entrance

155
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,490
they get into the desktop and the

156
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:27,669
desktop is getting the information from

157
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:30,219
all the applications that inside ok

158
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:34,539
these make this big cluster of of

159
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:36,880
applications and this is also true for

160
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,680
mobile phones we can extend also this

161
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,310
model to create some sort of corporate

162
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,800
applications that read from all these

163
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,560
apply and back-end assistance that we

164
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,659
are deploying ok this is something that

165
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:56,500
is real is in our hand now because you

166
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,870
know using Microsoft technologies you

167
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,599
can create a kubernetes cluster in Ezzor

168
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,760
you can deploy the front-end

169
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,669
technologies and debugging technologies

170
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:09,669
split it and offer the service scaling

171
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:13,870
basically as the user needs in your own

172
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,180
premises in your private or your public

173
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:16,870
cloud

174
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,349
ok so this is I see this and I think

175
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:23,740
that if something that is misused this

176
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,529
technology has a lot of power that a

177
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:30,010
player applying the right the right

178
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,409
changes or the right effort we can

179
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:36,039
create something something more ok but

180
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:39,099
this is a long road okay and we are

181
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:41,708
barely in the first step no we're trying

182
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:42,530
to

183
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:45,740
set a base development framework

184
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,450
okay base it on Dubna technologies

185
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,990
because it's one of the technologies

186
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,140
that we at Everest use okay we are not

187
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,630
only Microsoft based we have Microsoft

188
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:01,280
Oracle ASAP we cover the vast variety of

189
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,770
technologies that the market demands but

190
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:08,150
I wanted to relate in one on on one of

191
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,430
our bases on that it was the the

192
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,290
Microsoft technologies our leverage our

193
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,080
knowledge on on it to create this okay

194
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,760
so we need to set this base framework we

195
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,690
to architect define and implement this

196
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,410
video of web desktop that you can deploy

197
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,960
the application automatically and run

198
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:34,610
them define an app store model open to

199
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,190
everyone so they can connect get any

200
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,450
application they need for this business

201
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,390
and get it to run okay

202
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:43,670
create the model the app store fill it

203
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,230
that is the hard part because you need a

204
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,890
lot a lot of business knowledge that a

205
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,560
lot of companies maybe half in the

206
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:57,260
market put it on the way okay so the

207
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:01,000
first step okay how we are trying to

208
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,830
make this first step to create our web

209
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,170
desktop using Microsoft technologies

210
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,170
okay so we started from this point that

211
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:13,910
is more or less how we use to architect

212
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,860
solutions for from Microsoft

213
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,390
technologies okay we used jQuery in the

214
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:23,270
for in the front end combined with some

215
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:27,140
sort of server rendering okay using WCF

216
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,420
services okay this is sounds familiar

217
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,170
for some of you you know I used to do

218
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:36,400
Microsoft technologies more or less okay

219
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,440
most of them were closed source okay was

220
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,060
on on the Microsoft control and they

221
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,360
okay we know what this means okay

222
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,450
and with this development model we found

223
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,780
that we have several issues for example

224
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,899
we found that we have

225
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:56,730
performance problem problems for

226
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,449
instance in the in the front-end

227
00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:03,779
development point of bill because all

228
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:07,529
these problems with the VA were state no

229
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:08,670
the state management okay

230
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,860
all these implements the half the server

231
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,050
rendering okay we also have problems

232
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,199
with the maintainability okay with the

233
00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:19,619
HTML and angeas hate that them many of

234
00:11:19,619 --> 00:11:23,220
the developers demonstrated to us when

235
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,470
we painted the we we set this

236
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,389
architecture set and don't feel

237
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:29,670
comfortable with HTML rather than do

238
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:34,139
this in the backend okay problems with

239
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:35,459
this architecture with the user

240
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:37,679
experience okay in the elasticity of the

241
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:40,379
solutions how we can scale or who can

242
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:43,170
give all these all the resources that

243
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,339
the companies needs okay

244
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:49,769
from the costs and from them from the

245
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:52,170
economic point of view the development

246
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,179
and maintenance and the hosting were not

247
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:58,319
cheap okay the time to market and the

248
00:11:58,319 --> 00:12:03,779
also the integration okay so we had to

249
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:09,269
find a point so we can improve starting

250
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:11,429
from where we are so we can change all

251
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:15,540
the pieces to create a nice one sort of

252
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,129
corporate web desktop that can start to

253
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:22,679
work the path that we want to follow so

254
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:26,040
we wanted to find a super user

255
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,319
experience we want to offer what users

256
00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:30,329
surely expecting from application

257
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:34,230
nowadays we wanted to try to rely on

258
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,259
open source software replacing all the

259
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:42,600
pieces that were closed were out of

260
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,610
maintenance and open the door to new

261
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,370
technologies under the Microsoft

262
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:50,429
spectral aspects okay we also wanted to

263
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:52,619
align with with the trend and Microsoft

264
00:12:52,619 --> 00:12:55,860
is sitting now and okay 50 it's a new

265
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,819
brand open source point of view that

266
00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:01,740
they are following now opening the

267
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,049
dotnet core code duello

268
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:06,269
actively developing it in each hub okay

269
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:08,579
we want to decouple also the front

270
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,220
on the backend and we try to use metal

271
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,100
libraries okay and again we want to

272
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,110
leverage in the existing knowledge in

273
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:19,860
the technologies that we have so

274
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,399
basically we started replacing from the

275
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:26,939
previous slide to start changing all the

276
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,879
technologies that we have we had for

277
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:33,269
example we we chose angular replacing

278
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:35,879
the old jQuery approach we switched from

279
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:38,850
the closed version of the.net framework

280
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,689
to development version 1 with Donetsk or

281
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:45,420
ok we're trying to run our business with

282
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,869
Donetsk or also switching also to be

283
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,660
open versions of entity framework and

284
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,499
optional adapter ok and if we compare

285
00:13:55,499 --> 00:13:57,600
with the previous one we are moving to a

286
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,689
more open solution rather than relying

287
00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:03,089
only in with the with the closed closed

288
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:07,110
person ok so getting into the technology

289
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,869
that we will chose ok then maybe there

290
00:14:09,869 --> 00:14:13,499
are several questions so what what we

291
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:16,350
changed ok with jQuery we found that

292
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,970
with this technology in the the

293
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:23,040
presentation layer engineers spread the

294
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,309
hate I don't like to work with HTML and

295
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:28,319
J's I don't know if you have also this

296
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:30,419
feeling in the past with you worked with

297
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:33,360
with this kind of technology that maybe

298
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,480
the people you work with don't like it

299
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,980
no we found ok so this may be the

300
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,540
engineers tend to do everything in

301
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,410
backends ok

302
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:47,610
ignoring in the network or hopes ok and

303
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,649
the per user experience that it is given

304
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:52,139
it was given to solutions so we switch

305
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:54,600
to an appear a client-side rendering

306
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,529
using angular ok so we try we tried to

307
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:04,379
have as low as the developer developer

308
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:08,519
learning curve as low as possible so now

309
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,769
the developers really loved the

310
00:15:10,769 --> 00:15:12,480
developing the front-end ok we found

311
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,880
that

312
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,900
when someone starts working with angular

313
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,520
at the beginning is a bit difficult but

314
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,380
in the middle term it's very very

315
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,850
positive for me the feedback that we

316
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:27,020
have we have from them so now you will

317
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,640
have a clear control okay on clear

318
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,740
vision from what is front end only

319
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,530
angular this is your presentation layer

320
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,990
and you cannot develop out of it on the

321
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:40,010
back end ok where where all the controls

322
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:43,100
and all the charcoal is running so this

323
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,490
give us a truly amazing user experience

324
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:53,900
and also a very good performance and

325
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,720
then this is the second major decision

326
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,850
that we've made over the the Microsoft

327
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,360
stack about removing completely

328
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,310
disservice side rendering ok

329
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:07,010
the developers are not allowed anymore

330
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:12,340
to do any HTML rendering in the backend

331
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,550
ok because we had serious issues with

332
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,080
the with the session handling and we

333
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,740
have very very difficult moments

334
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,810
handling the view estate because this is

335
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,810
very very big ok so we made this this

336
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:29,540
this I think brave decision because

337
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,670
sometimes this question is why you why

338
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,250
you do this what you remove the the back

339
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,590
in rendering so we think that is very

340
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:41,750
very positive when you are designing a

341
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:46,490
web solution more aware after one ok to

342
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:50,140
move this piece out

343
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:54,610
then we tried to move everything from

344
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,709
WCF that is a repertory technology from

345
00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:02,750
Microsoft that is very flexible but it's

346
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,849
also difficult to understand and it's

347
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:06,859
difficult to integrate with other

348
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,890
solutions okay for example if you try to

349
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:14,209
make a WCF connection to Java or PHP it

350
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:17,030
works sometimes very very difficult and

351
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,189
we try to make a simplified version of

352
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:23,089
this WCF using SP net web api and

353
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:26,839
swagger to offer all to offer to the to

354
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,520
defund it all the information that it

355
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,370
needs so at the end you have a front end

356
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:33,980
with a lot of HTML applications that are

357
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,070
consuming okay all these information

358
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,980
from rest ApS but at the end this is so

359
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:46,940
so much simple the service layer we also

360
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:53,200
removed ok all the all these

361
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,330
applications ok all these processes that

362
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:04,630
is running inside the VI is OK the

363
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,730
services were also a difficult piece to

364
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,960
to work with

365
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,850
we are very tied to the windows

366
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:13,250
infrastructure so we switched also the

367
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,530
services layer to donate core and we had

368
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:20,690
also the ability to run this our code in

369
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:24,320
red hot in I'm going to in Mac OS apart

370
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,080
from from windows ok we are opening the

371
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,390
the hosting abilities that we have with

372
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:34,090
our current existing the net core code

373
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,559
everything that this in.net cannot be

374
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,840
directly migrated to donate core because

375
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,030
not all the api is from the framework

376
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:45,530
are being current the open source so you

377
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:48,290
have the limitation that the dotnet core

378
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,929
is a subset of the bigger framework from

379
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:53,660
Microsoft so not all the codes can be

380
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:57,490
migrated but a vast majority of it

381
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:00,530
in terms of data access and in the in

382
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,350
the bottom of the of the technology

383
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,610
stack we've worked with with Microsoft

384
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,520
technologies for long also we will lay

385
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,470
it first with data sets then with entity

386
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,660
framework in this previous closed source

387
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,970
relation and now we are switching to the

388
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,920
operation one with the different world

389
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,410
one core and also we are giving the

390
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,480
developers the chance to work with this

391
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,330
double that it is an open source library

392
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,280
from stack overflow that is very very

393
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,440
fast you know read operations so we are

394
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,360
giving the chance to the group us to

395
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,040
choose the right tool for the right

396
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:43,160
access data access moment ok then at the

397
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,929
level of the framework we are removed

398
00:19:44,929 --> 00:19:49,970
all the old enterprise library I don't

399
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,860
know if even you've worked anyone with

400
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,220
these Enterprise libraries in the past

401
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:59,450
ok from Microsoft that Microsoft lately

402
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,669
removed the support and stopped

403
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:05,390
developing them so we had you had to

404
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:08,870
switch to two other copy install

405
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:12,559
solutions to run to run the injection

406
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,750
dependency and the properties mapping

407
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:19,510
and so on ok any questions so far about

408
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:24,799
the stack okay continue ok at logging

409
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,900
level also we also relate in the past

410
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,120
with the Microsoft patterns and

411
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,760
practices logging blocked and we made

412
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,309
the switch okay to to this common log in

413
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:38,690
a solution that is in the Java world is

414
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,970
widely known and this is quite standard

415
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:49,400
nowadays and from a hosting point of

416
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,200
bill we relied always with the microsoft

417
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,830
iis for all the applications and now

418
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,440
we're moving to an area where donut core

419
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,870
bring us the ability to deploy to any

420
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,790
container solution that we have in the

421
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:08,660
market so all the problems that you may

422
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,640
have and in the past host

423
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,130
applications within the IES like we've

424
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,860
seen know you have a problem you have a

425
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,290
have to change a digital certificate

426
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:20,570
from the server and all the applications

427
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,900
stop working and so on they are all gone

428
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,480
because you can create a packages of

429
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,470
your application and deploy them to two

430
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,330
other systems and this is I think that

431
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,250
that docker is one of the the core

432
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,920
technologies that bring bring bring me

433
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,540
the idea know that we can create small

434
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,010
packages like on we can create small

435
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,010
containers with our software modules

436
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,470
with any technology and we can deploy it

437
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:51,410
in a way an app store does so I think

438
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,200
that docker is the starting point what

439
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,740
were the idea the idea came in and

440
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:02,660
debase okay to create this disk operate

441
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:08,720
work desktop and last but not least in

442
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,780
terms of security we have extensively

443
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,670
relate with Active Directory Federation

444
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:16,400
services windows authentication okay and

445
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,010
the windows and entity foundation module

446
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:23,060
from Microsoft we are switching to an

447
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,640
open source solution okay but you can

448
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,290
freely download github that this code

449
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:29,750
identity server okay identity server is

450
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:34,210
a solution that it follows the open ID

451
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,420
connected specification it is WS

452
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,910
Federation compatible it can work with

453
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:43,280
all the previous the scenarios you found

454
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,950
in enterprises okay and this one has an

455
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,190
asp.net entity extension out of the box

456
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,410
that means that you can you can create

457
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,900
any application using Microsoft stack

458
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,330
and connected to a central single

459
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:02,120
sign-on solution and that it's also free

460
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,770
for you you need you don't need to pay

461
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,150
anything okay

462
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,030
to get up and running a basic solution

463
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:11,780
for handling these certifications okay

464
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,190
what I think that is especially

465
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:15,380
important because also the point that

466
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,140
the most of companies have found how can

467
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:22,640
I handle these scenarios where I you

468
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,860
need to

469
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,350
the single sign-on well you need to

470
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,000
create custom integrations to

471
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,160
authenticate your users no I need to

472
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,830
form factional dedications what can do

473
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,080
you can purchase a product market that

474
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,570
they are going to to build you for the

475
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,760
product and then any modifications on

476
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,000
any plugins you need so you can download

477
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,520
at the police project you can customize

478
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,880
customize it you can be to compliant and

479
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,590
you can run it also inside a container

480
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:53,140
so at the end it's giving us a great

481
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,450
flexibility to work this I had to work

482
00:23:55,450 --> 00:24:01,780
on this okay so at the the point of the

483
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:05,470
first stage stage of the of the idea we

484
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:07,120
have a very simple resource to the

485
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,320
solution okay

486
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,100
that has a to clear software pieces ok

487
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,549
the front end based in HTML and J's only

488
00:24:15,549 --> 00:24:18,070
on the back end with donuts with dotnet

489
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,919
solutions ok and a single sign-on

490
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:22,780
solution that we can fully customized to

491
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:26,860
any client and any needs they have ok we

492
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,660
can offer for the first time in the

493
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,679
history deploy to any a platform the

494
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,679
clients may may may need in the data

495
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,570
centers ok also important the design of

496
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,910
this framework allows us to change any

497
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,770
technology for example if we don't want

498
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:47,860
in the future to develop using Microsoft

499
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,080
technologies it's a piece in the

500
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,030
architecture that we can't replace we

501
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:54,790
can use Java PHP or we can create a vast

502
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:57,370
echo system of developers using several

503
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:03,700
languages ok so I think that in the near

504
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,130
future following this path creating

505
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:09,490
architecture that can be put inside

506
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:13,690
containers that can be fully tuned an

507
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,700
app store and then can be deployed to

508
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,549
several enterprises

509
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:20,770
it's something that maybe not

510
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,809
revolutionary but I think that this is a

511
00:25:22,809 --> 00:25:25,330
real need for a company to create a

512
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,770
desktop and have this ability to

513
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:29,530
download an application automatically

514
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:33,730
update and and so no and so on

515
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:38,919
that's all that's all for my part if you

516
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:44,169
have any question regarding the idea the

517
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:53,909
concept not at the moment because we

518
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:56,769
have not the ability right now to

519
00:25:56,769 --> 00:26:00,909
publish anything ok because we we are

520
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:04,720
funding the idea is private funding from

521
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,200
companies that is paying for private

522
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,870
projects but we hope in the soon to be

523
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,269
able to publish something that we can

524
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:15,580
share with the community really hope I

525
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:18,130
hope and power quorum if I'm wrong that

526
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,519
we may find out the way to open-source

527
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:46,720
these tools so there are 4 sig agrees to

528
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,929
release more next week with the guy in

529
00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:55,720
charge of the cross of a stop saying

530
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,649
whatever they're called will program

531
00:26:59,649 --> 00:27:02,679
that which will pay the way to this is

532
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:04,289
one of this

533
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,970
goes for the company for the next two

534
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:11,229
years but open sourcing and opening are

535
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:12,609
having more clubs evolved and

536
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:14,799
communities and making by a lot of the

537
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,440
product itself but of the service around

538
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,409
it so visually but I think we can show

539
00:27:20,409 --> 00:27:22,989
you can show it on the screen like

540
00:27:22,989 --> 00:27:25,029
starting a medium one the a plants are

541
00:27:25,029 --> 00:27:30,220
on Sunday live Sun application you mean

542
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:38,440
showing no no half nah I don't have the

543
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,450
axis right here because we need to VPN

544
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,389
on everything so Adam immunity is from

545
00:27:43,389 --> 00:27:45,489
possible I hope that with the soon we

546
00:27:45,489 --> 00:28:03,220
can okay we've doing one interesting

547
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:06,940
project that was a a big system that is

548
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,799
making the forecast purchasing from a

549
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,169
supermarket in Spain and what we've

550
00:28:11,169 --> 00:28:14,220
basically done is group moving are

551
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,779
removing all the all presentation layer

552
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:20,499
and put in place a new a new front end

553
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:22,629
okay so this is a partial migration of

554
00:28:22,629 --> 00:28:25,149
abaca applications and then we have

555
00:28:25,149 --> 00:28:29,259
we've been able to create this WPF no

556
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:32,830
sorry this Web API that is posting all

557
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:35,320
the the legacy services on all the the

558
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,190
information that has not been modified

559
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:42,309
because in terms of time and money was

560
00:28:42,309 --> 00:28:45,489
not feasible to recreate everything from

561
00:28:45,489 --> 00:28:48,669
scratch and create this solution using

562
00:28:48,669 --> 00:28:52,720
this new framework okay is that you have

563
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,609
two scenarios may basically you can

564
00:28:54,609 --> 00:28:56,950
start from scratch this out of money is

565
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:59,529
a critical application you can go layer

566
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,450
by layer replacing until the

567
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:04,710
technologies that is running

568
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,320
and stuff you could do on a big desktop

569
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,410
applications such as printing and going

570
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,600
to a browser based approach did it the

571
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,600
users liked the final result was it

572
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,190
please repeat honey sorry

573
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,190
so how was the transition from a desktop

574
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,380
application better to do things like

575
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:27,110
print eagle playing sounds to a

576
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:31,550
web-based application did you okay yeah

577
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,560
the point is that the application that

578
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,890
this in this concrete case was also our

579
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:40,700
our web application okay a very old web

580
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,430
application that was it was not an isle

581
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,800
on the company so we've put this tool

582
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,050
inside this web desktop and started

583
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:50,360
working so for the uses was really nice

584
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,600
because as I said the user experience is

585
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,820
10 years in the technology world that is

586
00:29:55,820 --> 00:30:01,990
like a hundred years in for us

587
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:24,440
Oh tight that all the years are very

588
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,920
very decoupled at the only point of a

589
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,030
coupling between the presentation the

590
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:31,460
back end is the arrest service so rest

591
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,450
services so you can easily change

592
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:37,100
angular for react for instance if you

593
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,710
feel more comfortable or whatever or

594
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,390
even you can combine two technologies

595
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,130
because at the end the desktop is not

596
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:46,250
it's a framework that is rendering HTML

597
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,830
for the user so you can even combine

598
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,840
these two technologies based on the only

599
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,600
real needs of the client we are relying

600
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,940
on angular we started one year and a

601
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,430
half ago we chose we started with

602
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:01,850
angular one - I think we we found that

603
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:04,660
was really productive we have very good

604
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:07,460
feedback from the engineers that started

605
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,250
were switching from from the old

606
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:13,430
Microsoft paradigm of MVC or web forms

607
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:16,790
to angular and I think that we've made

608
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:19,400
in the past the right choice and we need

609
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,590
to see now what happens if we great to

610
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:27,590
angular 2 or maybe change - to react or

611
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,930
what flows or whatever ok this is

612
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,340
something that we need to discuss you

613
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,800
need to discuss now my personal bet is

614
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,960
to to keep deal to keep going to angular

615
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,010
because it gives us good would this was

616
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:42,290
in the past they've fixing the main one

617
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:43,490
of the main problems that they had in

618
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:45,170
the past was the performance they made a

619
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:48,560
big change to to attack this this issue

620
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,020
that they had now so let's see let's see

621
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,500
what happens

622
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:02,550
things like Internet Explorer now in 10

623
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:07,690
we had we have to bring super to

624
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:10,720
Internet Explorer because since paint is

625
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,240
pain especially I'm from balancing the

626
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,270
Valencia region is very Microsoft prone

627
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,510
they have a lot of Internet Explorer 8

628
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:23,170
19 so we are very very tight to the also

629
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,270
to the angular duration 1/4 because we

630
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,730
need to grant the functionality in these

631
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:30,100
old browsers at the same time where

632
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,960
we're trying to the clients to upgrade

633
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,690
the browser because for us it's a pain

634
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:36,940
because we need we need to create a lot

635
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,580
of tests and we need to use selenium and

636
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:42,520
automate everything and we need to even

637
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,040
develop patches to make the the all the

638
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,440
things work fine because in chrome

639
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,530
everything works perfect but when you go

640
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:52,960
to interest rate and about you know you

641
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,270
also saw this issue in Internet Explorer

642
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,550
9 or 9 or 10 I don't know with the

643
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:01,930
version 9 the respirator 9 had serious

644
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:04,840
issues when you open a lot of icing

645
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,990
operations at the same time because it

646
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:10,690
so it is really it's difficult but it's

647
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:22,450
also a challenge for us so many problems

648
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:34,770
I'm here and so so quickly quickly last

649
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:38,440
longer than a couple of years you have

650
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,890
to support 8 10 20 browser version

651
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,690
it's difficult for corporate

652
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,240
applications that only get a biggie

653
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:53,659
maybe once or twice a year they go two

654
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:55,429
or three years worth to tower with no

655
00:33:55,429 --> 00:33:59,480
updates and I think that that part of

656
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,990
equation is not really ticketed by the

657
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:06,200
browser developers or the web framework

658
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,730
developers physical I work for an

659
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:13,159
automation company and the kind of

660
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,080
products that we offer for defense and

661
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,449
intercept evasion last for 20 or 30

662
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:22,219
years so we develop an application in

663
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:25,879
delfield I was short at the same binary

664
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:30,530
world followed with Windows 25 to

665
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:36,770
Windows 10 say binary compatible

666
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:39,730
developed over anything but it was very

667
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:45,830
boring but for about pork I had a 20th

668
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,750
spot life span revivification

669
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:54,109
now with a web application I that's

670
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:57,549
where they were with I and

671
00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:05,390
they started off in the application and

672
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,460
after six months would they are still

673
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,440
developing application in development

674
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,830
works with the browser that used to work

675
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:15,020
it's no which now we have a new era

676
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,630
first kind of Chrome or Firefox or okay

677
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,220
I have changed the rendering engine or

678
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:31,580
whatever and and when something breaks

679
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:34,369
we should rate you the caps are glazed

680
00:35:34,369 --> 00:35:42,080
you also on also dependency on all

681
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:45,940
products you purchase a product

682
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:52,549
it's worth that you buy a very big

683
00:35:52,549 --> 00:35:55,009
product for your business around any

684
00:35:55,009 --> 00:35:56,390

mention before and you they give you

686
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,059
support for in test four and nine and

687
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:04,509
this software should spend from ten to

688
00:36:04,509 --> 00:36:07,930
fifteen years twenty years and you are

689
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:10,430
blocked to this version of the browsers

690
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:12,079
and it's very very difficult to handle

691
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,009
situations but also this the web

692
00:36:16,009 --> 00:36:18,319

693
00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:20,749
