1
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:16,930
are you ready okay so welcome everybody

2
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,349
we are here to praise to talk about our

3
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:23,040
project Calliope and it's about Mary

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,480
privacy and X matrix in digital

5
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,230
communication

6
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,759
I am Emmerich and I am Stan we have to

7
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:32,800
speak with man we meet microphone for

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,360
both so it's really something okay thank

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,950
you so we are probably in Texas what is

10
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,760
privacy you know all what is privacy but

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,490
in digital communication I think that we

12
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,170
lost all of her privacy

13
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,960
so Kerri open is a project is a project

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,220
to bring back to users their privacy we

15
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,250
will describe all we want to make this

16
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:12,310
possible okay Cali open under of private

17
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:15,520
sections today is not about email when

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,950
we communicate it's about me Moochie

19
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,970
protocols it can be Skype it can be

20
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,830
Twitter the direct message it can be

21
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,570
facebook Messenger a lot of on sums are

22
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,670
oriented for privacy like sign sign all

23
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,020
telegram for end-to-end encryption and

24
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,880
guarantee that people get the privacy

25
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,920
and communication and only be between

26
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,700
users but we don't speak about protocols

27
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,950
we want to speak about contents about

28
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,360
whoa discus with room it's not when we

29
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,000
speak with Twitter or Facebook is not

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,320
only protocols it's about people

31
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,140
speaking together so Caliban is

32
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,780
discussion oriented is not protocol we

33
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,970
want to gather all communication between

34
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,400
same people on the same place on the

35
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,959
same discussions protocol smarter only

36
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,180
for privacy privacy measurements

37
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,720
it's about depending on protocol user we

38
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,750
not the same Travis ish and so Calipari

39
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,050
will try to have to compute that privacy

40
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,540
by certain protocols but not only

41
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,500
protocols

42
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,200
it's about all other things that

43
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:40,030
interact between people communicating so

44
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,760
privacy and X is nothing new

45
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,840
maybe I'm an old geezer with a view

46
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,850
schnook in France but I was used to be

47
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,790
able to know when something is private

48
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:00,740
or not when I send a letter and I put it

49
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,620
in an Arab I seal the envelope and I

50
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,250
know that no one else then the recipient

51
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,150
can read it and if I send a postcard and

52
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,570
I write on my postcard my address and

53
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,390
the code to enter to my home and I say

54
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,720
you can find the key just on the right

55
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,260
of of my jaw I know that it's not

56
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,560
private and that everybody can read the

57
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,769
postcard and see what's on it

58
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:34,820
so it's easy for me to it was easy for

59
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,030
me to to to know when something is

60
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,000
private and what is when it's not

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,250
private and the problem is it should be

62
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,860
the same on the internet we should be

63
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,420
able to to see easily when something is

64
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,799
private and when it's not private but it

65
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:02,420
seems that it's not really the case we

66
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,970
are losing the control of our mailbox or

67
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:09,590
our and over our communication we don't

68
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,040
know exactly what's happened and what's

69
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:19,488
going on so we need to have some matrix

70
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:24,350
or some something just to to show to see

71
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:28,160
that something is private or less and

72
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,590
more prevents

73
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:35,950
this is the other problem issue that we

74
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,930
can say on the Internet's and something

75
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,500
is private or it's not private something

76
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,950
it's a level of privacy the shades of

77
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:52,660
privacy and we we need to see that to

78
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:57,910
feel it and to be able to have something

79
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:03,850
as easy that is Annie in the in the real

80
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:08,520
life with later with paper with envelop

81
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:15,340
so where we need to recreate in digital

82
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,760
age what was easy to understand in the

83
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,560
paper age okay but the fact is the

84
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,479
internet was not designed for that

85
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:28,540
purpose when it was built

86
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,260
it's about telnet FTP communications are

87
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,640
in clear text on the wire and also SMTP

88
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,780
with multiple Haley milky Bob is not

89
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,870
secure there is not privacy it's clear

90
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:48,850
text over to Santa Annette and starting

91
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,210
at nine ninety five ninety five SS ash

92
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,550
happy Rose also jealous

93
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:59,350
at the time but it's not for users TLS

94
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,650
and SSL and TLS was built to guarantee

95
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,919
bank transactions over Antionette to

96
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,650
permit to have the number card number to

97
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,289
not be in clear on the wire it's normal

98
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:14,250
we want to have this credit card number

99
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,930
visible but all and mistletoe by all

100
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:21,150
people that can be desire can be Cesar

101
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,360
the flows on an Internet it's a poor

102
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,870
Emma

103
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:30,010
so no in this century which try to be

104
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:33,220
the week began to have a new protocols

105
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,780
new secretion possibilities but as I

106
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,659
said if this parrot is multi protocols

107
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:42,340
its many things

108
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,669
you have a mini way to communicate with

109
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:50,680
each other's today email can be secured

110
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,100
for me I'm a taking him up guy I know I

111
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,080
can secure me nervous that's not harm my

112
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,090
communications only the body the content

113
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:03,550
of the message can be encrypted metadata

114
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,380
still exists and can be top tepid by

115
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,260
governments or also others people's it's

116
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,330
a real problem it's a real problem for

117
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:18,190
privacy we can know who speak with womb

118
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,520
we have metadata give a lot of

119
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,669
formations maybe more than for the

120
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:27,610
contents himself such will be a short

121
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,700
message with no interest but metadata is

122
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,220
really important and we have to find a

123
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,950
way image throughout this program dark

124
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,590
male aliens try to find a way to evolve

125
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,979
SMTP protocols to make it more secure on

126
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:45,930
leaked less metadata other protocols

127
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,720
acting and to any encryptions want to

128
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,020
hide much metadata as possible that's

129
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:57,160
where we are but is it enough is it

130
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,789
complete no it's not because multi

131
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:03,340
protocols music sings and OH

132
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:12,130
what how can we do that so many many

133
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,560
tools Louise are not secure at all

134
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,630
facebook Messenger Twitter direct

135
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,930
message are not we can use a bit of PGP

136
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:24,160
in these protocols but who who protects

137
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,849
this kind of things I said no one see

138
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:36,490
someone use PGP in a Facebook No yeah ok

139
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,099
that's fine but you can't use it on your

140
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:41,169
smartphone with a bishop is only

141
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:43,179
available on your browser side with

142
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:46,000
Facebook when you enable PGP you can't

143
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,959
use int anymore

144
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,260
it's a problem because our usage is also

145
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,940
with other device we was up price so we

146
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,880
have to

147
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,510
find a way to show Oh

148
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:05,300
it's secure or not so but as I say

149
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,280
metadata is important because it's

150
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,280
exposed all our social graph we speak

151
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:15,380
about social networks so we have a lot

152
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,180
of friend of a friend of friends on

153
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,450
facebook on Twitter on all those yes

154
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,970
power or source tools like this it's

155
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,710
important we have to interact with

156
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,350
people we know with for professional for

157
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,170
personal reasons but it's really a

158
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,480
problem because it's not a technical

159
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,820
port it's not about the protocols or

160
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,070
insights is about you speak with whom

161
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:41,870
and when I am a user securing myself on

162
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,830
my emails maybe I will speak with other

163
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,430
peoples and peoples are on gafas

164
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:54,500
provider like Google Facebook or others

165
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,440
and it's very important because I can

166
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,100
get all my interest to be get a privacy

167
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,670
but my contact won't have so it's not

168
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,330
it's not ok we lose a part of the

169
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,010
provider

170
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,900
it's important to get back to get this

171
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,230
and this interesting about a social

172
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:26,720
graph so digital age and closes the act

173
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,510
of communicating in too technical black

174
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:33,170
boxes making very difficult for us to

175
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:36,590
understand what's underlined what's we

176
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,050
want to do with Cali open and with the

177
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:43,550
privacy index is to make privacy very

178
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,640
visible again that's our main goal

179
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,780
make privacy visible again we need to

180
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:56,360
find how we can and when I say we I

181
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,900
speak as a community of developers we

182
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,530
need to find how to make privacy visible

183
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,890
again and to build user interface that

184
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,920
always show

185
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,510
how why what level of privacy you are in

186
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,279
with the person you're communicating

187
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,519
with or when wiII you send this kind of

188
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:22,889
message with this kind of channel and

189
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:27,180
this way we don't want to to guilty

190
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,170
the the user and to make them

191
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,779
responsible something like this of doing

192
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:39,850
bad action by sending message with low

193
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:43,779
privacy level of insecure Channel we

194
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:47,529
just want to show our privacy privacy

195
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:53,529
here to make to give the desired for the

196
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:56,500
user to improve their privacy index and

197
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,889
to change their behavior and to change

198
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:03,779
where they communicate and to ask for

199
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:09,370
tools for the the platforms they use to

200
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:14,230
be more informational about what is the

201
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,630
privacy what is the protocol underlying

202
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:21,850
what's happening and to have tools that

203
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:27,640
can be it easy to use as the the

204
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,079
envelope and later in the envelope is so

205
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,260
that's real the challenge we want to

206
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,959
bring on the table with Cali open

207
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:41,920
because we are at an early stage of the

208
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,430
of the process of building this privacy

209
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,000
and X and this user interface but we

210
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,370
have starts started the the process and

211
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:56,800
and we want to build this kind of user

212
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,100
interface that can make the privacy

213
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:07,690
again visible so it's about privacy and

214
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,910
actually the way I just pick about a

215
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,880
mailbox but inside so me all a way to

216
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,920
communicate and like it's what said

217
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,740
before you can draw up image people

218
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,500
still using him as my bank communicate

219
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,660
with me

220
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,840
image other friends it's a sign cool

221
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,780
process and we can coop itself easily

222
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:32,880
but so email it's a technically easy to

223
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,500
get measurements for the privacy all

224
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:44,160
secured watches was it it's a we which

225
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,210
which really was used was secure

226
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,820
protocol used on the end damage

227
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,400
terminate at termination of the

228
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,990
connection the network communication

229
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:58,680
communication the content also is it PGP

230
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:04,050
or some things is all metadata are works

231
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,930
Likud for practice in PGP for example is

232
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,660
not to set up subject on the email that

233
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,630
is related with the content because you

234
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:15,810
will leak metadata we leak a part of the

235
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,330
message you want to deliver privately

236
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:21,270
it's not ok but it's only the technical

237
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:28,590
part and as I will always say with also

238
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,080
others aspect like I said the social

239
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,050
graph is important so privacy is not

240
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,390
only technical it's about other

241
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:40,530
dimensions it's like social like stencil

242
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:44,850
behavior during the time

243
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:51,020
oh I use my communication tools do I

244
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,600
still want to have a privacy and

245
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,900
continue to use to strictly PGP or

246
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:03,780
others encryption tools but is also an

247
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,970
important part like we said before is

248
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:09,600
about the contextual usage of our

249
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,620
communication where we use the

250
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,480
communication tools is it at home with

251
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,250
hard work is it in a public place or in

252
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,520
the tube on the booster Metro ok it's

253
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,980
not this part of usage is really

254
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,700
important because

255
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,960
because it's a really it's a new usage

256
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,080
smartphone bring us a new type of use as

257
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,720
much before it was dick stop at home at

258
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,240
work after it was laptop we can bring

259
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,899
here and know also smartphones important

260
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:47,120
device it's also an important part of

261
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:53,209
the analogies yeah so the device case as

262
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:58,120
a shaman said we can we think as

263
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,399
developer on the Kali open project and

264
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:03,860
and working on the privacy on Dex we

265
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,320
think that we can easily build some

266
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,430
matrix for the technical point of view

267
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:13,339
museum our the protocol was our security

268
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:17,870
was what was the options email the ADA

269
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,620
was enclosed or not etc today is it's

270
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,990
not easy very easy but it's not very

271
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,779
difficult to assess this but there are a

272
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:31,490
lot of other issues and information to

273
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,950
take account to to try to build a

274
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:37,130
privacy index like for example the

275
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:40,610
device I'm using is it a smartphone is

276
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:44,450
it a laptop this is it can influence the

277
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:49,279
privacy on decks but what kind of what

278
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,140
kind of smartphone is it is it an

279
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,140
Android is it an iPhone it influenced

280
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,990
the privacy and X and what is the

281
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:00,380
connection is it a GSM connection now is

282
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,890
it a Wi-Fi is it a public Wi-Fi or is it

283
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,920
a private Wi-Fi is it a Wi-Fi in Tunisia

284
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,109
a gray palette ah

285
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:15,740
means States enforce that's okay

286
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,199
I'm the state of Tunisia and I say this

287
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:22,040
wafer is okay no so we need to take

288
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,189
account of all this kind of contextual

289
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:30,410
and be a royal information to build the

290
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:33,410
privacy and xoz what we want to sell

291
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:38,450
today is that we as developer we need to

292
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:41,270
take account the privacy and X and try

293
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,210
to calculate its on the type

294
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,919
we call point of view but we as

295
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:49,409
developer need also to work with

296
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,570
psychologists sociologists a lot of

297
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:56,200
other you UX designer a lot of other

298
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,480
competencies to help us to bring all the

299
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,620
use case that builds a privacy index and

300
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,980
to try to find how we can take account

301
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:15,730
of all the contextual and not only is a

302
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:26,020
technical one and so the challenge is

303
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,600
that it would be great if we can build

304
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,140
software that could prevent me or help

305
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,200
me to exchange important message over

306
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,059
poor privacy channels or with

307
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:41,640
correspondents that have poor privacy

308
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:49,270
index again it's not the the aim is not

309
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:53,440
to to be guilty but just to help user to

310
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,289
make the right choice in the right

311
00:18:56,289 --> 00:19:01,090
situation with the right context for the

312
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:04,419
right message and because today in

313
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:09,309
digital age it's very very tough to do

314
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:13,570
this choice because we don't know so we

315
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:17,140
need this kind of software and that's

316
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:21,450
what we are trying to do with Kelly open

317
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:24,970
its about displaying a flag monkey-see

318
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:27,820
monkey-do what it's about it's like a

319
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:34,059
stan said it's a the envelope later

320
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:37,390
it's a open will show a provision decks

321
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:40,990
with informations about technical behave

322
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,260
we are all those dimensions about

323
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,679
communication privacy considerations

324
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:50,710
this information will be available for a

325
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:54,130
each element in Kalapana a message about

326
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,060
privacy

327
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,270
contact other privacy also but also the

328
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,790
users using gallopin of its own

329
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:05,090
provision decks an indie their ideal

330
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:08,750
world users on Calliope and who can be

331
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,750
able to see other user privacy and X and

332
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,840
know oh I can come in it with this other

333
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,300
users in a privately in privacy manner

334
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,530
it's about all of that

335
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,440
the time is helped so I have to to stop

336
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:31,700
and it's a network you are you have we

337
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,960
want to bring a community to to get

338
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,300
privacy back to all users not technical

339
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:43,040
guys that we are we are able to do to

340
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,640
encrypt communications Laxus so no we

341
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,340
have to bring back to all users their

342
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:49,930
privacy

343
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:53,540
Caliban have to be a simple tools to

344
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,990
make possible to see all provide is all

345
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:01,280
of our communications so thank you ok

346
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,430
yeah thank you again and just join us

347

00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:10,280
part with participation excuse me we are

349
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,800
here for the first presentation of Kali

350
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,110
open and privacy and X so this is really

351
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,840
work in progress we're at the beginning

352
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,240
of the process where wall team on this

353
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,810
and we hopefully come next year to show

354
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:27,470
you what we have done in one year but we

355
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:30,530
need help with for from other developer

356
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:34,540
and not only developers thank you

357
00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:44,320
you have two minutes for questions

358
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:17,219
we have a two-year project now with MVP

359
00:22:17,219 --> 00:22:21,839
for our Calliope and so we have an alpha

360
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:25,259
project for October of this year's it's

361
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:28,229
a two-year project actually with UPMC

362
00:22:28,229 --> 00:22:30,389
University Polling on Marie Curie and

363
00:22:30,389 --> 00:22:33,289
quand on ganja net where we are working

364
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:38,099
well and it will be a alpha release for

365
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:42,719
make use of testing oh that will be AB

366
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:46,679
take this project so the the MVP will be

367
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:48,779
a platform to exchange email basically

368
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:52,859
the first will be on email and with how

369
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:55,289
we can show privacy and X on the

370
00:22:55,289 --> 00:22:58,949
interface but we don't know really if we

371
00:22:58,949 --> 00:23:01,529
will be able to calculate some privacy

372
00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:06,769
and X this October yeah

373
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:56,330
okay so the question was there are a lot

374
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:59,090
of buyers when we want to assess privacy

375
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:01,550
on decks because we have to make your

376
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:04,370
lot of assumptions and we have a lot of

377
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:07,340
is there a lot of three areas we don't

378
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,040
know something and that's that's the

379
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,340
issue that that's what is difficult to

380
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,680
calculate the privates index and really

381
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,980
I we don't know how to do it but we want

382
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:22,340
to to do it step by step so first we

383
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,910
will ask Museo what we can measure so

384
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:29,120
what we can we can definitely see when

385
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,380
what something comes or when and we we

386
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:40,090
want to slightly gather more and more

387
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:46,270
contributors and maybe proposal maybe

388
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:51,550
IDs and to find how we can assess the

389
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:55,430
kind of user case you you you you spoke

390
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:59,120
about and and to see how we can under

391
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,010
this and we with we think that we counts

392
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:06,890
are just one metrics to measure of

393
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:10,730
privacy and X we we will need to balance

394
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:14,270
between between different metrics and we

395
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:17,960
think it's it may be it may takes years

396
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,800
to build the privacy on decks yeah

397
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,070
because there is a lot of gray area and

398
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:27,380
it's very difficult but that's why we

399
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,580
are in and we want to together

400
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,170
communities around this concert

401
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:36,980
because we needed time's up time's up

402
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,610
thank you

403
